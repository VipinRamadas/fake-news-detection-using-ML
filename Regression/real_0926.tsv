Extreme inebriation is also central in the account of a third accuser.

Kavanaugh faced a whirlwind of new accusations on Wednesday that threatened to derail his nomination to the Supreme Court as key Republican senators wavered in their support and President Trump, in a rambling and combative news conference, acknowledged that he might be persuaded by the testimony of one of the judge’s female accusers.

On the eve of an extraordinary hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee at which both Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who has accused him of assaulting her when they were both teenagers, will testify, Mr. Trump said that “some very evil” Democrats had plotted to destroy Judge Kavanaugh’s reputation. And he lamented what he called “a very dangerous period in our country” in which men are presumed guilty.

But even as he described the charges against Judge Kavanaugh as “false accusations,” Mr. Trump seemed, for the first time, to acknowledge the mounting challenges facing his nominee. Asked why he repeatedly sides with men over their female accusers, the president said hearing stories from Dr. Blasey might change his mind.

“I’m going to see what happens tomorrow,” Mr. Trump said during an hourlong news conference in New York, where he was attending the United Nations General Assembly. “I’m going to be watching, you know, believe it or not. It’s possible they will be convincing.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/us/politics/27dc-kavanaugh1/27dc-kavanaugh1-facebookJumbo.jpg

On Wednesday afternoon, more than 60 classmates from Georgetown Prep and women from sister schools who say they knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school signed a letter to rebut Ms. Swetnick’s allegations and deny ever having met her. “We never witnessed any behavior that even approaches what is described in this allegation. It is reprehensible,” said the letter, which was addressed to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Brett Kavanaugh is a good man. He has always treated women with respect and decency.”

Mr. Avenatti had been using his Twitter account for days to promote what he said would be explosive allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. And immediately after he shared what he called a sworn affidavit from Ms. Swetnick, it drew immediate coverage across social media and cable news as another revelation to rock the confirmation process.

Asked in a brief interview why Ms. Swetnick would be attending parties with high schoolers during her college years, Mr. Avenatti said that the parties in question included people of both high school and college ages.

Mr. Avenatti said he had corroborating witnesses who could back up Ms. Swetnick’s accounts, but was not ready to present them because he was waiting to see if the Senate Judiciary Committee would begin a full investigation into her claims as he demanded, along with an F.B.I. inquiry. In her statement, Ms. Swetnick said she would be willing to appear before the committee.

In an email to Mr. Avenatti on Wednesday afternoon, Mike Davis, the committee’s chief nominations counsel, offered to arrange an interview with Ms. Swetnick.

“Please let me know immediately whether your client will agree to an interview by committee investigators today,” Mr. Davis wrote in the email, which was obtained by The Times. “We can do a telephone interview anytime this afternoon or evening.”

In recent days, Judge Kavanaugh and Mr. Trump, who nominated him in July, have been pushing back against the allegations relating to Judge Kavanaugh’s treatment of women. Mr. Trump called the claims a “con game” by Democrats who were “trying to delay and obstruct his confirmation.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/us/27Swetnick-print/27Swetnick1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg

Kavanaugh, a 1990 graduate of the school.

That was after a campus sit-in that prompted the cancellation of many classes, and protests in Washington, D.C., where two of their colleagues were arrested, and a blistering email that a group of students sent out to their classmates and faculty that said that the Kavanaugh nomination had exposed “our entire school’s culture of legal elitism and fixation on proximity to power.”

It was an abrupt shift on campus. In the days after Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination in June, the school’s website boasted that, if confirmed, he would be the fourth sitting member of the Supreme Court who had gone to Yale. The school’s dean, Heather K. Gerken, called him “a longtime friend to many of us in the Yale Law School community.” Other professors praised him.

Now, in the wake of recent troubling allegations linked to the school, the authors of the email said many students felt even more “alienated, disillusioned, and frustrated with the ambivalence and moral abdication of this institution, its faculty, and its administration.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/nyregion/27yale3/merlin_144256749_4936c343-1bd2-487e-bd9f-e5562f64270f-facebookJumbo.jpg

Kavanaugh Must Defend but Not Attack.	1	"WASHINGTON — President Trump has some advice for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as he prepares for Thursday’s climactic Senate hearing to confront sexual misconduct allegations: Be more aggressive, show more outrage, push back more. In other words, be more like Mr. Trump.

But what works for Mr. Trump might not work for Judge Kavanaugh. His challenge is not to look like he is attacking his accusers. Anger could touch off a backlash, advisers said, though at the same time he needs to show more indignation than he did during a Fox News interview on Monday when he stuck closely to talking points and looked rehearsed.

For Christine Blasey Ford, the California university professor who will testify about the night she said a drunken Mr. Kavanaugh held her down on a bed and tried to remove her clothes, the challenge is different. An unknown figure, she will be introducing herself to the senators and the nation for the first time, explaining who she is, what happened 36 years ago and why her account is more credible than his denial. She faces a veteran sex crimes prosecutor who will question her for Republicans, a scenario that could rattle even a more seasoned witness.

In her case, according to political veterans, details will matter. She has not been able to determine the date or location of the incident, so the more she can recall about the event, the more specific her account is, the stronger her case will be. She is no veteran of the klieg-light culture of Washington."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/us/politics/27dc-prepare-sub/27dc-prepare-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg

Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, a common theme has emerged connecting the decades-old alleged incidents: heavy drinking.

Christine Blasey Ford described Judge Kavanaugh as “stumbling drunk” when, as a 17-year-old prep school student in suburban Washington, he allegedly tried to force himself on her during a party in 1982. Then, at an alcohol-fueled gathering during his freshman year at Yale, his former classmate Deborah Ramirez says, Judge Kavanaugh exposed himself to her. He has denied both allegations.

The backdrop to these complaints was a culture of hard partying that permeated certain quarters of high school and college life in the 1980s, when binge drinking among teenagers had reached record levels. No evidence has emerged to indicate that the episodes of drinking ascribed to Judge Kavanaugh back then carried forward into his professional or family life, or that the handful of F.B.I. background checks he has faced in his official Washington career unearthed any red flags about his drinking as an adult.

But it is his high school and undergraduate years that have proved to be a mine field during his Supreme Court confirmation process, and questions about drinking during that period are expected to come up when he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Judge Kavanaugh himself has provided grist for this line of inquiry through his wistful references to youthful drinking in yearbook entries and speeches over the years, though he has said he never drank so much that he blacked out or could not remember events."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/us/27Drinking1/27Drinking1-facebookJumbo.jpg

Verdict: False.

This week, two distinct — but equally false — rumors spread about links between Judge Kavanaugh’s accusers and George Soros, the liberal billionaire and Democratic megadonor. (Mr. Soros makes frequent appearances in internet conspiracy theories.)

The first claim was that Ms. Ramirez, who lives in Colorado, had received a fellowship in 2013 from the Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization started by Mr. Soros.

In fact, a different Deborah Ramirez — a law professor at Northeastern University in Boston — received a grant from the organization.

Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.

In a remarkable and rambling 83-minute news conference on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Trump was by turns combative, humorous and boastful. He defended Judge Kavanaugh and railed against what he called the “big, fat con job” that he said Democrats were perpetrating to derail the nomination, even as he suggested he could still jettison his pick depending on the outcome of a high-profile hearing on Thursday.

Here are five takeaways from the extraordinary exchange:

The president identifies with a man accused of sexual assault, again.

Mr. Trump stopped short of branding the three women accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault or misconduct as liars, although he did say his nominee faced “false accusations.” He said he was eager to hear the testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Christine Blasey Ford, who has said Judge Kavanaugh assaulted her at a party in the 1980s when both were in high school.

But the president made it clear that he believed his nominee and considered the allegations against the judge as part of a smear campaign hatched by Democrats, not credible charges. In doing so, Mr. Trump, as he has many times in the past, sided with a man accused of sexual misconduct rather than the women making those claims. And he made clear that his penchant for doing so is rooted in being accused of sexual assault himself — he says falsely — and his anger at having to contend with such allegations."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/us/26DC-Takeaways/merlin_144387372_ba018681-1bb4-48ef-a4f6-b4308de1bab9-facebookJumbo.jpg

The Chinese, Mr. Trump claimed, were trying to damage his political standing before the midterm elections because of his imposition of tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese goods. Speaking at the United Nations Security Council, where China’s foreign minister was also present, he said, “They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade.”

It was not the first time the president has accused the Chinese of meddling in the nation’s affairs: He has complained that in response to his tariffs, it had imposed retaliatory ones aimed at American farmers and other politically sensitive constituencies in states that support him. But he has never leveled the accusation so bluntly or in such a high-profile international setting.

Mr. Rosenstein headed to the White House expecting to be fired after the reports. Once there, he asked to meet with Mr. Trump before any decisions were made about his future, according to people briefed on the discussions. He also said that he wanted to leave on amicable terms and did not want to trigger the president’s ire.

The Fed’s decision, announced after a two-day meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, represents the eighth time that the Fed has raised interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis, and the third time this year. Another increase is expected in December.

The Fed described economic conditions as “strong.” It predicted that growth this year could top 3 percent, before slowing in coming years. Unemployment remains low, inflation remains around the 2 percent pace the Fed regards as optimal, and the pace of investment has increased, it said.

For the first time in recent years, the Fed did not describe monetary policy as “accommodative,” indicating that its benchmark interest rate is rising back toward a level the Fed regards as neutral, meaning that monetary policy is neither stimulating nor restraining economic growth.

Mr. Powell emphasized, however, that the change in wording was not intended to signal any change in policy. He said monetary policy remained accommodative at the moment.



A number of Mr. Powell’s colleagues have argued publicly that the Fed most likely needs to raise rates to a level that begins to restrict economic activity. The Fed warned last year that there was no need for a tax cut in the midst of a steady economic expansion. Mr. Trump and Congress ignored that advice, cutting taxes and increasing spending. The result has been a short-term increase in economic growth, which some Fed officials fear could lead to higher inflation."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/business/27dc-fed/27dc-fed-facebookJumbo.jpg

Asked what would happen if the United States moves forward with just Mexico, Mr. Trudeau said: “We will keep working on a broad range of alternatives. A broad range of paths are ahead of us.”

Canadian and American officials have tried to avoid negotiating in public, but in recent days their differences have started to spill out. Speaking at an event sponsored by Politico in Toronto on Wednesday, David MacNaughton, Canada’s ambassador to the United States, said Canada wanted protection from the Trump administration’s use of tariffs on national security grounds.

Upcoming elections in Quebec, a province whose economy is heavily dependent on dairy, have also complicated negotiations for Canada’s leaders as they look to close a deal with the United States.

“It seems like Canada has decided it’s too risky before the Oct. 1 Quebec elections to make any deal on Nafta, so the U.S. and Mexico deal will go forward and get signed, get stuck in the refrigerator,” said Lori Wallach, the director of Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. “Canada and the U.S. will talk and at some point they will all get stirred up and served together in Congress in 2019.”

Canada is the largest export market for America, and members of Congress from both parties have been adamant that it should be included in any agreement with Mexico. Congress must ratify major trade deals, and an agreement that excludes Canada is expected be difficult to pass. There is also an ongoing legal debate as to whether the president has the authority to terminate Nafta on his own. If Nafta is terminated, Canada and Mexico could continue to trade on its terms or work together on their own new free trade agreement."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/25/business/27dc-nafta/27dc-nafta-facebookJumbo.jpg

Some of the world’s oldest structures have survived for 5,000 years in the Orkney Islands.

Off the north coast of Scotland, Orkney’s soft green landscapes hold a trove of things from everyday life before history was written.

More than 3,000 archaeological sites — among them standing stone circles, Norse halls and a Neolithic tomb graffitied by Vikings — have endured for millenniums, scattered across the roughly 70 islands that make up the Orkney archipelago.

At Skara Brae, one of Europe’s best-preserved Stone Age villages, kitchens built around 3180 B.C. are fitted with hearths and cupboards, bedsteads and doors that could be bolted shut.

Today, in forays to remote spits of land, people are working to save some of these places for posterity from the climate changes accelerated by human activity.

Skara Brae.

About half of Orkney’s 3,000 sites, many built before Stonehenge or the pyramids, are under threat from those changes, according to the county archeologist. Some are already being washed away.

Since 1970, Orkney beaches have eroded twice as fast as in the previous century. Others that had been stable are now shrinking. Rains, falling heavier and more often, are dissolving the crusts of soil and sand packs that protect remnants of civilizations.

These threats, now familiar at world heritage sites around the globe, are being answered in Scotland by archaeologists, citizen-scientists, students, government agencies and academics.

Their work is urgent. Orkney’s stories are recorded in disappearing ink.

“Heritage is falling into the sea,” said Prof. Jane Downes, director of the Archaeology Institute at the University of Highlands and Islands. “It’s a very dramatic and obvious sign of sea level rise and increased storminess.”

Note: Archaeological sites date from prehistoric times through the 20th century.

From around the world, troops of archaeologists and students descend in the summers to dig, sift and catalogue imperiled places. There are scrambles for funds. “We’re focused on coastal sites because they’re going to be gone,” Professor Downes said.

At many spots, the only plausible kind of preservation is documentation — done swiftly.

In 1983, an archaeologist drew sketches of a Neolithic chambered tomb at the tip of a peninsula on Sanday island. Then the site was left essentially untouched until last year, when other researchers returned, planning to deploy new tools that would tell them where the people of that area came from and what they ate. But the tomb and its archaeology had shrunk: five feet had been lost to cliff erosion, and it was evident that the remaining 40 feet were headed for the water as well.

Tresness, a Neolithic chambered tomb on Sanday Island.

At the end of the summer digging season, students packed the site with rock and a thick plastic membrane. Depending on the severity of the winter storms, the protection might keep some of the fine sediments from washing away, and also allow another year of excavation at the deteriorating tomb.

In a short walk along the south shore of Rousay Island, a stunning arc of human activity comes into view. One mile covers 50 centuries: the Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. The Picts, the Viking era, rule by the Norse, and Scottish landlords.

Measuring a section of the Knowe of Swandro on Rousay Island.

The burial of a cow on Rousay in 1963 led to the discovery of human graves and, in them, evidence of long-distance travel. For instance, a silver brooch inlaid with amber and gold filigree from about 750 A.D, is similar to Irish jewelry of the era, said Julie Gibson, a lecturer with the University of Highlands and Islands and the co-author, with the photographer Frank Bradford, of “Rising Tides: The Loss of Coastal Heritage in Orkney.”

Nearby, in a Viking cemetery, Ms. Gibson said: “They found two guys buried in boats. One was born north of the Arctic Circle.”

At the Knowe of Swandro, on Rousay, tribes built atop the homes of predecessors, creating layers of habitation back to Neolithic times. One discovery at Swandro this summer was a rock anvil used 1,500 years ago by a Pictish coppersmith, still smudged with the carbon grime of the forge.

Smithy's

handprint 10 centimeters Swandro-Orkney Coastal Archaeology Trust

“You can see where the smithy put his hand and his knee,” said Steve Dockrill, a senior lecturer at the University of Bradford.

The anvil is among the finds that have emerged since 2010, when Julie Bond, an archaeology professor at Bradford, strolling the beach at Swandro, spotted a stone jutting up. She performed a field test. “I gave it a kick,” Professor Bond said. “The kick is an important archaeological tool.”

The Swandro project has a charitable trust to support equipment, tests and housing. Virtually all the Orkney digs rely on donations to supplement thousands of hours of free labor from students. In early August, as professors and students from Bradford, Highlands and Islands, Orkney College, the City University of New York and elsewhere finished their summer fieldwork, they hoped the sites would be there the following year.

Each tide washes away midden, domestic waste heaps, that provide a “cultural and economic biography,” Professor Bond said. “We did core sampling at low tide eight years ago, and you could see settlement materials. When we did it again a couple of years ago, it was gone.”

Warming Planet, Vanishing Heritage How climate change is erasing cultural identity around the world. Part 1 Easter Island Part 2 Cedars of Lebanon

From 2012 to 2016, more than 1,200 volunteers, trained by the Scottish Coastal Heritage at Risk project at the University of St. Andrews, mapped vulnerable sites in Scotland, scores of them on the Orkney and Shetland islands. The report is, in effect, a guide for archaeological triage.

In 2015, a community group on Sanday painstakingly moved a mysterious Stone Age structure known as a burnt mound to a heritage center, away from the shorefront where it was being battered.

Elsewhere, residents are sandbagging an 11th century graveyard to keep skeletons from spilling out. Public agencies are using laser scans to map changes to the beach in front of Skara Brae, where the waters of the Bay of Skaill lap ever closer.

A storm revealed parts of Skara Brae in 1850. To protect the site from the advancing bay, a sea wall was built in 1927. There had been no bay in the village’s Stone Age heyday.

Thanks to the sea wall, Skara Brae remains intact, Ms. Gibson said, in contrast with an unprotected mill a few hundred yards away that has been demolished by tides and storms since 1972. Similarly, the Midhowe Broch, an Iron Age tower on Rousay, has been successfully defended since 1934 by a sea wall. “We’re learning where physical structures can be used for a limited time, and others that can work permanently,” Ms. Gibson said. “Permanently, meaning 100 years.”

Natural changes in climate over the last 15,000 years made human habitation not only possible on the islands, but attractive to succeeding generations. The farmers and fishers put little pressure on the land, other than depleting the timber. Stone was a primary building material. Things lasted.

Midhowe Broch, defended by a sea wall.

With tide and time, most beaches will grow and shrink as the sand and sediment subtracted from one spot are added to another. But nature’s rhythms are being accelerated by human actions.

“Sea level in Orkney has been rising over thousands of years, and so coastal flooding and beach erosion is nothing new,” said Jim Hansom, a professor of geomorphology at the University of Glasgow and principal investigator for Dynamic Coast, a report commissioned by the Scottish government to assess coastal change. “What is of concern is that the extent and pace of erosion since the 1970s has increased.”

Some Orkney beaches have narrowed an average of 16 inches per year since 1970, compared to an annual average loss of eight inches between 1890 and 1970, according to data in Dynamic Coast. In addition, Professor Hansom said, more beaches are eroding.

Rainfall in Northern Scotland increased nearly 26 percent from 1961 to 2011, according to Historic Environment Scotland, the public steward of Scotland’s historic sites, which has studied risks to Scottish heritage from climate shifts. “The changes have speeded up,” said Mairi Davies, climate change manager for the agency. They are, she said, significantly faster than at any other point in the last 100 years.

The new extremes have led to archaeological epiphanies.

Walking across Cata Sand on the island of Sanday on a windy December day in 2015, Professor Downes and colleagues noticed an upright stone and red soil that turned out to be hearth scrapings. They found an early Neolithic house, older than those at Skara Brae.

A small dune had protected the site for thousands of years. But a storm in 2012 ripped the dune away. The next one may erase the Stone Age house.

With students and archaeologists from her own school and the University of Central Lancashire, Professor Downes has spent the last three summers digging between tides and documenting the artifacts.

The waters and storms that exposed these sites will also, before long, destroy them. The coastal survey forecasts that Cata Sand will lose about 80 feet of beach by 2050.

“That’s why this site is so important in trying to understand the lives of past societies,” Ross Drummond, a student at the University of Highlands and Islands, said. “The archaeology will be washed away for good, and future generations will only have our records and findings to go on to understand the story of Cata.”

In 1999, a few Orkney treasures were listed as world heritage monuments by Unesco, which said the islands had been a “center of innovation and experimentation” in art and architecture that spread throughout the Neolithic world. Among them is Maeshowe, a passage tomb built in 3000 B.C. Its entryway aligns with the setting midwinter sun, much like a tomb at Newgrange, 500 miles south in Ireland. (More than 4,000 years after Maeshowe was built, Vikings broke in and carved runes on the walls. A fit-to-print graffito roughly translates as: “Thorfinn wrote these runes.”)

The most sprawling neolithic Orkney site, the Ness of Brodgar, is only now emerging on a neck of land surrounded by water. Its discovery was pure serendipity.

The Ness of Brodgar.

In 2003, a couple hired a farmer to plow a sheep field outside their retirement home to ready the ground for a wildflower meadow. On the final turn, he hit a stone — one that had notches carved into it. The stone was part of a group of monumentally scaled structures, all buried.

Near them was an impossibly massive wall, also buried, 18 feet thick in places. Until then, the area’s landscape had been dominated by two circles of standing stones, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness (they appear on the album cover of Van Morrison’s “The Philosopher’s Stone”).

The Ness totals six acres, about eight American football fields, and is rich with artwork and heaps of cattle bone from mass feasts, said Nick Card, director of the site. With less than 10 percent excavated, he said, 35,000 items have been collected.

Archaeologists and students trowel the soil, whisk dirt off promising bits, then bag them.

Ongoing work at the Ness of Brodgar.

“I thought you’d have to be really lucky to find anything,” Kaehlin Terry, 22, a senior from Willamette University in Oregon, said. “But every 20 seconds, you come up with pieces of bone, stone tools, pottery.”

Across vast historical ages, ordinary time scales blur.

The grand spaces at the Ness of Brodgar, like the homely kitchens of Skara Brae and the tomb at Maeshowe, were built thousands of years before scribes first told of Buddha and Moses, Lord Vishnu and Jesus Christ.

But he could no longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.

“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” Mr. McCullough said. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”

What had thrown his affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, Mr. McCullough received around $900 every month to supplement the roughly $650 a month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.

It was not just that he now received roughly $50 less a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut — the cost of a week’s groceries — was painful. (Others have experienced worse: The average working family has lost more than $100 a month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)

What really hurt Mr. McCullough was how that loss was compounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.

Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment, a dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In Mr. McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.

By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/world/27child-poverty-p1/xxchild-poverty1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg

Outlining a “radical plan to rebuild and transform” Britain, Mr. Corbyn underscored his ambition to shift economic policy leftward — a position that he described as the “new common sense of our time” after a decade of stagnating wages and squeezed living standards.

In a speech intended to present him as a prime minister in waiting, Mr. Corbyn said that it would be a “national disaster” if Britain quit the European Union without a deal. If Prime Minister Theresa May cannot negotiate a satisfactory withdrawal agreement, he said, she should “make way for a party that can and will.”

This is precisely why the Senate needs to stop trying to ram through this nomination by some arbitrary deadline and arrange for a thorough and nonpartisan inquiry.

Unlike Christine Blasey Ford or Deborah Ramirez, Ms. Swetnick is not claiming to have been assaulted directly by Judge Kavanaugh. But her accusations directly speak to his repeated insistence that he never behaved in a demeaning or disrespectful manner toward women. In his recent interview on Fox News, the nominee, seated primly beside his wife, presented his teenage self as a virtual choir boy, chastely focused on academics and sports and weekly church attendance. The nominee even said that he remained a virgin throughout high school and “for many years thereafter.”

That was a risky defense, and Judge Kavanaugh seems to be reconsidering it. In an opening statement prepared for him to deliver at his appearance before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, the nominee now allows that he was “not perfect” in high school. He admits that he may have drank too much on occasion (though rarely on school nights) and that he may have said and done things that now make him “cringe.”

Yet he maintains that it is inconceivable that he would have sexually wronged anyone at any time. And he fiercely brushes aside all of the accusations to arise after Dr. Blasey came forward as part of plot against him. “Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired,” his prepared statement says. “There has been a frenzy to come up with something — anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious — that will block a vote on my nomination. These are last-minute smears, pure and simple.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/opinion/26edtWEb/26edtWEb-facebookJumbo.jpg
2f14d5f3b91e461fb48e2cbba0839431	[]	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Opinion | Brett Kavanaugh and America’s ‘Himpathy’ Reckoning	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | Brett Kavanaugh and America’s ‘Himpathy’ Reckoning	1	"Once you learn to spot himpathy, it becomes difficult not to see it everywhere: in men such as the former editor of The New York Review of Books Ian Buruma, who published a self-indulgent essay by a former Canadian talk-show host accused of sexual assault and harassment by more than 20 women; in women like the five Republicans whom CNN convened recently to voice support for Judge Kavanaugh (“Tell me, what boy hasn’t done this in high school?” asked one, shrugging himpathetically). But we’re in a moment during which himpathy is so thoroughly on display, in such a public way, that the time is ripe to push for a mass moral reckoning.

What the Kavanaugh case has revealed this week is that himpathy can, at its most extreme, become full-blown gendered sociopathy: a pathological moral tendency to feel sorry exclusively for the alleged male perpetrator — it was too long ago; he was just a boy; it was a case of mistaken identity — while relentlessly casting suspicion upon the female accusers. It also reveals the far-ranging repercussions of this worldview: It’s no coincidence that many of those who himpathize with Judge Kavanaugh to the exclusion of Dr. Blasey are also avid abortion opponents, a position that requires a refusal to empathize with girls and women facing an unwanted pregnancy.

What makes himpathy so difficult to counter is that the mechanisms underlying it are partly moral in nature: Sympathy and empathy are pro-social moral emotions, which makes it especially hard to convince people that when they skew toward the powerful and against the vulnerable, they become a source of systemic injustice. So, for those for whom himpathy is a mental habit prompted by biased social forces, and not an entrenched moral outlook, the first step to solving the problem is simply learning to recognize when it’s at work, and to be wary of its biasing influence.

The second step to solving the problem of himpathy is listening to girls and women. Do you wonder why someone might not come forward to report sexual assault as an adolescent girl? Listen to Dr. Blasey, who told The Washington Post that at the time she was terrified that she would be in trouble if her parents realized she had been at a party where teenagers were drinking. She recalled thinking: “I’m not ever telling anyone this. This is nothing, it didn’t happen, and he didn’t rape me.” It wasn’t until years later, with the help of a therapist, that she emerged from this denial and recognized the episode as traumatic.

In other words, like many women, Dr. Blasey needed a long time to break a silence born out of society’s entrenched deference to privileged men. It’s a deference that Mr. Trump and Judge Kavanaugh’s other supporters are now demonstrating vividly.

The T.V.A. — which is not to be confused with the people who generate electricity in the Tennessee Valley — was a joke my friends and I made up early in our college careers. It referred to the then-popular idea that girls could go as far as they wanted with a boy as long as everything stayed, um, intact.

All of this brings us to Brett Kavanaugh, who appears to have been a T.V.A. member.

“Never had sexual intercourse with anyone in high school?” asked a Fox interviewer. “Correct,” said a somber Supreme Court nominee, who added that he had maintained that record for “many years after.”

Except maybe not.

“Perhaps Brett Kavanaugh was a virgin for many years after high school. But he claimed otherwise in a conversation with me during our freshman year in Lawrance Hall at Yale, in the living room of my suite,” tweeted a history professor at the University of Wisconsin.

Three women — Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick — are now accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct as a teenager and young adult. The allegations include assault, attempted rape and, now, that he and other boys attempted “to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so that they could then be ‘gang raped’ in a side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys.”

Swetnick, the latest accuser, described Kavanaugh as a “mean drunk.”

This is explosive, extraordinary stuff.

However, Kavanaugh has categorically denied that any of this ever happened.

In an interview on Fox News, Kavanaugh said that he had always “treated women with dignity and respect” and that he “did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter.”

I must say that I found his specification of sexual “intercourse” interesting here. First, sexual assault doesn’t require intercourse. Second, one can be sexually intimate — or sexually violated — without intercourse.

At first blush, Mr. Trump’s second appearance at the United Nations General Assembly may have seemed like more self-congratulatory bluster, nationalist isolationism and rote genuflection to the altar of sovereignty — much like last year. But this time, Americans suffered the added humiliation of watching the world burst out laughing at their president, whose false bravado no longer induces shock but invites derision.

Given this drama, it’s easy to mistake Mr. Trump’s visit for a mash-up of meetings and muddled messages. But careful observers should not be diverted from discerning the president’s real purpose at the United Nations, because it is ominous.

On four critical policy fronts, President Trump foreshadowed his intention to ignore our greatest threats and to stoke fresh conflict where it is neither necessary nor wise. More telling than his rabidly ideological speech to the General Assembly was the president’s more substantive remarks before the Security Council on Wednesday. And by now we have ample reason to conclude that Mr. Trump generally means what he says and (eventually) does much of what he threatens.

First, President Trump doubled down on his determination to exonerate Russia and minimize the serious threat that it poses to us and our allies. In a Security Council session devoted to the preventing the proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, Mr. Trump ignored Russia’s recent attack with a deadly nerve agent that severely sickened four people in Britain and may have killed one other. He neglected to name Russia as the principal violator of United Nations sanctions on North Korea. And he failed to condemn Russia’s repeated lies to cover for Syria’s use of chemical weapons."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/opinion/26riceWeb/26riceWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg

At least eight million Yemenis are at risk of starvation from an approaching famine caused not by crop failures but by our actions and those of our allies.

An American bomb made by Lockheed Martin struck a Yemen school bus last month, killing 51 people. Earlier, American bombs killed 155 mourners at a funeral and 97 people at a market.

Wade, a precedent that he then voted, in dissent, to repudiate when the opportunity arose during his first year on the Supreme Court bench.

It matters that the man who is now the court’s senior associate justice, and who would turn the constitutional clock back to the 18th century if he ever found four colleagues to agree with him, distanced himself during his confirmation hearing from the extreme conservative views he had spent years espousing in speeches. Those were, he claimed, nothing more than the musings of a “part-time political theorist.” Pressed to explain his position that there was a “natural law” higher than the Constitution, he uttered perhaps the most candid line of the entire proceeding: “I certainly never thought I’d be having this discussion.”

And I’d like to think that people remember his remarkable description of the transformation he underwent when he became a judge and “shed the baggage of ideology.” It was an “amazing process,” he told the senators. “You want to be stripped down like a runner.”

In one way, Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court nominee is Clarence Thomas’s opposite. His conventional qualifications are not in doubt. (The American Bar Association committee that deemed him “well qualified,” the organization’s highest rating, had adjudged Clarence Thomas to be only “qualified,” with a minority of the members deeming him “unqualified.”) After a Supreme Court clerkship and 12 years on the federal appellate bench, he has an easy familiarity with the intricacies of the Supreme Court’s docket. His avoidance of direct questions about his substantive views was graceful to the point of tedium, and not a surprise to anyone.

So what should the public remember from the “real” Brett Kavanaugh hearing? Again, to be clear, I don’t mean to minimize the importance of the hearing scheduled for Thursday. My concern is that the vulnerabilities that have come to light in recent days — not only Dr. Blasey’s precise allegation of sexual assault but also tales of the nominee’s heavy drinking in high school and beyond, his disturbingly suggestive yearbook entry , and his buddy who could say a lot but who chooses not to talk — collectively have already started to drown out the vulnerabilities that should have made the nomination something other than the partisan glide path to confirmation that it was on when the first-round hearing ended."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/opinion/26greenhouseWeb/26greenhouseWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg

Despite the advent of antibiotics, tuberculosis had remained endemic in parts of the country. Those miracle drugs were good at curing individual cases of TB, but people could pass the disease on to others long before they developed obvious symptoms, received proper diagnoses or were effectively cured.

But when Mr. Comstock looked at data from rural Alaska, where 30 percent of adults were still infected with the disease nearly a decade after a cure became widely available, he saw a path forward: Antibiotics could eradicate tuberculosis, but only if they were given to people before they became contagious. In other words, doctors couldn’t just treat the people who were visibly sick. They would have to test all of the people that person came into contact with, and treat the ones who tested positive — even if they didn’t have symptoms yet. That way, the bacteria that caused the disease would be killed before it had a chance to spread.

In richer countries like the United States, Britain and Canada, that strategy has long since become a norm of public health. It’s helped eradicate TB from all but the poorest quarters — and, in some cases, even from there. And it’s kept some serious outbreaks from becoming epidemics. In poor countries, though, the approach has been deemed impractical. Tracking down all of a given patient’s contacts is difficult in the best of circumstances, the thinking goes, and resources are scarce enough that giving drugs to people who are not yet sick sounds extravagant.

And so, tuberculosis remains the world’s leading infectious disease killer, by far. It infects some 10 million people around the world every year, killing roughly 1.5 million . That’s some 4,000 deaths per day. By comparison, Ebola killed four people in 2017. America’s opioid epidemic kills about 115 people a day."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/opinion/26TB/26TB-facebookJumbo.jpg

And Wright was not a particularly credible witness. Even Mayer and Abramson conceded that “her files contained ample ammunition for anyone trying to embarrass her,” including a checkered workplace history in which she was fired by a congressman’s office, resigned from a State Department job and immediately accused her boss of racism, and then was fired by Thomas himself for poor performance, after which she reportedly told a friend that she was “pissed” and wanted “to get him back.”

Which doesn’t mean that she was necessarily lying when she claimed Thomas had made persistent and sometimes lewd advances; it just means that she was not some slam-dunk, Hill-vindicating witness, but someone whose testimony would have raised lots of reasonable doubts.

The same problems attach to other testimonies. When Abramson revisited the Thomas case earlier this year for New York Magazine, she pointed to two other female witnesses who could confirm Thomas’s penchant for inappropriate remarks. But one’s account surfaced secondhand, and the witness herself immediately issued a statement that “she never experienced any type of inappropriate behavior.” The other, Thomas’s girlfriend at the time of the Hill case, offered her stories — which were mostly about general lasciviousness rather than harassment — nearly two decades later while shopping a memoir and expressing irritation with Thomas’s conservative record on the bench.

But does all of this add up to a clear vindication of Thomas? No, I don’t think so. There were weaknesses in Hill’s testimony but no clear motive for such a dramatic fabrication, Mayer and Abramson found witnesses from Thomas’s workplace who had heard about the famous “pubic hair on a Coke” can line that he denied uttering, there was plausible testimony as well hearsay that he had a pornography habit of some sort … I could go on.

My own sense, when I wade back into the “he said, she said” detail, is that neither of their testimonies were entirely believable, and that there’s some missing piece of the story that may never come to light. But that’s pure supposition, rather than something that I would stake myself to with any sort of certainty.

And the importance of uncertainty is what this excursion into the 1990s should convey. If you are a partisan, an activist, a politics obsessive, any certainty you feel about Brett Kavanaugh right now is probably too strong. And any mystification or bafflement or anger that you feel about someone else’s certainty — how it simply must be cynical, manufactured, malign — should be tempered by a recognition that your own certainty might have to be revised 20 years from now, that how you read the evidence in the heat of a polarized moment might not be the only way to read it, and that not every historical controversy or scandal gets settled cleanly or wrapped up in a neat moralistic bow.

Again, I apologize for the lecturing tone. Now back to your corners for the hearings.

48cae0f757cd41c6a05fa5d218530921	[]	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Opinion | The Amazon on the Brink	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | The Amazon on the Brink	1	"In an analysis published in July in the journal Nature Climate Change, 10 Brazilian scientists concluded that “the abandonment of deforestation control policies and the political support for predatory agricultural practices” will make it impossible for Brazil to to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the level the country promised in Paris. Continued weak environmental governance, the scientists warned, could lead to the loss of up to 17,000 square miles of rain forest a year, endangering the entire Amazon ecosystem.

Why this change in policy? The scientists put it succinctly: “In exchange for political support, the Brazilian government is signaling landholders to increase deforestation.”

President Temer’s minister of justice is pushing plans to allow agribusiness to rent indigenous land that had been off limits to developers. Other proposals would effectively freeze the creation of new protected areas, open others to resource exploitation and block the mapping of boundaries of indigenous lands, potentially opening native communities and their forests to invasion by miners and ranchers.

Indigenous territories contain more forest than all of the government’s conservation units combined, and historically Brazil’s native peoples have been far more effective in defending the rain forest than the government or private landowners.

The anti-environment agenda is being pushed by of a coalition of large landowners and agribusinesses in Congress (the “bancada ruralista” or so-called ruralists). Regular revelations of corruption involving government ministers, legislators — and also, President Temer himself — have provided them with cover to pursue regressive measures, like a proposed constitutional amendment that would prevent Brazil’s regulators from blocking environmentally unsound road and development projects.

Scores of such projects planned for inaccessible regions of the Amazon may be fast-tracked should the amendment pass and the environmental review process is gutted as a result, as now seems likely. For example, the 540-mile long BR-319 highway would, if completed, open a vast area in the central and northern Amazonia to deforestation.

Not only is little being done to prevent illegal land use, some laws have encouraged it. Last year, the “ grileiro” or land-grabber, law legalized tracts of nearly 6,200 acres that were taken illegally — a boon to land speculators and others who seize public lands for their own use."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/opinion/26Schiffman1/26Schiffman1-facebookJumbo.jpg

By Kim Tingley

A modern building of cedar, stone, steel and glass, set in a wooded sanctuary, houses the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, N.Y. On a wet morning in August, I visited the office of Mike Webster, the director of the lab’s Macaulay Library, home to one of the most comprehensive collections of natural-sound recordings in the world. Webster is a biologist who studies sexual selection and mating behavior in wild birds, and that includes the question of how their songs evolve. Decoding birdcalls and songs has always been a crucial component of ornithological research, but scientists are also increasingly analyzing the acoustics of many other species as a way to measure their health and that of their habitats. “The Macaulay ‘Library’ is not a real good name,” Webster told me. “A better way of thinking about what we are is as a biological research collection or museum. In most places, you have skins and bones. Specimens capture traits over time. But traits that are not captured are behavior. So we’re like a collection of behavior.”



As Webster searched the Macaulay database for samples to play, it struck me that I had so far considered him and his lab only visually: I’d noticed the striking architecture, all the trees, the slate-colored sky, along with his beard, his plaid shirt and the friendly-seeming crinkles around his eyes. And though the pitter-pat of the rain and the tone of Webster’s voice undoubtedly shaded those impressions, I was not aware of their doing so. Nor, if I had been, would I have had much of a vocabulary to translate those sounds into print. Part of the reason for this is straightforward biology: As primates, we tend to see better than we hear. Culturally, a preponderance of visual communications (street signs, books, body language, Tinder) reinforce this preference for sight. But another, more complicated reason has to do with what sound is and is not.

“I can play a heartbreaking one for you,” I heard Webster say, followed by a click. Consider that “click,” remarkable in its onomatopoetic ordinariness. We know instantly where it came from: Webster’s mouse. Or did it? Depending on your philosophical bent, it could have also come from his finger, or the movement of his finger against the mouse, or a burst of energy traveling outward from the mouse through the air in waves, or from the vibration of the drums in Webster’s and my ears in a manner our brains registered as “click.” It could have originated as all of these; in that case, is it still a finite unit from inception through reception? Defining that “click” — invisible, temporary, a byproduct of an event that ended the moment it began — prompts us to re-examine our concept of reality in a way that looking does not. “This is what sound is,” Michel Chion, a French composer and filmmaker, writes in “Sound: An Acoulogical Treatise,” “this coming and going where something has moved in the meantime, between the coming and the going.” In short, sound is, by its very nature, not an object but a journey through space and time.

Paradoxically, the photographs on the following pages, accompanied by recordings, are fixed. They are defined by the page, whereas sound has no similar boundary. We see them in the present tense, but we listen (always, but doubly so with recordings) to the past. What, then, can a picture tell us about a sound — what can looking teach us about listening — and vice versa? One answer is that the evanescence of sound underscores the inevitability of loss and, in turn, deepens our capacity to appreciate what is beautiful — to be surprised.

Click. Strains of discrete, flutelike notes filled the room. I heard them as playful, cheerful, until Webster explained that they were the voice of a long-dead bird, captured on tape back in 1976. “Kauai Oo,” Webster said between calls, naming the extinct Hawaiian species, whose mating pairs duetted. “This is the last one ever recorded. He’s waiting for someone to respond.”

Humans are a visual species except, crucially, at our beginning and end. “In terms of development, hearing is one of the first things that turns on,” Aaron Rice, a bioacoustics researcher at Cornell, pointed out, referring to our time in the womb, when, at about 15 weeks, we begin to develop the ability to hear the swishing, thumping cacophony of our mother’s body. “They tell emergency medical services to always keep talking to a victim, because hearing is the last thing to turn off.” Our middle ears and those of countless other creatures originated as the gill- and jawbones of fish and help us balance ourselves. Below 20 hertz, we stop hearing a sound and start feeling it as vibration. “Hearing is a way of touching at a distance,” the Canadian composer and environmentalist R. Murray Schafer writes in “The Tuning of the World,” “and the intimacy of the first sense is fused with sociability whenever people gather together to hear something special.” Eons ago, as early mammals grappled with the challenges of finding insects among the foliage of dimly lit forests, they evolved large, front-facing eyes and bigger brains, which eventually led to the dependence on sight for orientation and communication among modern humans and other primates. Storytelling, though, remained an oral tradition in the West until the advent of the printing press in the 15th century. Over the next 400 years or so, the eye gained an advantage as a collector, retainer and disseminator of information. Then the arrival of Thomas Edison’s phonograph offered a widespread way to record and play back sound.

As audio recording gradually improved, musicians were among the earliest to appreciate what this new technology could reveal about the natural world. In the 1990s, Bernie Krause, a soundscape ecologist and former professional musician, put forward the hypothesis, now generally accepted, that each creature in a given soundscape occupies an “acoustic niche,” a finite bandwidth at a certain frequency and time of day or night, ensuring that it can be heard. By comparing spectograms — visualizations of sound — of recordings he made at various sites over years and even decades, he began to show that masking an animal’s bandwidth with human noise could be tantamount to bulldozing its physical habitat. Around the same time, Christopher W. Clark, whose musical background included training as a choirboy, founded a bioacoustics laboratory at Cornell and enlisted colleagues there in linguistics, engineering, anthropology and other disciplines to help him develop a language to describe the ineffable qualities of music and the recordings that biologists were bringing back from the field, some of which were inaudible to the naked ear. “Mayflies stridulating on a weed stem sounds like jug band,” Clark says. “Speed up the blue whale’s song 60 times, and you hear the rhythm.” Perhaps the greatest value of eavesdropping on these previously unheard utterances, Clark and other bioacousticians felt, was the chance it offered people who were neither scientists nor musicians to connect with other beings. “The biology of sound in land, sea and skies, the magnificence of the living symphony — everybody gets it in terms of music,” he says.

Though our ears, unlike our eyes, are open at all times, we often fail to perceive consciously what we hear. In the 1960s, Schafer urged university students in an experimental-music class he was teaching to notice “the sounds of their own environment and the sounds they themselves inject into their environment” — voices, breath, the rustling of fabric, the scratching of a pencil. He gave them “ear cleaning” assignments: Write down everything you hear; try to find silence; tape a conversation, replay it and note sounds you did not intentionally record. “Before we train a surgeon to perform delicate operations, we first ask him to get into the habit of washing his hands,” he pointed out. “Ears also perform delicate operations, and therefore ear cleanliness is an important prerequisite for all music listening and music playing.” Greater acoustic awareness, however, comes at a price. Go to the most peaceful place you can think of, and try Schafer’s exercises; odds are it will never seem quite as peaceful again. And in fact, a collaborative study by the Natural Sounds and Night Skies division of the National Park Service has documented that human-made noise has doubled the background sound-level volume in more than half of its protected areas, disrupting wildlife and detracting from the experience of visitors — who are, of course, making much of that noise themselves.

In humans, prolonged exposure to noise has been linked with cardiovascular problems, heightened stress levels, decreased immune-system function and cognitive impairments, as well as feelings of helplessness that are a risk factor for depression. Researchers have also found that what we hear changes what we see. People who look at photos of national-park vistas while listening to natural sound rate them significantly higher in terms of “scenic beauty,” “freedom,” “tranquillity” and such qualities than they do when the same images are paired with noise from motorcycles, snowmobiles or plane propellers, according to a joint study by Colorado State University, Penn State University and the natural-sounds division. Even so, we continue to elevate landscapes at the expense of soundscapes: To wit, motorcycles, snowmobiles and planes are vehicles that national-park visitors use to sightsee; onboard, those visitors are unable to hear a thing outside their own acoustic bubbles.

Recently, I sought advice from Davyd Betchkal, a soundscape technician and biologist with the natural-sounds division for the Alaska region: What insights could readers could hope to glean from a photography issue devoted to hearing? He directed me to Chion and his fellow filmmaker Walter Murch, specifically to a remark by Murch published in 2005: “You have to invoke the possibility of the sound. You can’t simply be silent and say, ‘This silence is great’; instead, you have to imagine the hundred musicians onstage in order for their silence to mean anything. You have to work with the psychic pressure exerted by the instruments or sounds that are not playing. This is the underpinning of what I try to do with sound, which is to evoke the individual imagination of each member of the audience.”

The potential of those musicians — or volcanoes, or bats, or sand dunes — can be conjured with a photograph. But with the development of recording devices capable of operating by themselves in the field for weeks and even months at a stretch, researchers have also begun to capture sounds whose origin is completely unknown, and thus for which not even a mental image exists. At Cornell, Holger Klinck, the director of the ornithology lab’s bioacoustics research program, played me recordings he made in Antarctica. “You’re standing on the ice, a flat sheet of ice, everything is white or blue, there’s nothing going on, maybe a few penguins,” he told me. “Put the hydrophone in the water, and you think you’re in a freaking jungle.” Many of the sounds — the laser-gun-like glissandos of the Weddell seal; the drumroll-to-static collision of two icebergs — have been identified. Others — an elephantine bellow, a guttural moaning, a sustained foghorn — remain a mystery. These sounds in particular, out of context and untethered to images, create a unique version of the “psychic pressure” Murch describes: a visceral sense of the physical power required to bring them about and, in the formlessness of that power, an awareness of the vast scale at which so much else has come and gone, and continues to come and go, without our notice.

Recording offers ecologists and others a chance to preserve pristine acoustic environments for posterity — and make the public case for saving them from extinction. The idea for the Macaulay Library came in the late 1920s, with the emergence of talking films, a medium that invented novel techniques for artificially coupling images and sounds to elicit emotion. Until then, Murch has written, sounds “seemed to be the inevitable and ‘accidental’ (and therefore mostly ignored) accompaniment of the visual — stuck like a shadow to the object that caused them. ... Recording magically lifted the shadow away from the object and stood it on its own.”

Early reel-to-reel recorders weighed upward of 15 pounds, and because each reel lasted 30 minutes at most, a biologist had to lug mountains of tape into the field too. Advances in technology have significantly decreased the size of recording equipment while exponentially increasing the amount of data they can store; the challenge for bioacoustics researchers now is analyzing the vast quantities of sound they can capture. They are also seeking ways to use that information in real time. For instance, Cornell has buoys in Massachusetts Bay that record underwater 24/7 and process that data automatically; if they detect the acoustic signature of an endangered right whale, they alert an analyst at the lab who can post a warning for nearby ships, say, to slow down, warding off potentially fatal collisions.

But the magic trick that the Macaulay’s natural-sound recordings perform, of asking us to consider what we hear in our surroundings independently of what we see, has existential implications for us all. Eleanor Ratcliffe, an environmental psychologist at Imperial College London who has shown that people perceive bird song as having restorative effects, told me that her subjects often shared anecdotes of bird song in which the sound seemed to color the passage of time, connecting them to memories of growing up and important life events. Jacob Job, a recordist for the park service’s natural-sounds division, told me that when park visitors see him out with his parabolic-dish microphone, they frequently ask what he’s doing. When he explains that he’s making “an acoustical snapshot” (a mixed metaphor that signals the complex relationship between sight and sound and memory), they almost always respond with descriptions of sounds from their own lives. Sound, he said, “evokes emotion and memory so well.”

Indeed, not long after speaking with him, on a visit to my Florida hometown, a friend and I were reminiscing about a hurricane that hit there in August 2004. The storm knocked the power out for days — even weeks, in some spots: Refrigerators ceased humming; radios, televisions and air-conditioners fell silent. It took a while for people to acquire generators, and for that first night, at least, we were quiet and exposed. The sound of the place we had always lived in permeated our dark homes: a cacophonous chirping and trilling so intense it seemed impossible that we had been oblivious to it before and would become so again as soon as our appliances came back to life. In our memories, the strangeness of that soundscape defines the event — frightening, magnificent — and lends its chaos meaning: We were able, in the absence of our own noise, to hear how mighty and resilient life on our planet is, how vulnerable and temporary we are."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/23/magazine/23mag-Lava-image-slide-VWYB/23mag-Lava-image-slide-VWYB-facebookJumbo.jpg

While working on “Ninth Street Women: Lee Krasner, Elaine de Kooning, Grace Hartigan, Joan Mitchell, and Helen Frankenthaler: Five Painters and the Movement That Changed Modern Art,” Gabriel sensed the “irony of writing about these characters as ‘women artists,’” when they themselves refused “to be characterized as such.” As Elaine de Kooning put it in 1971, in a pointed rebuke to the budding field of feminist art history, “To be put in any category not defined by one’s work is to be falsified.”

Too bad for de Kooning, but luckily for us, Gabriel has declined to take such extreme pronouncements as the last word. “Ninth Street Women” is supremely gratifying, generous and lush but also tough and precise — in other words, as complicated and capacious as the lives it depicts. The story of New York’s postwar art world has been told many times over, but by wresting the perspective from the boozy, macho brawlers who tended to fixate on themselves and one another, Gabriel has found a way to newly illuminate the milieu and upend its clichés.

The title comes from the Ninth Street Show of 1951, which brought together a raucous and rivalrous art scene for one short month. “Nothing sold,” Gabriel writes, “but no one cared.” The event established New York as a confident and worthy successor to a war-wrecked Paris, showcasing 72 artists whose styles may have differed but whose mutual influence was palpable. Names that were then known mainly to other artists and curators — Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Robert Rauschenberg — would soon become the mainstays of museum collections and art history textbooks."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/books/27bookgabriel3/27bookgabriel3-facebookJumbo.jpg

The critics’ worry for Apple is understandable, even if their repeated wrongness is a little hilarious. Apple’s two-decade ascent from a near-bankrupt has-been of the personal computer era into the first trillion-dollar corporation has defied every apparent rule in tech.

Companies that make high-priced hardware products aren’t supposed to be as popular, as profitable or as permanent. To a lot of people in tech, Apple’s success can seem like a fluke, and every new hurdle the company has faced — the rise of Android, the death of Steve Jobs, the saturation of the smartphone market, the ascendance of artificial intelligence and cloud software — has looked certain to do it in.

But this year, as it begins to roll out a new set of iPhones, the story line surrounding Apple has improbably shifted. In an era of growing skepticism about the tech industry’s impact on society, Apple’s business model is turning out to be its most lasting advantage."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/business/26STATE/26STATE-facebookJumbo.jpg

There are two steps to the process, which as Mr. Peternell points out can lead to endless improvisation. First, season the chicken and brown it well in a pan. Salt, pepper and flour are what’s called for in this basic recipe, but adding some paprika would be a delicious option, or some cumin, coriander, paprika and a dash of cinnamon and caraway for a scent of Morocco. Then, braise it in liquid — white wine for the classic, red wine for a coq-au-vin feel, or with beer, chicken stock or plain water. Mr. Peternell does his braising in the oven, but you could easily do it on the stovetop as well, simmering the chicken slowly beneath a lid. Pair with rice or boiled potatoes, with couscous, with big hunks of garlic bread.

It should go without saying that different ingredients cook at different times. Start with the slowest-cooking ingredient, then add items in a progression, ending with whatever cooks fastest.

So does cut. The smaller an ingredient is chopped, the faster it will cook. This applies only to like ingredients: Small chunks of carrots may still take longer to cook through than larger pieces of tomatoes, mushrooms, broccoli or other less dense vegetables. Half an inch is a good starting point, cooking quickly while providing a satisfying bite.

Pay attention to placement, both of your sheet pan and your ingredients. The closer the sheet pan is to the heat source, the crisper and browner everything will get. Similarly, ingredients at the pan’s edges cook faster than those in the middle. (Take note, too, that the more spread out the ingredients are, the more air will flow between them, browning them further.) For even cooking, place larger pieces at the edges and smaller pieces in the center, and make sure to rotate your sheet pan halfway through cooking.

Mind your temperature. The suggested cook times listed here are based on a 400-degree oven temperature, but choose a hotter temperature for deeper color and a juicy center, and a lower temperature for slower, more even cooking. You can also run quick-cooking ingredients under the broiler for a meal in minutes. It’s also worth noting that a higher temperature browns food faster, so you’ll want to keep a more careful watch. Setting the temperature a little lower gives you more wiggle room."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/24/dining/24sheetpan19/24sheetpan19-superJumbo.jpg
c82ae35c1e9444b2933cc2e603adab4a	['Melissa Clark', 'A Guide', 'Sam Sifton', 'Mark Bittman', 'Jonathan Reynolds', 'Kim Severson']		How to Use an Instant Pot	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	How to Use an Instant Pot	1	"Crunchy, Browned Food: Any place you’d want to have crunch or crispness, like the delectable fried chicken above (our guide can help you with that) – unless you plan to broil or fry after cooking in the pot. For example, you can cook pork ribs in the pot until they’re falling apart tender, then broil them to crisp the edges.

Quick Sautéed Food: Anything that you can sauté in a pan on the stovetop in under 15 minutes (small pieces of meat like cutlets, delicate vegetables and fruits, certain egg dishes, pasta) will do better on the stove – particularly if you are looking for browning or caramelization. You also won’t save any time, even if you’re using the pressure cooking setting. By the time you bring everything up to pressure, allow for the cooking time and then release the pressure, it will probably take at least 15 minutes. So if you can do it faster and better on the stove, you might as well.

Rare Steaks and Other Meats: Save these for the grill, a cast-iron pan on the stove top, or the broiler.

Fish and Seafood: Because they can go from done to overdone in a matter of seconds, most fish and seafood do better using methods other than the pressure setting. You can get a great result from pressure cooking, but your margin of error is pretty small. Always follow the recipe exactly for the first time when cooking fish, or err on the side of less time. Generally, low pressure is sufficient, rather than using high pressure. Slow cooking, on the other hand, can work really well with fish and seafood, especially for seafood stews, braises, and steamed mussels and other bivalves.

Pasta: You can cook pasta in the multicooker, but it’s not nearly as intuitive or easy as boiling it on the stove. Pasta casseroles and lasagnas can work, but they will not brown on top unless you transfer them to the oven, and the sauces will not condense and deepen in flavor.

Cakes and Other Pastries: Most cakes taste better, and will rise better when baked in the oven. This is because the multicooker steams rather than bakes them. The notable exceptions are cheesecake, delicate custards and puddings. They cook well in the multicooker’s moist environment, without the need to set up a Bain-Marie as you would in an oven. When cooking under pressure, use low pressure for custards and puddings to ensure the mixture doesn’t curdle. Hardier cheesecakes can stand up to high pressure. When using the slow cooker function, keep an eye on the water level so it doesn’t evaporate before the custard is set. It can take a while."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/27/dining/27INSTAPOT1/27INSTAPOT1-superJumbo.jpg

The rule for cooking with wine also applies to cheese: Don’t cook with anything you wouldn’t want to drink or eat on its own. On average, you’ll need a pound and a half to two pounds of cheese per pound of pasta. But the type of cheese can vary depending on the style of macaroni and cheese you are making and your preferred flavors and textures.

Cheddar reigns here, somehow always behaving exactly as it should. It melts wonderfully, never breaking or becoming greasy, with just the right amount of salt and tang. Sharp, extra sharp and sharp white are best.

To bolster flavor, adding a touch of something a bit more assertive like fontina or Gruyère is excellent, but be sure that at least half of the cheese used is Cheddar. Fontina and Gruyère are richer and fattier and could cause a sauce to break if used on their own. Avoid ultra mild cheeses like Monterey Jack or Colby: While they are fine for melting, they lack the salt or tang to make them worth your while.

A bit of Parmesan or pecorino (up to an additional 1/4 cup grated) can always be added for deeper flavor and saltiness, but too much and the sauce could become grainy.

Whatever cheese you use, it’s always best to grate from a block rather than buying pre-grated cheese (which can contain additives to prevent it from clumping in the bag).

Now, in a perfect world, any cheese worth eating would be a good candidate for your macaroni and cheese, but that’s not the world we live in. There are many factors involved, including fat, salt, protein and water content, that make one cheese more suitable than another. For example, resist the urge to melt your favorite creamy Camembert (too fatty) or salty Gouda (too grainy) into this sauce. They’re much better as a sprinkle here and there.

Beware of too much experimentation, though. If, in adding cheeses, you find your sauce appears broken, you can occasionally remedy it by whisking in more milk (if too thick) or Cheddar (if too runny) while it’s still warm. But unlike, say, mayonnaise, once dairy breaks, it’s often broken for good. It doesn’t mean your sauce is inedible; you may just need to lower your expectations. It’ll still be delicious, but not as creamy."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/11/dining/11MAC4/31MAC2-superJumbo.jpg

Kavanaugh faced a whirlwind of new accusations on Wednesday that threatened to derail his nomination to the Supreme Court as key Republican senators wavered in their support and President Trump, in a rambling and combative news conference, acknowledged that he might be persuaded by the testimony of one of the judge’s female accusers.

On the eve of an extraordinary hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee at which both Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who has accused him of assaulting her when they were both teenagers, will testify, Mr. Trump said that “some very evil” Democrats had plotted to destroy Judge Kavanaugh’s reputation. And he lamented what he called “a very dangerous period in our country” in which men are presumed guilty.

But even as he described the charges against Judge Kavanaugh as “false accusations,” Mr. Trump seemed, for the first time, to acknowledge the mounting challenges facing his nominee. Asked why he repeatedly sides with men over their female accusers, the president said hearing stories from Dr. Blasey might change his mind.

“I’m going to see what happens tomorrow,” Mr. Trump said during an hourlong news conference in New York, where he was attending the United Nations General Assembly. “I’m going to be watching, you know, believe it or not. It’s possible they will be convincing.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/us/politics/27dc-kavanaugh1/27dc-kavanaugh1-facebookJumbo.jpg

On Wednesday afternoon, more than 60 classmates from Georgetown Prep and women from sister schools who say they knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school signed a letter to rebut Ms. Swetnick’s allegations and deny ever having met her. “We never witnessed any behavior that even approaches what is described in this allegation. It is reprehensible,” said the letter, which was addressed to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Brett Kavanaugh is a good man. He has always treated women with respect and decency.”

Mr. Avenatti had been using his Twitter account for days to promote what he said would be explosive allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. And immediately after he shared what he called a sworn affidavit from Ms. Swetnick, it drew immediate coverage across social media and cable news as another revelation to rock the confirmation process.

Asked in a brief interview why Ms. Swetnick would be attending parties with high schoolers during her college years, Mr. Avenatti said that the parties in question included people of both high school and college ages.

Mr. Avenatti said he had corroborating witnesses who could back up Ms. Swetnick’s accounts, but was not ready to present them because he was waiting to see if the Senate Judiciary Committee would begin a full investigation into her claims as he demanded, along with an F.B.I. inquiry. In her statement, Ms. Swetnick said she would be willing to appear before the committee.

In an email to Mr. Avenatti on Wednesday afternoon, Mike Davis, the committee’s chief nominations counsel, offered to arrange an interview with Ms. Swetnick.

“Please let me know immediately whether your client will agree to an interview by committee investigators today,” Mr. Davis wrote in the email, which was obtained by The Times. “We can do a telephone interview anytime this afternoon or evening.”

In recent days, Judge Kavanaugh and Mr. Trump, who nominated him in July, have been pushing back against the allegations relating to Judge Kavanaugh’s treatment of women. Mr. Trump called the claims a “con game” by Democrats who were “trying to delay and obstruct his confirmation.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/us/27Swetnick-print/27Swetnick1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg

Kavanaugh, a 1990 graduate of the school.

That was after a campus sit-in that prompted the cancellation of many classes, and protests in Washington, D.C., where two of their colleagues were arrested, and a blistering email that a group of students sent out to their classmates and faculty that said that the Kavanaugh nomination had exposed “our entire school’s culture of legal elitism and fixation on proximity to power.”

It was an abrupt shift on campus. In the days after Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination in June, the school’s website boasted that, if confirmed, he would be the fourth sitting member of the Supreme Court who had gone to Yale. The school’s dean, Heather K. Gerken, called him “a longtime friend to many of us in the Yale Law School community.” Other professors praised him.

Kavanaugh Must Defend but Not Attack.	1	"WASHINGTON — President Trump has some advice for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as he prepares for Thursday’s climactic Senate hearing to confront sexual misconduct allegations: Be more aggressive, show more outrage, push back more. In other words, be more like Mr. Trump.

But what works for Mr. Trump might not work for Judge Kavanaugh. His challenge is not to look like he is attacking his accusers. Anger could touch off a backlash, advisers said, though at the same time he needs to show more indignation than he did during a Fox News interview on Monday when he stuck closely to talking points and looked rehearsed.

For Christine Blasey Ford, the California university professor who will testify about the night she said a drunken Mr. Kavanaugh held her down on a bed and tried to remove her clothes, the challenge is different. An unknown figure, she will be introducing herself to the senators and the nation for the first time, explaining who she is, what happened 36 years ago and why her account is more credible than his denial. She faces a veteran sex crimes prosecutor who will question her for Republicans, a scenario that could rattle even a more seasoned witness.

In her case, according to political veterans, details will matter. She has not been able to determine the date or location of the incident, so the more she can recall about the event, the more specific her account is, the stronger her case will be.

Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, a common theme has emerged connecting the decades-old alleged incidents: heavy drinking.

Christine Blasey Ford described Judge Kavanaugh as “stumbling drunk” when, as a 17-year-old prep school student in suburban Washington, he allegedly tried to force himself on her during a party in 1982. Then, at an alcohol-fueled gathering during his freshman year at Yale, his former classmate Deborah Ramirez says, Judge Kavanaugh exposed himself to her. He has denied both allegations.

The backdrop to these complaints was a culture of hard partying that permeated certain quarters of high school and college life in the 1980s, when binge drinking among teenagers had reached record levels. No evidence has emerged to indicate that the episodes of drinking ascribed to Judge Kavanaugh back then carried forward into his professional or family life, or that the handful of F.B.I. background checks he has faced in his official Washington career unearthed any red flags about his drinking as an adult.

But it is his high school and undergraduate years that have proved to be a mine field during his Supreme Court confirmation process, and questions about drinking during that period are expected to come up when he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Judge Kavanaugh himself has provided grist for this line of inquiry through his wistful references to youthful drinking in yearbook entries and speeches over the years, though he has said he never drank so much that he blacked out or could not remember events."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/us/27Drinking1/27Drinking1-facebookJumbo.jpg

Verdict: False.

This week, two distinct — but equally false — rumors spread about links between Judge Kavanaugh’s accusers and George Soros, the liberal billionaire and Democratic megadonor. (Mr. Soros makes frequent appearances in internet conspiracy theories.)

The first claim was that Ms. Ramirez, who lives in Colorado, had received a fellowship in 2013 from the Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization started by Mr. Soros.

In fact, a different Deborah Ramirez — a law professor at Northeastern University in Boston — received a grant from the organization.

The false claim began to pick up steam on conservative social media on Monday morning. John Fund, a columnist for National Review, tweeted that the “irony of this is just too great.” Mr. Fund subsequently apologized and issued a correction on Twitter."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/business/00viralrumors07/merlin_143346492_c9009ea0-afa2-4320-86ac-ba44177d513f-facebookJumbo.jpg

Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.

In a remarkable and rambling 83-minute news conference on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Trump was by turns combative, humorous and boastful. He defended Judge Kavanaugh and railed against what he called the “big, fat con job” that he said Democrats were perpetrating to derail the nomination, even as he suggested he could still jettison his pick depending on the outcome of a high-profile hearing on Thursday.

Here are five takeaways from the extraordinary exchange:

The president identifies with a man accused of sexual assault, again.

Mr. Trump stopped short of branding the three women accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault or misconduct as liars, although he did say his nominee faced “false accusations.” He said he was eager to hear the testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Christine Blasey Ford, who has said Judge Kavanaugh assaulted her at a party in the 1980s when both were in high school.

But the president made it clear that he believed his nominee and considered the allegations against the judge as part of a smear campaign hatched by Democrats, not credible charges. In doing so, Mr. Trump, as he has many times in the past, sided with a man accused of sexual misconduct rather than the women making those claims. And he made clear that his penchant for doing so is rooted in being accused of sexual assault himself — he says falsely — and his anger at having to contend with such allegations."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/us/26DC-Takeaways/merlin_144387372_ba018681-1bb4-48ef-a4f6-b4308de1bab9-facebookJumbo.jpg

The Chinese, Mr. Trump claimed, were trying to damage his political standing before the midterm elections because of his imposition of tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese goods. Speaking at the United Nations Security Council, where China’s foreign minister was also present, he said, “They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade.”

It was not the first time the president has accused the Chinese of meddling in the nation’s affairs: He has complained that in response to his tariffs, it had imposed retaliatory ones aimed at American farmers and other politically sensitive constituencies in states that support him.

Mr. Rosenstein headed to the White House expecting to be fired after the reports. Once there, he asked to meet with Mr. Trump before any decisions were made about his future, according to people briefed on the discussions. He also said that he wanted to leave on amicable terms and did not want to trigger the president’s ire.

The Fed’s decision, announced after a two-day meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, represents the eighth time that the Fed has raised interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis, and the third time this year. Another increase is expected in December.

The Fed described economic conditions as “strong.” It predicted that growth this year could top 3 percent, before slowing in coming years. Unemployment remains low, inflation remains around the 2 percent pace the Fed regards as optimal, and the pace of investment has increased, it said.

For the first time in recent years, the Fed did not describe monetary policy as “accommodative,” indicating that its benchmark interest rate is rising back toward a level the Fed regards as neutral, meaning that monetary policy is neither stimulating nor restraining economic growth.

Mr. Powell emphasized, however, that the change in wording was not intended to signal any change in policy. He said monetary policy remained accommodative at the moment.



A number of Mr. Powell’s colleagues have argued publicly that the Fed most likely needs to raise rates to a level that begins to restrict economic activity. The Fed warned last year that there was no need for a tax cut in the midst of a steady economic expansion. Mr. Trump and Congress ignored that advice, cutting taxes and increasing spending. The result has been a short-term increase in economic growth, which some Fed officials fear could lead to higher inflation."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/business/27dc-fed/27dc-fed-facebookJumbo.jpg

Canadian and American officials have tried to avoid negotiating in public, but in recent days their differences have started to spill out. Speaking at an event sponsored by Politico in Toronto on Wednesday, David MacNaughton, Canada’s ambassador to the United States, said Canada wanted protection from the Trump administration’s use of tariffs on national security grounds.

Upcoming elections in Quebec, a province whose economy is heavily dependent on dairy, have also complicated negotiations for Canada’s leaders as they look to close a deal with the United States.

Canada is the largest export market for America, and members of Congress from both parties have been adamant that it should be included in any agreement with Mexico. Congress must ratify major trade deals, and an agreement that excludes Canada is expected be difficult to pass.

Some of the world’s oldest structures have survived for 5,000 years in the Orkney Islands.

Off the north coast of Scotland, Orkney’s soft green landscapes hold a trove of things from everyday life before history was written.

More than 3,000 archaeological sites — among them standing stone circles, Norse halls and a Neolithic tomb graffitied by Vikings — have endured for millenniums, scattered across the roughly 70 islands that make up the Orkney archipelago.

At Skara Brae, one of Europe’s best-preserved Stone Age villages, kitchens built around 3180 B.C. are fitted with hearths and cupboards, bedsteads and doors that could be bolted shut.

Today, in forays to remote spits of land, people are working to save some of these places for posterity from the climate changes accelerated by human activity.

Skara Brae.

About half of Orkney’s 3,000 sites, many built before Stonehenge or the pyramids, are under threat from those changes, according to the county archeologist. Some are already being washed away.

Since 1970, Orkney beaches have eroded twice as fast as in the previous century. Others that had been stable are now shrinking. Rains, falling heavier and more often, are dissolving the crusts of soil and sand packs that protect remnants of civilizations.

These threats, now familiar at world heritage sites around the globe, are being answered in Scotland by archaeologists, citizen-scientists, students, government agencies and academics.

Their work is urgent. Orkney’s stories are recorded in disappearing ink.

“Heritage is falling into the sea,” said Prof. Jane Downes, director of the Archaeology Institute at the University of Highlands and Islands. “It’s a very dramatic and obvious sign of sea level rise and increased storminess.”

Note: Archaeological sites date from prehistoric times through the 20th century.

From around the world, troops of archaeologists and students descend in the summers to dig, sift and catalogue imperiled places. There are scrambles for funds. “We’re focused on coastal sites because they’re going to be gone,” Professor Downes said.

At many spots, the only plausible kind of preservation is documentation — done swiftly.

In 1983, an archaeologist drew sketches of a Neolithic chambered tomb at the tip of a peninsula on Sanday island. Then the site was left essentially untouched until last year, when other researchers returned, planning to deploy new tools that would tell them where the people of that area came from and what they ate. But the tomb and its archaeology had shrunk: five feet had been lost to cliff erosion, and it was evident that the remaining 40 feet were headed for the water as well.

At the end of the summer digging season, students packed the site with rock and a thick plastic membrane. Depending on the severity of the winter storms, the protection might keep some of the fine sediments from washing away, and also allow another year of excavation at the deteriorating tomb.

In a short walk along the south shore of Rousay Island, a stunning arc of human activity comes into view. One mile covers 50 centuries: the Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. The Picts, the Viking era, rule by the Norse, and Scottish landlords.

Measuring a section of the Knowe of Swandro on Rousay Island.

The burial of a cow on Rousay in 1963 led to the discovery of human graves and, in them, evidence of long-distance travel. For instance, a silver brooch inlaid with amber and gold filigree from about 750 A.D, is similar to Irish jewelry of the era, said Julie Gibson, a lecturer with the University of Highlands and Islands and the co-author, with the photographer Frank Bradford, of “Rising Tides: The Loss of Coastal Heritage in Orkney.”

Nearby, in a Viking cemetery, Ms. Gibson said: “They found two guys buried in boats. One was born north of the Arctic Circle.”

At the Knowe of Swandro, on Rousay, tribes built atop the homes of predecessors, creating layers of habitation back to Neolithic times. One discovery at Swandro this summer was a rock anvil used 1,500 years ago by a Pictish coppersmith, still smudged with the carbon grime of the forge.

Smithy's

“You can see where the smithy put his hand and his knee,” said Steve Dockrill, a senior lecturer at the University of Bradford.

The anvil is among the finds that have emerged since 2010, when Julie Bond, an archaeology professor at Bradford, strolling the beach at Swandro, spotted a stone jutting up. She performed a field test. “I gave it a kick,” Professor Bond said. “The kick is an important archaeological tool.”

The Swandro project has a charitable trust to support equipment, tests and housing. Virtually all the Orkney digs rely on donations to supplement thousands of hours of free labor from students. In early August, as professors and students from Bradford, Highlands and Islands, Orkney College, the City University of New York and elsewhere finished their summer fieldwork, they hoped the sites would be there the following year.

Each tide washes away midden, domestic waste heaps, that provide a “cultural and economic biography,” Professor Bond said. “We did core sampling at low tide eight years ago, and you could see settlement materials. When we did it again a couple of years ago, it was gone.”

Warming Planet, Vanishing Heritage How climate change is erasing cultural identity around the world. Part 1 Easter Island Part 2 Cedars of Lebanon

From 2012 to 2016, more than 1,200 volunteers, trained by the Scottish Coastal Heritage at Risk project at the University of St. Andrews, mapped vulnerable sites in Scotland, scores of them on the Orkney and Shetland islands. The report is, in effect, a guide for archaeological triage.

In 2015, a community group on Sanday painstakingly moved a mysterious Stone Age structure known as a burnt mound to a heritage center, away from the shorefront where it was being battered.

Elsewhere, residents are sandbagging an 11th century graveyard to keep skeletons from spilling out. Public agencies are using laser scans to map changes to the beach in front of Skara Brae, where the waters of the Bay of Skaill lap ever closer.

A storm revealed parts of Skara Brae in 1850. To protect the site from the advancing bay, a sea wall was built in 1927. There had been no bay in the village’s Stone Age heyday.

Thanks to the sea wall, Skara Brae remains intact, Ms. Gibson said, in contrast with an unprotected mill a few hundred yards away that has been demolished by tides and storms since 1972. Similarly, the Midhowe Broch, an Iron Age tower on Rousay, has been successfully defended since 1934 by a sea wall. “We’re learning where physical structures can be used for a limited time, and others that can work permanently,” Ms. Gibson said. “Permanently, meaning 100 years.”

Natural changes in climate over the last 15,000 years made human habitation not only possible on the islands, but attractive to succeeding generations. The farmers and fishers put little pressure on the land, other than depleting the timber. Stone was a primary building material. Things lasted.

Midhowe Broch, defended by a sea wall.

With tide and time, most beaches will grow and shrink as the sand and sediment subtracted from one spot are added to another. But nature’s rhythms are being accelerated by human actions.

“Sea level in Orkney has been rising over thousands of years, and so coastal flooding and beach erosion is nothing new,” said Jim Hansom, a professor of geomorphology at the University of Glasgow and principal investigator for Dynamic Coast, a report commissioned by the Scottish government to assess coastal change. “What is of concern is that the extent and pace of erosion since the 1970s has increased.”

Some Orkney beaches have narrowed an average of 16 inches per year since 1970, compared to an annual average loss of eight inches between 1890 and 1970, according to data in Dynamic Coast. In addition, Professor Hansom said, more beaches are eroding.

Rainfall in Northern Scotland increased nearly 26 percent from 1961 to 2011, according to Historic Environment Scotland, the public steward of Scotland’s historic sites, which has studied risks to Scottish heritage from climate shifts. “The changes have speeded up,” said Mairi Davies, climate change manager for the agency. They are, she said, significantly faster than at any other point in the last 100 years.

The new extremes have led to archaeological epiphanies.

Walking across Cata Sand on the island of Sanday on a windy December day in 2015, Professor Downes and colleagues noticed an upright stone and red soil that turned out to be hearth scrapings. They found an early Neolithic house, older than those at Skara Brae.

A small dune had protected the site for thousands of years. But a storm in 2012 ripped the dune away. The next one may erase the Stone Age house.

With students and archaeologists from her own school and the University of Central Lancashire, Professor Downes has spent the last three summers digging between tides and documenting the artifacts.

The waters and storms that exposed these sites will also, before long, destroy them. The coastal survey forecasts that Cata Sand will lose about 80 feet of beach by 2050.

“That’s why this site is so important in trying to understand the lives of past societies,” Ross Drummond, a student at the University of Highlands and Islands, said. “The archaeology will be washed away for good, and future generations will only have our records and findings to go on to understand the story of Cata.”

In 1999, a few Orkney treasures were listed as world heritage monuments by Unesco, which said the islands had been a “center of innovation and experimentation” in art and architecture that spread throughout the Neolithic world. Among them is Maeshowe, a passage tomb built in 3000 B.C. Its entryway aligns with the setting midwinter sun, much like a tomb at Newgrange, 500 miles south in Ireland. (More than 4,000 years after Maeshowe was built, Vikings broke in and carved runes on the walls. A fit-to-print graffito roughly translates as: “Thorfinn wrote these runes.”)

The most sprawling neolithic Orkney site, the Ness of Brodgar, is only now emerging on a neck of land surrounded by water. Its discovery was pure serendipity.

The Ness of Brodgar.

In 2003, a couple hired a farmer to plow a sheep field outside their retirement home to ready the ground for a wildflower meadow. On the final turn, he hit a stone — one that had notches carved into it. The stone was part of a group of monumentally scaled structures, all buried.

Near them was an impossibly massive wall, also buried, 18 feet thick in places. Until then, the area’s landscape had been dominated by two circles of standing stones, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness (they appear on the album cover of Van Morrison’s “The Philosopher’s Stone”).

The Ness totals six acres, about eight American football fields, and is rich with artwork and heaps of cattle bone from mass feasts, said Nick Card, director of the site. With less than 10 percent excavated, he said, 35,000 items have been collected.

Archaeologists and students trowel the soil, whisk dirt off promising bits, then bag them.

Ongoing work at the Ness of Brodgar.

“I thought you’d have to be really lucky to find anything,” Kaehlin Terry, 22, a senior from Willamette University in Oregon, said. “But every 20 seconds, you come up with pieces of bone, stone tools, pottery.”

Across vast historical ages, ordinary time scales blur.

The grand spaces at the Ness of Brodgar, like the homely kitchens of Skara Brae and the tomb at Maeshowe, were built thousands of years before scribes first told of Buddha and Moses, Lord Vishnu and Jesus Christ.

But he could no longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.

“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” Mr. McCullough said. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”

What had thrown his affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, Mr. McCullough received around $900 every month to supplement the roughly $650 a month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.

It was not just that he now received roughly $50 less a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut — the cost of a week’s groceries — was painful. (Others have experienced worse: The average working family has lost more than $100 a month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)

What really hurt Mr. McCullough was how that loss was compounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.

Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment, a dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In Mr. McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.

By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/world/27child-poverty-p1/xxchild-poverty1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg

This is precisely why the Senate needs to stop trying to ram through this nomination by some arbitrary deadline and arrange for a thorough and nonpartisan inquiry.

Unlike Christine Blasey Ford or Deborah Ramirez, Ms. Swetnick is not claiming to have been assaulted directly by Judge Kavanaugh. But her accusations directly speak to his repeated insistence that he never behaved in a demeaning or disrespectful manner toward women. In his recent interview on Fox News, the nominee, seated primly beside his wife, presented his teenage self as a virtual choir boy, chastely focused on academics and sports and weekly church attendance. The nominee even said that he remained a virgin throughout high school and “for many years thereafter.”

That was a risky defense, and Judge Kavanaugh seems to be reconsidering it. In an opening statement prepared for him to deliver at his appearance before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, the nominee now allows that he was “not perfect” in high school. He admits that he may have drank too much on occasion (though rarely on school nights) and that he may have said and done things that now make him “cringe.”

Yet he maintains that it is inconceivable that he would have sexually wronged anyone at any time. And he fiercely brushes aside all of the accusations to arise after Dr. Blasey came forward as part of plot against him. “Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired,” his prepared statement says. “There has been a frenzy to come up with something — anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious — that will block a vote on my nomination.

But we’re in a moment during which himpathy is so thoroughly on display, in such a public way, that the time is ripe to push for a mass moral reckoning.

What the Kavanaugh case has revealed this week is that himpathy can, at its most extreme, become full-blown gendered sociopathy: a pathological moral tendency to feel sorry exclusively for the alleged male perpetrator — it was too long ago; he was just a boy; it was a case of mistaken identity — while relentlessly casting suspicion upon the female accusers. It also reveals the far-ranging repercussions of this worldview: It’s no coincidence that many of those who himpathize with Judge Kavanaugh to the exclusion of Dr. Blasey are also avid abortion opponents, a position that requires a refusal to empathize with girls and women facing an unwanted pregnancy.

What makes himpathy so difficult to counter is that the mechanisms underlying it are partly moral in nature: Sympathy and empathy are pro-social moral emotions, which makes it especially hard to convince people that when they skew toward the powerful and against the vulnerable, they become a source of systemic injustice. So, for those for whom himpathy is a mental habit prompted by biased social forces, and not an entrenched moral outlook, the first step to solving the problem is simply learning to recognize when it’s at work, and to be wary of its biasing influence.

The second step to solving the problem of himpathy is listening to girls and women. Do you wonder why someone might not come forward to report sexual assault as an adolescent girl? Listen to Dr. Blasey, who told The Washington Post that at the time she was terrified that she would be in trouble if her parents realized she had been at a party where teenagers were drinking. She recalled thinking: “I’m not ever telling anyone this. This is nothing, it didn’t happen, and he didn’t rape me.” It wasn’t until years later, with the help of a therapist, that she emerged from this denial and recognized the episode as traumatic.

In other words, like many women, Dr. Blasey needed a long time to break a silence born out of society’s entrenched deference to privileged men. It’s a deference that Mr. Trump and Judge Kavanaugh’s other supporters are now demonstrating vividly.

It referred to the then-popular idea that girls could go as far as they wanted with a boy as long as everything stayed, um, intact.

All of this brings us to Brett Kavanaugh, who appears to have been a T.V.A. member.

“Never had sexual intercourse with anyone in high school?” asked a Fox interviewer. “Correct,” said a somber Supreme Court nominee, who added that he had maintained that record for “many years after.”

Except maybe not.

Three women — Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick — are now accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct as a teenager and young adult.

Swetnick, the latest accuser, described Kavanaugh as a “mean drunk.”

This is explosive, extraordinary stuff.

However, Kavanaugh has categorically denied that any of this ever happened.

In an interview on Fox News, Kavanaugh said that he had always “treated women with dignity and respect” and that he “did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter.”

I must say that I found his specification of sexual “intercourse” interesting here. First, sexual assault doesn’t require intercourse. Second, one can be sexually intimate — or sexually violated — without intercourse.

On four critical policy fronts, President Trump foreshadowed his intention to ignore our greatest threats and to stoke fresh conflict where it is neither necessary nor wise. More telling than his rabidly ideological speech to the General Assembly was the president’s more substantive remarks before the Security Council on Wednesday. And by now we have ample reason to conclude that Mr. Trump generally means what he says and (eventually) does much of what he threatens.

First, President Trump doubled down on his determination to exonerate Russia and minimize the serious threat that it poses to us and our allies. In a Security Council session devoted to the preventing the proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, Mr. Trump ignored Russia’s recent attack with a deadly nerve agent that severely sickened four people in Britain and may have killed one other. He neglected to name Russia as the principal violator of United Nations sanctions on North Korea. And he failed to condemn Russia’s repeated lies to cover for Syria’s use of chemical weapons."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/opinion/26riceWeb/26riceWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg

President Trump didn’t mention it at the United Nations, but America is helping to kill, maim and starve Yemeni children. At least eight million Yemenis are at risk of starvation from an approaching famine caused not by crop failures but by our actions and those of our allies. The United Nations has called it the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and we own it.

An American bomb made by Lockheed Martin struck a Yemen school bus last month, killing 51 people. Earlier, American bombs killed 155 mourners at a funeral and 97 people at a market.

Starving Yemeni children are reduced to eating a sour paste made of leaves. Even those who survive will often be stunted for the rest of their lives, physically and mentally."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/opinion/26kristofSub/26kristofSub-facebookJumbo.jpg

Wade, a precedent that he then voted, in dissent, to repudiate when the opportunity arose during his first year on the Supreme Court bench.

It matters that the man who is now the court’s senior associate justice, and who would turn the constitutional clock back to the 18th century if he ever found four colleagues to agree with him, distanced himself during his confirmation hearing from the extreme conservative views he had spent years espousing in speeches. Those were, he claimed, nothing more than the musings of a “part-time political theorist.” Pressed to explain his position that there was a “natural law” higher than the Constitution, he uttered perhaps the most candid line of the entire proceeding: “I certainly never thought I’d be having this discussion.”

And I’d like to think that people remember his remarkable description of the transformation he underwent when he became a judge and “shed the baggage of ideology.” It was an “amazing process,” he told the senators. “You want to be stripped down like a runner.”

In one way, Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court nominee is Clarence Thomas’s opposite. His conventional qualifications are not in doubt. (The American Bar Association committee that deemed him “well qualified,” the organization’s highest rating, had adjudged Clarence Thomas to be only “qualified,” with a minority of the members deeming him “unqualified.”) After a Supreme Court clerkship and 12 years on the federal appellate bench, he has an easy familiarity with the intricacies of the Supreme Court’s docket. His avoidance of direct questions about his substantive views was graceful to the point of tedium, and not a surprise to anyone.

So what should the public remember from the “real” Brett Kavanaugh hearing? Again, to be clear, I don’t mean to minimize the importance of the hearing scheduled for Thursday. My concern is that the vulnerabilities that have come to light in recent days — not only Dr. Blasey’s precise allegation of sexual assault but also tales of the nominee’s heavy drinking in high school and beyond, his disturbingly suggestive yearbook entry , and his buddy who could say a lot but who chooses not to talk — collectively have already started to drown out the vulnerabilities that should have made the nomination something other than the partisan glide path to confirmation that it was on when the first-round hearing ended."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/opinion/26greenhouseWeb/26greenhouseWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg

Despite the advent of antibiotics, tuberculosis had remained endemic in parts of the country. Those miracle drugs were good at curing individual cases of TB, but people could pass the disease on to others long before they developed obvious symptoms, received proper diagnoses or were effectively cured.

But when Mr. Comstock looked at data from rural Alaska, where 30 percent of adults were still infected with the disease nearly a decade after a cure became widely available, he saw a path forward: Antibiotics could eradicate tuberculosis, but only if they were given to people before they became contagious. In other words, doctors couldn’t just treat the people who were visibly sick. They would have to test all of the people that person came into contact with, and treat the ones who tested positive — even if they didn’t have symptoms yet. That way, the bacteria that caused the disease would be killed before it had a chance to spread.

In richer countries like the United States, Britain and Canada, that strategy has long since become a norm of public health. It’s helped eradicate TB from all but the poorest quarters — and, in some cases, even from there. And it’s kept some serious outbreaks from becoming epidemics. In poor countries, though, the approach has been deemed impractical. Tracking down all of a given patient’s contacts is difficult in the best of circumstances, the thinking goes, and resources are scarce enough that giving drugs to people who are not yet sick sounds extravagant.

And so, tuberculosis remains the world’s leading infectious disease killer, by far. It infects some 10 million people around the world every year, killing roughly 1.5 million . That’s some 4,000 deaths per day. By comparison, Ebola killed four people in 2017. America’s opioid epidemic kills about 115 people a day."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/opinion/26TB/26TB-facebookJumbo.jpg

The dream where I’m legless

isn’t a nightmare, and I’m not

afraid — there’s light and a river

and everything is exactly

how I’d hoped. I’m not tethered

to the earth. I’m not tied down

by gravity, dragging my legs

along the bank gravel, not searching

for the softest patch of moss.

I’m not even tired, and though

I’m certain the dream

is an elegy, it sounds exactly like

a praise song. In the dream

my legs break free of me

and I watch them float away.

The coffin in my chest

blows open in the wind,

and for once I think I know

what it’s like to be without

all our dead and heavy things.

Dear S —

I’ve said this all before

and anyway, you had

already been picked up,

held down, put under,

and refashioned;

you were already

dreaming your body

in some gravity-less

country, already calling

it a river, Mars. Let’s go

back to wherever it is

we were made for first:

to water, or a rusted

windswept planet where

everything floats and women

are part horse or fox, knocked

off kilter and galloping left

to get where they were meant

to go. We’d miss it here eventually.

The boat that brought us, I believe

in it. But having found you

I am seeking out the channel

where we came from.

Sister, take my hand?

Dear M —

What we leave down

in the canyon — the stain

of us — red on red,

hemoglobin on hematite,

the trace of us the one true

out of sight, a place only

forgotten animals tread, we’re

pinned to rock in outline

and sketch, the idea of us

a puzzle no one’s yet seen

by bodies and their weight,

we start again, we take

another shape, we learn

our worth by learning

what we’re not, like new

animals or children who,

finding themselves wingless, still

test the air and fall.

Dear S —

Look, there, our dead

and heavy elements

are piled high beside

the silhouette of what

we were before — look,

there our prior selves

hush out like matches

once they’ve lit the pyre.

The light climbs high,

too far away from anybody’s

home to be a flare. Look,

let’s watch until the whole of it

cools first to smoke, then goes.

S, I think we will be suited for it:

wingless, leaping off —

I’d like to think as we lift

ourselves to go, in this newness

we leave it all behind — a grave, a name,

And Wright was not a particularly credible witness. Even Mayer and Abramson conceded that “her files contained ample ammunition for anyone trying to embarrass her,” including a checkered workplace history in which she was fired by a congressman’s office, resigned from a State Department job and immediately accused her boss of racism, and then was fired by Thomas himself for poor performance, after which she reportedly told a friend that she was “pissed” and wanted “to get him back.”

Which doesn’t mean that she was necessarily lying when she claimed Thomas had made persistent and sometimes lewd advances; it just means that she was not some slam-dunk, Hill-vindicating witness, but someone whose testimony would have raised lots of reasonable doubts.

The same problems attach to other testimonies. When Abramson revisited the Thomas case earlier this year for New York Magazine, she pointed to two other female witnesses who could confirm Thomas’s penchant for inappropriate remarks. But one’s account surfaced secondhand, and the witness herself immediately issued a statement that “she never experienced any type of inappropriate behavior.” The other, Thomas’s girlfriend at the time of the Hill case, offered her stories — which were mostly about general lasciviousness rather than harassment — nearly two decades later while shopping a memoir and expressing irritation with Thomas’s conservative record on the bench.

But does all of this add up to a clear vindication of Thomas? No, I don’t think so. There were weaknesses in Hill’s testimony but no clear motive for such a dramatic fabrication, Mayer and Abramson found witnesses from Thomas’s workplace who had heard about the famous “pubic hair on a Coke” can line that he denied uttering, there was plausible testimony as well hearsay that he had a pornography habit of some sort … I could go on.

My own sense, when I wade back into the “he said, she said” detail, is that neither of their testimonies were entirely believable, and that there’s some missing piece of the story that may never come to light. But that’s pure supposition, rather than something that I would stake myself to with any sort of certainty.

And the importance of uncertainty is what this excursion into the 1990s should convey. If you are a partisan, an activist, a politics obsessive, any certainty you feel about Brett Kavanaugh right now is probably too strong. And any mystification or bafflement or anger that you feel about someone else’s certainty — how it simply must be cynical, manufactured, malign — should be tempered by a recognition that your own certainty might have to be revised 20 years from now, that how you read the evidence in the heat of a polarized moment might not be the only way to read it, and that not every historical controversy or scandal gets settled cleanly or wrapped up in a neat moralistic bow.

Again, I apologize for the lecturing tone. Now back to your corners for the hearings.

Continued weak environmental governance, the scientists warned, could lead to the loss of up to 17,000 square miles of rain forest a year, endangering the entire Amazon ecosystem.

Why this change in policy? The scientists put it succinctly: “In exchange for political support, the Brazilian government is signaling landholders to increase deforestation.”

President Temer’s minister of justice is pushing plans to allow agribusiness to rent indigenous land that had been off limits to developers. Other proposals would effectively freeze the creation of new protected areas, open others to resource exploitation and block the mapping of boundaries of indigenous lands, potentially opening native communities and their forests to invasion by miners and ranchers.

Indigenous territories contain more forest than all of the government’s conservation units combined, and historically Brazil’s native peoples have been far more effective in defending the rain forest than the government or private landowners.

The anti-environment agenda is being pushed by of a coalition of large landowners and agribusinesses in Congress (the “bancada ruralista” or so-called ruralists). Regular revelations of corruption involving government ministers, legislators — and also, President Temer himself — have provided them with cover to pursue regressive measures, like a proposed constitutional amendment that would prevent Brazil’s regulators from blocking environmentally unsound road and development projects.

Scores of such projects planned for inaccessible regions of the Amazon may be fast-tracked should the amendment pass and the environmental review process is gutted as a result, as now seems likely. For example, the 540-mile long BR-319 highway would, if completed, open a vast area in the central and northern Amazonia to deforestation.

Not only is little being done to prevent illegal land use, some laws have encouraged it. Last year, the “ grileiro” or land-grabber, law legalized tracts of nearly 6,200 acres that were taken illegally — a boon to land speculators and others who seize public lands for their own use."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/opinion/26Schiffman1/26Schiffman1-facebookJumbo.jpg

By Kim Tingley

A modern building of cedar, stone, steel and glass, set in a wooded sanctuary, houses the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, N.Y. On a wet morning in August, I visited the office of Mike Webster, the director of the lab’s Macaulay Library, home to one of the most comprehensive collections of natural-sound recordings in the world. Webster is a biologist who studies sexual selection and mating behavior in wild birds, and that includes the question of how their songs evolve. Decoding birdcalls and songs has always been a crucial component of ornithological research, but scientists are also increasingly analyzing the acoustics of many other species as a way to measure their health and that of their habitats. “The Macaulay ‘Library’ is not a real good name,” Webster told me. “A better way of thinking about what we are is as a biological research collection or museum. In most places, you have skins and bones. Specimens capture traits over time. But traits that are not captured are behavior. So we’re like a collection of behavior.”



As Webster searched the Macaulay database for samples to play, it struck me that I had so far considered him and his lab only visually: I’d noticed the striking architecture, all the trees, the slate-colored sky, along with his beard, his plaid shirt and the friendly-seeming crinkles around his eyes. And though the pitter-pat of the rain and the tone of Webster’s voice undoubtedly shaded those impressions, I was not aware of their doing so. Nor, if I had been, would I have had much of a vocabulary to translate those sounds into print. Part of the reason for this is straightforward biology: As primates, we tend to see better than we hear. Culturally, a preponderance of visual communications (street signs, books, body language, Tinder) reinforce this preference for sight. But another, more complicated reason has to do with what sound is and is not.

“I can play a heartbreaking one for you,” I heard Webster say, followed by a click. Consider that “click,” remarkable in its onomatopoetic ordinariness. We know instantly where it came from: Webster’s mouse. Or did it? Depending on your philosophical bent, it could have also come from his finger, or the movement of his finger against the mouse, or a burst of energy traveling outward from the mouse through the air in waves, or from the vibration of the drums in Webster’s and my ears in a manner our brains registered as “click.” It could have originated as all of these; in that case, is it still a finite unit from inception through reception? Defining that “click” — invisible, temporary, a byproduct of an event that ended the moment it began — prompts us to re-examine our concept of reality in a way that looking does not. “This is what sound is,” Michel Chion, a French composer and filmmaker, writes in “Sound: An Acoulogical Treatise,” “this coming and going where something has moved in the meantime, between the coming and the going.” In short, sound is, by its very nature, not an object but a journey through space and time.

Paradoxically, the photographs on the following pages, accompanied by recordings, are fixed. They are defined by the page, whereas sound has no similar boundary. We see them in the present tense, but we listen (always, but doubly so with recordings) to the past. What, then, can a picture tell us about a sound — what can looking teach us about listening — and vice versa? One answer is that the evanescence of sound underscores the inevitability of loss and, in turn, deepens our capacity to appreciate what is beautiful — to be surprised.

Click. Strains of discrete, flutelike notes filled the room. I heard them as playful, cheerful, until Webster explained that they were the voice of a long-dead bird, captured on tape back in 1976. “Kauai Oo,” Webster said between calls, naming the extinct Hawaiian species, whose mating pairs duetted. “This is the last one ever recorded. He’s waiting for someone to respond.”

Humans are a visual species except, crucially, at our beginning and end. “In terms of development, hearing is one of the first things that turns on,” Aaron Rice, a bioacoustics researcher at Cornell, pointed out, referring to our time in the womb, when, at about 15 weeks, we begin to develop the ability to hear the swishing, thumping cacophony of our mother’s body. “They tell emergency medical services to always keep talking to a victim, because hearing is the last thing to turn off.” Our middle ears and those of countless other creatures originated as the gill- and jawbones of fish and help us balance ourselves. Below 20 hertz, we stop hearing a sound and start feeling it as vibration. “Hearing is a way of touching at a distance,” the Canadian composer and environmentalist R. Murray Schafer writes in “The Tuning of the World,” “and the intimacy of the first sense is fused with sociability whenever people gather together to hear something special.” Eons ago, as early mammals grappled with the challenges of finding insects among the foliage of dimly lit forests, they evolved large, front-facing eyes and bigger brains, which eventually led to the dependence on sight for orientation and communication among modern humans and other primates. Storytelling, though, remained an oral tradition in the West until the advent of the printing press in the 15th century. Over the next 400 years or so, the eye gained an advantage as a collector, retainer and disseminator of information. Then the arrival of Thomas Edison’s phonograph offered a widespread way to record and play back sound.

As audio recording gradually improved, musicians were among the earliest to appreciate what this new technology could reveal about the natural world. In the 1990s, Bernie Krause, a soundscape ecologist and former professional musician, put forward the hypothesis, now generally accepted, that each creature in a given soundscape occupies an “acoustic niche,” a finite bandwidth at a certain frequency and time of day or night, ensuring that it can be heard. By comparing spectograms — visualizations of sound — of recordings he made at various sites over years and even decades, he began to show that masking an animal’s bandwidth with human noise could be tantamount to bulldozing its physical habitat. Around the same time, Christopher W. Clark, whose musical background included training as a choirboy, founded a bioacoustics laboratory at Cornell and enlisted colleagues there in linguistics, engineering, anthropology and other disciplines to help him develop a language to describe the ineffable qualities of music and the recordings that biologists were bringing back from the field, some of which were inaudible to the naked ear. “Mayflies stridulating on a weed stem sounds like jug band,” Clark says. “Speed up the blue whale’s song 60 times, and you hear the rhythm.” Perhaps the greatest value of eavesdropping on these previously unheard utterances, Clark and other bioacousticians felt, was the chance it offered people who were neither scientists nor musicians to connect with other beings. “The biology of sound in land, sea and skies, the magnificence of the living symphony — everybody gets it in terms of music,” he says.

Though our ears, unlike our eyes, are open at all times, we often fail to perceive consciously what we hear. In the 1960s, Schafer urged university students in an experimental-music class he was teaching to notice “the sounds of their own environment and the sounds they themselves inject into their environment” — voices, breath, the rustling of fabric, the scratching of a pencil. He gave them “ear cleaning” assignments: Write down everything you hear; try to find silence; tape a conversation, replay it and note sounds you did not intentionally record. “Before we train a surgeon to perform delicate operations, we first ask him to get into the habit of washing his hands,” he pointed out. “Ears also perform delicate operations, and therefore ear cleanliness is an important prerequisite for all music listening and music playing.” Greater acoustic awareness, however, comes at a price. Go to the most peaceful place you can think of, and try Schafer’s exercises; odds are it will never seem quite as peaceful again. And in fact, a collaborative study by the Natural Sounds and Night Skies division of the National Park Service has documented that human-made noise has doubled the background sound-level volume in more than half of its protected areas, disrupting wildlife and detracting from the experience of visitors — who are, of course, making much of that noise themselves.

In humans, prolonged exposure to noise has been linked with cardiovascular problems, heightened stress levels, decreased immune-system function and cognitive impairments, as well as feelings of helplessness that are a risk factor for depression. Researchers have also found that what we hear changes what we see. People who look at photos of national-park vistas while listening to natural sound rate them significantly higher in terms of “scenic beauty,” “freedom,” “tranquillity” and such qualities than they do when the same images are paired with noise from motorcycles, snowmobiles or plane propellers, according to a joint study by Colorado State University, Penn State University and the natural-sounds division. Even so, we continue to elevate landscapes at the expense of soundscapes: To wit, motorcycles, snowmobiles and planes are vehicles that national-park visitors use to sightsee; onboard, those visitors are unable to hear a thing outside their own acoustic bubbles.

Recently, I sought advice from Davyd Betchkal, a soundscape technician and biologist with the natural-sounds division for the Alaska region: What insights could readers could hope to glean from a photography issue devoted to hearing? He directed me to Chion and his fellow filmmaker Walter Murch, specifically to a remark by Murch published in 2005: “You have to invoke the possibility of the sound. You can’t simply be silent and say, ‘This silence is great’; instead, you have to imagine the hundred musicians onstage in order for their silence to mean anything. You have to work with the psychic pressure exerted by the instruments or sounds that are not playing. This is the underpinning of what I try to do with sound, which is to evoke the individual imagination of each member of the audience.”

The potential of those musicians — or volcanoes, or bats, or sand dunes — can be conjured with a photograph. But with the development of recording devices capable of operating by themselves in the field for weeks and even months at a stretch, researchers have also begun to capture sounds whose origin is completely unknown, and thus for which not even a mental image exists. At Cornell, Holger Klinck, the director of the ornithology lab’s bioacoustics research program, played me recordings he made in Antarctica. “You’re standing on the ice, a flat sheet of ice, everything is white or blue, there’s nothing going on, maybe a few penguins,” he told me. “Put the hydrophone in the water, and you think you’re in a freaking jungle.” Many of the sounds — the laser-gun-like glissandos of the Weddell seal; the drumroll-to-static collision of two icebergs — have been identified. Others — an elephantine bellow, a guttural moaning, a sustained foghorn — remain a mystery. These sounds in particular, out of context and untethered to images, create a unique version of the “psychic pressure” Murch describes: a visceral sense of the physical power required to bring them about and, in the formlessness of that power, an awareness of the vast scale at which so much else has come and gone, and continues to come and go, without our notice.

Recording offers ecologists and others a chance to preserve pristine acoustic environments for posterity — and make the public case for saving them from extinction. The idea for the Macaulay Library came in the late 1920s, with the emergence of talking films, a medium that invented novel techniques for artificially coupling images and sounds to elicit emotion. Until then, Murch has written, sounds “seemed to be the inevitable and ‘accidental’ (and therefore mostly ignored) accompaniment of the visual — stuck like a shadow to the object that caused them. ... Recording magically lifted the shadow away from the object and stood it on its own.”

Early reel-to-reel recorders weighed upward of 15 pounds, and because each reel lasted 30 minutes at most, a biologist had to lug mountains of tape into the field too. Advances in technology have significantly decreased the size of recording equipment while exponentially increasing the amount of data they can store; the challenge for bioacoustics researchers now is analyzing the vast quantities of sound they can capture. They are also seeking ways to use that information in real time. For instance, Cornell has buoys in Massachusetts Bay that record underwater 24/7 and process that data automatically; if they detect the acoustic signature of an endangered right whale, they alert an analyst at the lab who can post a warning for nearby ships, say, to slow down, warding off potentially fatal collisions.

But the magic trick that the Macaulay’s natural-sound recordings perform, of asking us to consider what we hear in our surroundings independently of what we see, has existential implications for us all. Eleanor Ratcliffe, an environmental psychologist at Imperial College London who has shown that people perceive bird song as having restorative effects, told me that her subjects often shared anecdotes of bird song in which the sound seemed to color the passage of time, connecting them to memories of growing up and important life events. Jacob Job, a recordist for the park service’s natural-sounds division, told me that when park visitors see him out with his parabolic-dish microphone, they frequently ask what he’s doing. When he explains that he’s making “an acoustical snapshot” (a mixed metaphor that signals the complex relationship between sight and sound and memory), they almost always respond with descriptions of sounds from their own lives. Sound, he said, “evokes emotion and memory so well.”

Indeed, not long after speaking with him, on a visit to my Florida hometown, a friend and I were reminiscing about a hurricane that hit there in August 2004. The storm knocked the power out for days — even weeks, in some spots: Refrigerators ceased humming; radios, televisions and air-conditioners fell silent. It took a while for people to acquire generators, and for that first night, at least, we were quiet and exposed. The sound of the place we had always lived in permeated our dark homes: a cacophonous chirping and trilling so intense it seemed impossible that we had been oblivious to it before and would become so again as soon as our appliances came back to life.

While working on “Ninth Street Women: Lee Krasner, Elaine de Kooning, Grace Hartigan, Joan Mitchell, and Helen Frankenthaler: Five Painters and the Movement That Changed Modern Art,” Gabriel sensed the “irony of writing about these characters as ‘women artists,’” when they themselves refused “to be characterized as such.” As Elaine de Kooning put it in 1971, in a pointed rebuke to the budding field of feminist art history, “To be put in any category not defined by one’s work is to be falsified.”

Too bad for de Kooning, but luckily for us, Gabriel has declined to take such extreme pronouncements as the last word. “Ninth Street Women” is supremely gratifying, generous and lush but also tough and precise — in other words, as complicated and capacious as the lives it depicts. The story of New York’s postwar art world has been told many times over, but by wresting the perspective from the boozy, macho brawlers who tended to fixate on themselves and one another, Gabriel has found a way to newly illuminate the milieu and upend its clichés.

The title comes from the Ninth Street Show of 1951, which brought together a raucous and rivalrous art scene for one short month. “Nothing sold,” Gabriel writes, “but no one cared.” The event established New York as a confident and worthy successor to a war-wrecked Paris, showcasing 72 artists whose styles may have differed but whose mutual influence was palpable. Names that were then known mainly to other artists and curators — Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Robert Rauschenberg — would soon become the mainstays of museum collections and art history textbooks."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/books/27bookgabriel3/27bookgabriel3-facebookJumbo.jpg

The critics’ worry for Apple is understandable, even if their repeated wrongness is a little hilarious. Apple’s two-decade ascent from a near-bankrupt has-been of the personal computer era into the first trillion-dollar corporation has defied every apparent rule in tech.

Companies that make high-priced hardware products aren’t supposed to be as popular, as profitable or as permanent. To a lot of people in tech, Apple’s success can seem like a fluke, and every new hurdle the company has faced — the rise of Android, the death of Steve Jobs, the saturation of the smartphone market, the ascendance of artificial intelligence and cloud software — has looked certain to do it in.

But this year, as it begins to roll out a new set of iPhones, the story line surrounding Apple has improbably shifted. In an era of growing skepticism about the tech industry’s impact on society, Apple’s business model is turning out to be its most lasting advantage."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/business/26STATE/26STATE-facebookJumbo.jpg

前不久的一个周三晚上，40岁的尚飞飞耐心地坐在北京市中心的一家海底捞分店，中国的消费者服务以糟糕著称，这家连锁餐馆却打破了这样的名声。海底捞的一名员工为她免费打磨指甲、涂上颜色。锅中的肉汤冒着泡，香气在空气中飘荡。

尚飞飞的美甲做完了，粉红色的指甲闪闪发光，之后她并不打算继续用餐。她这次来，食物是次要的。

“我觉得海底捞这些特殊服务都太好玩了，”尚飞飞说，她每周都来海底捞做美甲。“比如免费美甲、照片打印机、中国象棋和折纸。”吃火锅时，食客在沸腾的汤里自己煮肉和蔬菜，这是深受中国人喜欢的饮食。海底捞则是中国最受欢迎的火锅连锁店，主要是因为员工全力以赴，接待、服务和娱乐客人。

但是在中国以外，它要推销自己可能会更难。“人们一边等餐一边修指甲是令人作呕的，”香港餐厅咨询公司东西迎客集团(East West Hospitality Group)的首席执行官乔伊·西尔弗斯坦(Joel Silverstein)谈到他去过的一家海底捞中国大陆门店时说。

在中国，火锅最初是为了冬天御寒。现在则是全年都可以享用的美食。中国食客喜欢烹饪过程的参与性：人们围绕着一锅沸腾的汤，将肉放进去，再把它们捞出来，浸入小料。在烹饪过程中，人们还可以社交。海底捞的名字来源于一个有获胜含义的四川麻将术语。虽然连锁店提供各种各样的锅底，但还是主要以四川风味的麻辣锅著称。

在这两起案例中，海底捞都表示道歉，并承诺在其所有分店中彻底整顿食品安全。

现在，客户可以通过挂在墙上的平板电视或桌上的平板电脑观看厨房的实时视频。餐厅也欢迎他们亲自观看食物的准备过程。“原材料特别干净，别的火锅店菜都黏兮兮，”每隔两三天都要在这家连锁店就餐的教师 刘亚丽 说。“我们有朋友聚会都会选择在海底捞。”

其中的原因，与台湾的世界地位中的许多奇异之处一样，可以在它复杂的历史中找到。

正式名称为中华民国的台湾政府，曾统治过整个中国，并在第二次世界大战中和美国一起与日本作战。1945年日本投降后，日本政府放弃了对台湾的50年殖民统治，美国军队在没有征求台湾人民意见的情况下，就实际上把台湾交给了蒋介石的国民党政府。

因为中华民国是第一个受轴心国攻击的联合国成员国，1945年在旧金山签署联合国宪章时，中华民国被授予第一个在宪章上签字的荣誉。它与美国、苏联、英国和法国一起获得了联合国安理会常任理事国的席位。

但四年后，蒋介石的国民党在中国内战中败给了毛泽东的共产党，中华民国逃到了台湾。这导致了一种尴尬的局面：蒋介石在台湾的中华民国政府继续把持着安理会的席位，而拥有人类人口五分之一的中国本身，却被排除在这个世界组织之外。这种情况持续了20多年。

阿里巴巴网站原本意在将中国的小型批发制造商与海外买家联系起来。然而，随着国内消费增长，出口业务被淘宝和作为补充的天猫所超越。淘宝是阿里巴巴与eBay类似的市场，天猫则是较大零售商开设商店的平台。当马云于2017年1月在特朗普宣誓就职前与之见面时，阿里巴巴的这位董事长誓言在未来5年里，有100万美国小企业业主能进入这个平台，并且带来类似数量的就业机会，在这个过程中还能帮助平衡贸易。

当然也存在例外，斯宾塞说，不过，体重和奢侈感之间的联系适用于众多物品，包括盘子和刀叉等餐具、香水，以及葡萄酒。“这就是为什么在餐馆里，侍酒师可能会巧妙地把瓶子递到你手里让你掂重的原因。”

黑是基本色

黑色是与奢华联系最为紧密的颜色，斯宾塞说，这是因为“它大概是我们认为最重的颜色”。

这种关于奢侈的暗示系后天习得，并非先天就有，所以它们也会随着时间的推移而改变。“目前，我在做透明度方面的研究；高级包装的商品应有一个透明窗口，这就能让新鲜度或品质被看见，”他说。

不过，斯宾塞补充道，这种趋势是最近才出现的，因为“传统的奢侈品往往采用不透明的包装。我认为这与当下对真实性的渴望有关。”

分层包装

上周，我开始测试这两款新iPhone。我曾经预测，XS Max更大的显示屏不方便放在口袋里，而且在一只手拿着手机的时候打字或者伸手去够应用里的按钮，会很狼狈。

还有其他的方面，我想我也不会太喜欢。比如，苹果手机的价格越来越贵。XS的售价从999美元起，XS Max从1099美元起，而去年的新款iPhone的起价分别为699美元、799美元和999美元。10月19日发布的iPhone XR起价749美元。

然而，在不同的情境和条件下试用了6.5英寸的XS Max和5.8英寸的XS一周后，我对自己的反应感到吃惊。超大尺寸的设备完全没有让我失望，反而用得很高兴。

这款巨无霸型号在设计上并没有做出太大的妥协。通过消除屏幕边框，苹果在增加屏幕尺寸而不增加体积或降低XS Max的可用性方面，做得很不错。我仍然认为较小的XS更适合大多数人，但很多人会喜欢XS Max。"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/19/business/19TECHFIX01/merlin_143648265_b5969011-b833-4ffa-af85-0a5c6be4397a-articleLarge.jpg

中国的间谍活动一直是美国司法部的国家安全部门以及美国联邦调查局反间谍部门最关心的问题之一。美国司法部也一直在打击违反《外国特工登记法》的行为，其中最引人注目的是特朗普总统前竞选主席保罗·马纳福特(Paul Manafort)由于为亲俄罗斯的乌克兰前总统提供咨询而被定罪。

三双眼睛都定格在Supreme刚出的自行车锁上。这两个男人刚从Soho区的Supreme官方店花66美元的单价买下新品，然后来到几个街区外的Og Ma店里，想以三个400美元的价格卖给她。但她很快对这两人摇了摇头，然后从柜台下拿出计算器，敲了三个数字，递给他们。屏幕上写着375。

“这可是这周最新发售的，”其中一个男人想努力抬价。Og Ma不为所动。她马上把头转到左边，用下巴指了指堆在角落的一堆货。她把手别在胸前，身上那件Supreme是最炙手可热的box logo卫衣。Og Ma不多言，即使她的对手是两个看起来彪悍的男人。

他们放弃了。Og Ma很快数了数一叠现金给他们。“我不讲价，”Og Ma用带着广东口音的普通话对我说，“我说多少，就是多少。”

Og Ma本名姓谢，上世纪80年代的时候在深圳市工商局安安稳稳当国家干部。如今她是纽约街头潮牌圈中大名鼎鼎的Og Ma，以倒卖Supreme闻名。Og是Original一词的缩写，在街头文化里代表首次发行的的正版产品，Ma（妈）则是对50多岁的谢女士的亲切称呼。在纽约这个时尚圣地和文化熔炉里，这个一直打零工、英文也不流利的中国移民，在儿子的帮助下成为世界各地Supreme粉丝心中货最全的卖家之一。

和Og Ma同一个年代的移民，很多都在唐人街做生意，大部分开杂货店或者餐馆。十年前，不管是在唐人街还是在中国，大妈们开的店总会让人想到廉价的地摊货和名牌山寨款。那类生意直到现在仍有很大市场——在北上广深这样的大城市，卖山寨Supreme的实体店与网店这两年层出不穷，其中不少在logo右上角多出的“NYC”字样暴露了它们的真实身份。不过，随着中国年轻消费者越来越富裕、越来越成熟，坚持正版的倒卖商在向价值链上游迈进的过程中赢得了不少拥趸。有机会到纽约的中国潮牌爱好者，被Og Ma的名声吸引，也会到访这家位于唐人街的小店。

在过去的十年里，我亲眼目睹了人工智能领域从一个阶段向另一个阶段的过渡。20世纪80、90年代是人工智能的发现期，我通过在卡内基梅隆大学(Carnegie Mellon University)和苹果公司(Apple)从事语音识别研究，参与了这个时期。再后来，我作为谷歌中国负责人以及中国移动互联网的早期投资者，参与了这项技术的实施阶段。

从发现到实施的转变，标志着人工智能研发重心从美国转向中国的重大转型。发现期大量依赖从美国出来的创新，美国擅长有远见的研究和探索性的项目。美国无拘无束的学术环境、无与伦比的研究型大学系统，以及传统上对移民（我就是其中之一）的开放态度，使其在几十年里一直是人工智能领域重大构想的孵化器

然而，人工智能的实施取决于另一组优势，其中许多正在中国显现出来：丰富的数据、竞争极度激烈的商业环境，以及一个以人工智能理念来积极改造公共基础设施的政府。中国还擅长将一个抽象的科研突破转化为成千上万有用的、商业上可行的产品。这个过程的困难程度，是大多数科研人员没有认识到的，这个过程也让许多中国技术公司得到比它们曾被指“抄袭”的美国同行高得多的估值。"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/23/opinion/23lee/merlin_144065565_fdce1fcb-a8ff-422c-a684-7c125e5f4ed3-articleLarge.jpg

几年前，当微信开始流行时，我在朋友圈（微信中相当于Facebook时间线的功能）发布了一张香港纪念天安门事件的烛光守夜的照片。半小时后，我的老板打电话给我，骂我做出了“危险、不当”的行为，命令我“马上删掉”。我不得不照办，但忍不住想知道这件事为什么泄露得那么快。由于朋友圈中的帖子应该只能被微信上的朋友看到，显然，不是朋友举报了我，就是当局正在监视我的微信活动。这两种情况都让我非常不舒服。"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/20/opinion/20Wu/merlin_76740533_28137ff4-a5f4-4434-9b4b-2a94fc8984dd-articleLarge.jpg

但很遗憾，许多人过于从自己的立场、价值观、情感和个人遭遇出发，不能客观看待、分析、判断自己的观察或研究对象，这是近年来中国自由派包括海外民运力量在涉及中共和习近平时经常出现的一种现象。此种情况在中美贸易战的前戏阶段及贸易战启动后表现得尤其明显，看衰和嘲讽中国和中共之声四起，仿佛只要贸易战打响，中国经济立马完蛋，中共乃不堪一击，习近平地位将不保。特别是前一阶段的北戴河会议，由于习近平缺席官报头版，各种关于政变的谣言不胫而走，让人大跌眼镜。

不是说在讨论问题时不能带有自己的立场和情感，但要努力避免先入为主的偏见，因为它容易扭曲看法。特别是要避免为引来关注度和曝光率，而走向极端。民主化是一项严肃的事业，要使中国尽早走向民主，前提是了解你的研究对象或对手，甚至比它更清楚其优缺点。

但海内外的自由民主力量在对中共和习近平的观察和研究中，存在着两种错误看法，一是“中共速朽论”，一是“习近平无能论”。观察海外中文的政论节目，或者在一些时评家发表于Twitter之类社交媒体的文字中，你会发现，在有关中共和习近平的话题上，除了谩骂、诅咒、发泄私愤和引述道听途说的八卦艳闻、阴谋及有违常识的看法外，很难再看到有分量的东西。不客气地说，这是海外民运衰落的原因之一。"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/28/world/28INT-CHINA-02/merlin_129225008_3bdb3866-c09a-430a-9352-06c6e179affc-articleLarge.jpg

6月，我因被控在立法会内进行“非法集会”而入狱四周，立法会是香港的议会，当时我还是该机构的成员。2016年，中国对一项法院判决的干预，导致包括我在内的支持独立的立法者因不正当地宣誓而被免职。当我们试图进入会议室重新宣誓时，发生了这次“非法集会”。

当局以国家安全的名义取缔了主张分离主义的香港民族党，这个引人瞩目的策略，旨在粉碎支持独立的该团体。这表明香港政府不容忍反对中国共产党的人。反对派人士也仅仅因为集会和抗议而被视为恐怖分子。

为了对世界保持开放，香港就不能接受这一点。中国的做法与帝国主义国家没有什么不同，它利用其权力来控制电信、基础设施和商业市场。如果香港默许这种控制，那么这个城市就会远离文明的民主世界。

已经有太多香港居民害怕讨论民主、自由和人权；需要让他们相信，这座城市要生存下来，最佳的办法就是与北京决裂。但香港的亲北京阵营老辣而无情，而且日益加剧的镇压使得民主活动人士的工作越来越不可能开展。

当香港的主权被移交时，北京允许市民扩大他们在亚洲的经济影响力，通过基础设施和建设项目提供就业机会。但总的来说，香港实际上并没有多少收获，因为北京从香港的殖民历史中吸取经验，推动了大陆的上海、广州和深圳等城市的发展。它们开始繁荣昌盛，而香港居民在经济上日益困难，在政治上被边缘化。"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17WR-YAU-copy/17WR-YAU-articleLarge.jpg

许多人担心，学诚迎合社会潮流的特别有效的佛教模式，恰好缺乏那种当初吸引人们信仰佛教的精神。他的倒台也可能会让中国政府的努力受到挫折，政府正在把佛教推崇为一种在海外能赢得朋友、在国内能提供道德价值观的国教。

两名僧侣在一份95页的报告中写道，最近的事态发展“无法不让人感到心痛和悲哀”，报告详细描述了学诚在性和经济方面的不端。他们要求政府迅速采取行动，否则，“释学诚将会操控这样一个僧团驶向何方，我们难以想象！”

就在不久前，学诚的上升似乎还势不可挡。

他出生于1966年，1988年以优异的成绩从位于北京的国内顶尖佛教学院毕业，去斯里兰卡留过学。两年后，他成为老家福建省广化寺的住持。那时候，受过良好教育的宗教人士相当罕见，政府的国家佛教领袖赵朴初还曾为任命了一位这么年轻的方丈做过辩护，将学诚比作当年带领共产党游击队打仗的年轻领导人。

2004年学诚接管位于北京郊外的龙泉寺后，即使是共产党的官员都开始来龙泉寺学习如何开展慈善活动。 Giulia Marchi for The New York Times

据传记作家说，大约在这个时候，学诚许下了一个诺言。佛教在中国经济繁荣的南方很盛行，但中国北方却没有在社会上活跃的大寺庙。他发誓要改变这种状况。2004年，他得到了接管北京西郊龙泉寺的机会，这座寺庙当时基本上处于毁坏的状态。"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/world/00china-monk-1/merlin_142686675_b8823f0e-5760-40de-b04e-2583c9bb0f0b-articleLarge.jpg

有一次另一家公司想要“搞”他的公司，卡乌尔在一次会议上提起了海滩一事的新闻报道。“我说：‘我老板要为他从来不去的一片海滩上最高法院。我们不是在这儿做样子。这个人是不会跟你和解的，’”卡乌尔说。“然后我就坐在那儿。”

前美国总检察长保罗·克莱门特(Paul Clement)眼下就在科斯拉的法律团队里，自2000年以来，他在最高法院出庭的案件多于任何其他律师。

作为一个法律策略，他将这处地产追溯至美国和墨西哥之间的1848年的瓜达卢佩-伊达尔戈条约，声称这一条约在法律上取代了《海岸法》。 Anastasiia Sapon for The New York Times

他的技能被用来解决一桩由最微不足道的官方指令引发的冲突。买下马丁海滩后，县政府告知科斯拉他要么选择（a）保持公众前往海滩的道路开放，收取停车费不得高于1972年时的每车2美元，要么选择（b）申请一份海岸开发许可来变更公众使用权。他选了（c）a、b都不选，让他的同胞起诉他。

科斯拉随后起诉了加州海岸委员会的实体及其官员个人。他起诉了州土地委员会和圣马特奥县，以及——再一次地——其中的官员。他声称自己遭到了勒索，权利受到侵犯。在他看来，政府强迫他经营赔钱的停车生意。作为一个法律策略，他将这处地产追溯至美国和墨西哥之间的1848年的瓜达卢佩-伊达尔戈条约(Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo)，声称这一条约在法律上取代了《海岸法》(Coastal Act)。

科斯拉赢了，并一度关闭了海滩路对面的大门。加州的立法机构和州长介入，通过制定和签署法令来阻止科斯拉，以重新开放海滩。这一行动需要从他那里购买地役权；州土地委员会估计花费为36万美元，但科斯拉一度估计，他在隐私上的损失至少价值3000万美元。双方一直僵持不下。今年6月，加州通过了一项预算，其中提到如果科斯拉不接受一个出价，就会使用土地征用权来拿下这条路。

在10年的律师计费工时之后，那些与科斯拉打官司的人对他的决心有些敬畏。

科斯拉通过一家有限责任公司持有这里约47座小屋之下的土地。“我不认为他这样做是为了钱。我真的不认为他这样做是出于贪婪，”当地一名居民说。 Anastasiia Sapon for The New York Times

“他只需要申请一个许可，更改开大门的时间，”安吉拉·豪依(Angela Howe)说。她是弄潮儿基金会的法务总监，该基金会是一个非营利组织，倡导公众对海滩的使用，是科斯拉的主要反对者。“感觉就是，哇，你可真行，”她说，“现在，如果最高法院接手，它可能是在对美国所有的海岸管理项目进行裁决。”

2008年，咸京我又发现了一张朝鲜传单——这次是在她父母家的大门底下——它显得如此遥远，就像是从外星球飘来的。那时候她已是一名多媒体艺术家，早已不再相信过去学校里教的历史，她也知道了韩国以前也往国界那边撒自己的传单。这让她陷入思考：在已持续65年的地缘政治悲剧里那些她禁止接触的人，她能否与他们直接交流呢？

一场或许是艺术世界里最不寻常的、仍在进行中的合作，就此诞生了。十年来咸京我不断在电脑上设计出图案，打印出来后通过在俄罗斯或中国的中间人偷运进朝鲜。然后，一群与咸京我素未谋面的不具名工匠，受雇用精工细作的针脚把这些图案变成刺绣。通过贿赂和花招，这些作品被偷运回来。最终，它们会在画廊或艺术展览上展出和销售。

最宏伟的是一些描摹闪亮枝形吊灯的大尺幅作品，有些近12英尺宽、9英尺高，远看就像黑色背景下拍摄的照片。凑近看，细密的针脚就显现出来。枝形吊灯和背景都是一针一线精心绣制而成。

某种程度上，她的刺绣作品试图用艺术让1953年因战争被迫分别的人们重逢。作品结合了南方的优势（技术）与北方的优势（手艺），整个实现的过程危机四伏。

咸京我在作品仓库里查看一幅枝形吊灯的刺绣。有些作品的尺寸达到108平方英尺。 Tim Franco for The New York Times

许多艺术家都谈论冒险，但很少有人像咸京我这样真的冒险。国际制裁禁止与朝鲜这个隐秘王国进行贸易活动，因此至少从理论上讲，她可能因为这些作品的现金交易面临刑事起诉。

与她合作的那些工匠可能受到更严重的处罚。全世界最专制政权之下的这些居民，一旦被发现做这种工作，可能入狱或被处决。这些朝鲜人面对的危险带出艺术伦理的问题，有意也好无意也好，伦理问题成了咸京我艺术作品的一部分。"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/29/arts/29HAM1/29HAM1-articleLarge.jpg

王颖的声望也得到了提升。在影片上映的当天，他回忆起曾接到哈维·韦恩斯坦(Harvey Weinstein)的电话，后者当即同意为他的下一部影片《烟》(Smoke)提供资金。（王颖说，他当时不知道韦恩斯坦的掠夺性行为，但与他合作很困难：“他显然是某种霸凌者。”）后来，王颖导演了多种影片，比如有詹妮弗·洛佩兹(Jennifer Lopez)出演的《曼哈顿女佣》(Maid in Manhattan)，以及家庭剧《都是戴茜惹的祸》(Because of Winn-Dixie)。

“在这个行业里，你很容易被限制在一个类别里，”他说，“我不想被困住。”

在扩展他的疆域的同时，王颖也试图向片厂倡议拍关于亚裔美国人的电影——但没有成功。他的宏大构想，比如一部设定在唐人街的《西区故事》(West Side Story)改编版，遭到了拒绝；他在自己的电影中加入亚洲角色的努力也遭到了拒绝。“我总是说，‘我知道这个角色不是为亚洲人写的，但是为什么我们不能选择一个好的亚洲演员来扮演这个角色呢？’他说。“那将是一场我永远赢不了的斗争。”

粉红是一种多维的、含义变化多端的色彩，它不再只是“适合少女的愚蠢粉色，而是兼具两性的、既酷且潮又反叛的粉色，是各种更复杂想法的一种表达，”斯蒂尔坚称。

展览印证了她的观点，通过几个不声张的阶段，粉红色摆脱了其纯洁、轻快的联想，附上了一种更为反叛的顶撞、有时简直怪癖的情感。歌手加奈儿·梦奈(Janelle Monáe)在她最近的音乐录影“PYNK”中，用身上穿的一件强烈暗示性服装的复制品，把这种情感发挥到了极致。荷兰设计师杜兰·兰廷克(Duran Lantink)设计的灼眼打扮出现在展览中，花瓣状的裤子敞开来，揭示出粉红色调的阴道。

不过，粉红的越轨性影响力有一个很长的形成过程。在西方文化里，从接近紫红到淡而偏粉的这个颜色的各种色调曾受到贵族的喜爱，14世纪后期，来自印度和苏门答腊的新染料制出了更饱满的粉红色后，这个颜色就更受欢迎了。

18世纪中期，蓬帕杜夫人使一种更甜蜜的粉红色成为时尚之颠：在弗朗索瓦·布歇为她画的几幅肖像中，她穿了一系列的满是丝带、时髦且自信的贝壳粉色女礼服和女士晨衣。

粉红色在那个年代男女皆宜，展览中一具穿着耀眼上衣和半长裤的人体模型强调了这一点，它穿的淡鲑鱼色丝缎与奶油色刺绣马甲背心对比鲜明。

但到了19世纪中期，男人们大多已把粉红色留给了他们的姐妹和妻子，她们当中的任何一位都可能穿过时装技术学院陈列的那件19世纪中期的故作忸怩的、粉红色塔夫绸礼服，其多层的裙摆镶嵌着流露的荷叶边。斯蒂尔写道，粉红在那时被视为一种俏丽的颜色，表达了柔软与俏皮活泼的性格。

但粉红也暗示了贴身衣。蕴含着名声不好却有吸引力内涵的女内衣，是泰奥菲尔·戈蒂耶(Théophile Gautier)在1850年的诗作《致一件粉装》(To a Pink Dress)中颂扬的东西，诗人热情地写道，“我太爱穿着那件装的你，它让你看上去如同不着一丝。”

时代不同了，粉红色的形象也在变化。到19世纪晚期，粉红已如野草般平常。苯胺染料的引入，生产出了格外明亮、偶尔花里胡哨的粉红色，让这种颜色的声望下降，变得粗俗，带上了埃米尔·左拉(Emile Zola)小说里女店员和妓女卖弄的色彩。"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/06/fashion/06pink1/06pink1-articleLarge.jpg

Britain's opposition Labour party voted overwhelmingly Tuesday for a policy that would put a new vote on the table if Prime Minister Theresa May failed to get an eventual Brexit deal through the UK Parliament.

And Labour's Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, received rapturous applause at his party's annual conference when he raised the prospect that staying in the European Union would be on the ballot paper.

""Nobody is ruling out 'Remain' as an option,"" he said.

His comments were significant because Labour has been as divided over the issue as May's Conservative Party. Some Labour MPs represent districts in Britain that voted decisively to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, and fear losing their seats if there is a general election. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is known to be a lifelong Euroskeptic.

But the party membership, which propelled Corbyn into power, strongly supports staying in the EU and has forced the leadership's position to evolve. Delegates at the party conference in Liverpool, northwest England, voted overwhelmingly for a motion that calls for a second referendum in the event that Parliament fails to approve an eventual deal.

Starmer told delegates at the party conference in Liverpool that Labour would vote down any deal struck by May.

""If the Prime Minister returns with a deal that does not meet our tests, and that looks increasingly likely, we will vote against her deal,"" Starmer told the rapturous crowd. ""A vague or blind Brexit is a leap to nowhere, and we will have no part in it.""

Starmer said Labour preferred the uncertainty to be settled in a general election ""but if that's not possible, we must have other options ... that must include campaigning for a public vote.""

""Nobody is ruling out remain as an option,"" he added, in remarks that were not included in the text of his speech released by the Labour Party.

Last March, Labour outlined six tests upon which it planned to assess any final Brexit deal, including the provision of a ""strong and collaborative"" future relationship with the EU, the delivery of the ""exact same benefits"" provided by the UK's current membership of the single market and customs union, and the ""fair management of migration"" in the interests of the British economy.

On Sunday, in an article for the Britain's Sunday Express newspaper , May reiterated her opposition to a new Brexit referendum. ""Some are now openly advocating a second referendum and extending Article 50 to delay Brexit, sending us right back to square one,"" she wrote.

Calls for a second referendum have increased since May returned from an informal EU summit in Salzburg, Austria last week and admitted discussions were ""at an impasse.""

May struck a defiant tone during a Downing Street statement in which she called for the EU to ""respect"" the British position and the result of the June 2016 referendum.

She called on the EU to spell out its objections to her plan or come up with an alternative.

""Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it,"" May said."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180925114328-01-brexit-keir-starmer-0925-super-tease.jpg

Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge had opened the scoring on 58 minutes, before Chelsea's Emerson Palmieri pegged Jurgen Klopp's runaway side back eleven minutes from time.

The match was headed to penalties when Hazard, receiving the ball outside the box on the right wing, skipped through Liverpool's defense before whipping a shot into the top corner to score a stunning winner with five minutes to go.

Chelsea's assistant coach Gianfranco Zola hailed the mercurial Belgian as ""one of the best in the world"" following the late solo goal, according to the BBC . ""It's a fantastic goal. Not only the beauty of it but for the time he scored it,"" the former Chelsea talisman said of the second-half sub, adding that he felt the best is yet to come from a ""remarkable"" player.

Huge scorelines; late drama

Meanwhile, beleaguered Premier League side West Ham took the EFL's cup competition as a welcome respite from its league travails to put eight unanswered goals against hapless Macclesfield Town.

The gap between the top flight team and Macclesfield, languishing in 24th in England's fourth-tier competition was too great an obstacle for the Cheshire side, which went down without a whimper to braces from Robert Snodgrass and Grady Diangiana and goals from Lucas Perez, Ryan Fredericks and Angelo Ogbonna after Michail Antonio opened scoring just before the half-hour mark.

Elsewhere, Arsenal continued its resurgence of form under new boss Unai Emery with a routine 3-0 win over fellow London side Brentford, with Danny Welbeck finding his scoring boots after only five minutes, before adding a second before the break.

The Bees' Alan Judge pulled one back through a free kick 13 minutes -- his first goal in almost a 1,000 days following a double-leg break, according to the BBC -- after the restart but Arsenal's French striker Alexandre Lacazette put the result beyond doubt in injury time to advance his side to the next round.

Brentford's Danish defender Henrik Dalsgaard vies with Arsenal's Nigerian striker Alex Iwobi.

It was late drama at Milton Keynes' Stadium MK as the Gunners' arch-rivals Tottenham needed penalties to advance at the expense of Watford -- this year's surprise package in the Premier League -- after Watford's Etienne Kapoue equalized in the 89th minute to cancel out Erik Lamela's goal just three minutes earlier.

fac20ca6a7ff4faaa7fb3ea65ef5f61e	['Judith Vonberg']	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Jeremy Corbyn has an unashamedly socialist plan to transform Britain	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Jeremy Corbyn has an unashamedly socialist plan to transform Britain	1	"London (CNN) The British media landscape may be dominated by Britain's tortuous negotiations to leave the European Union, but the country's main opposition party has other ideas.

The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has spent the past three years repositioning the party firmly to the left of the version fashioned by former Prime Minister Tony Blair, thinks voters are tired of the endless bickering over Brexit and want someone to address their day-to-day concerns.

So on Wednesday, at the party's annual conference, Corbyn sought to articulate an unashamedly socialist program that he believes will propel him to Downing Street in the event that the beleaguered government of Prime Minister Theresa May collapses.

Issuing a rallying cry to voters disillusioned by a decade of austerity since the financial crash of 2008, he called for fundamental reform of a ""broken economic system"" and an end to ""greed-is-good"" capitalism.

In his speech, Corbyn attacked the ""political and corporate establishment"" and a ""deregulated"" financial system, doubling down on a number of policies detailed in Labour's manifesto ahead of last year's general election, at which the party won 40% of the vote and denied May's Conservatives a parliamentary majority.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in Liverpool during the first day of his party's annual conference.

The Labour leadership believes this message will resonate in areas of the UK that voted ""Leave"" in the Brexit referendum of 2016.

But a problem for Corbyn is that Labour's rank-and-file membership, which swept him into the top spot after years on the leftwing fringes of the party, are resolute supporters of Britain's membership of the European Union.

Divisions over Brexit were laid bare on Tuesday when delegates in Liverpool forced a shift in the party's position on a second referendum, voting for a policy that puts a new vote on the table in the event that May fails to get a Brexit deal through the UK Parliament.

Speaking Wednesday, Corbyn sought to play down the divisions on Brexit, saying that Labour aims ""to get the best Brexit deal for jobs and living standards,"" a deal that would underpin the party's broader plan for fundamental economic reform.

He confirmed that Labour would oppose leaving the EU without a deal, and vote against the ""Chequers"" plan -- agreed by May and her cabinet in July but criticized by some EU negotiators. He added that ""all options are on the table"" if the government fails to negotiate a deal that Labour could support. Notably, he did not specify that a second referendum was one of those options.

Corbyn offered an olive branch to May, saying Labour would vote for a deal that kept Britain in the EU's customs union and avoided the return of border infrastructure on the Irish border. It was a politically astute move -- if May returns with such a deal after the conclusion of negotiations with the EU, it could get through Parliament with Labour votes but precipitate a damaging split inside her own party.

An end to 'greed-is-good' capitalism

The comments on Brexit came near the end of a speech that dwelt heavily on a left-wing alternative to the populism of the far right, which has dragged the political center of gravity rightwards across much of Europe.

Corbyn's program echoes the demands of socialist movements around the world, including the Democratic Socialists in the US, in his call for wealth redistribution and a fairer economic system, designed ""for the many, not the few.""

Over the past three days at Labour's gathering in Liverpool, a post-industrial city in northwest England hit hard by austerity, senior party figures have outlined a series of measures that, taken together, amount to nothing less than a transformation of Britain's economic and social order.

Jeremy Corbyn (L) sits with Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell following McDonnell's speech at the Labour party conference on Monday.

Labour has pledged to rejuvenate the UK's neglected high streets, nationalize public services and some major industries, and force all large firms to give their employees a share of the business and a voice on their boards. Critics of Labour say these policies are throwbacks to failed socialist governments of the 1970s. But Corbyn's top team knows they are popular with voters who believe they have been punished for the failings of reckless financiers.

""Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences for millions of people,"" Corbyn said, to rousing applause from delegates.

""But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.""

Left-wing politics alive and well?

Despite internal divisions over Brexit and accusations of antisemitism, recent polling suggests support for Labour remains steady. Voters, it seems, are not turned off by the leftward drift.

Corbyn's rise draws comparisons with the leftwing wave successfully ridden in the US by Bernie Sanders. At an event at the University of Cambridge a few days before the UK general election last June, Sanders praised the Labour leader's willingness to address issues such as wealth inequality, poverty and class.

""Too many people run away from... the grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality that exist in the United States, that exist in the UK, and exist all over the world,"" he said, adding that ""globalization has left far too many people behind.""

But while Corbyn has cemented his dominance over Labour, similar ideas have yet fully to take hold in the US Democratic Party. A turning point was perhaps the unexpected victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley in a New York congressional election in June. Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, a grassroots socialist movement that rose from the success of Sanders,

recent poll suggests that support in the US for a ""move away from capitalism to more socialism"" is higher than at any time in the last decade, suggesting that future successes could be on the cards.

And despite the undeniable growth of far-right parties across much of Europe, a number of left-wing or socialist parties have also been making gains.

The relative successes of Podemos in Spain, Syriza in Greece, Die Linke in Germany and Jean-Luc Melenchon's insurgent movement in last year's French presidential election have shown how left-wing politics can counteract the rise of the right.

Corbyn hopes the same trend can hand him the keys of 10 Downing Street if, or perhaps when, May falls."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180926124550-01-jeremy-corbyn-0926-super-tease.jpg
43574ae8eef34143a4d4d515ad1e732c	['Amika George']	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Why I'm leading the #FreePeriods campaign	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Why I'm leading the #FreePeriods campaign	1	"Amika George is the 18-year-old student founder of #FreePeriods , a campaign that seeks to ensure all British girls have access to free menstrual products. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Last year, when I was 17, I was stunned to hear of a hidden problem affecting thousands of girls in the United Kingdom -- ""period poverty."" Girls as young as 11 were routinely skipping school, or resorting to improvising with socks stuffed with tissue and newspaper, all because they couldn't afford menstrual products.

I was disgusted this was happening right under my nose but even more appalled that the government had failed to take action to end the problem.

Period poverty is, undoubtedly, a product of the patriarchy. It is unjust that a natural, biological process was inhibiting the educational progress of these girls, preventing them from achieving their goals and ambitions, and that our male-dominated Parliament was refusing to act.

So I launched a campaign called #FreePeriods . It started as an online petition to call for the government to provide free menstrual products for girls from low-income families. I then began writing about period poverty, giving media interviews, telling everyone who would listen how girls were being held back because they bleed and happen to be poor.

As the campaign grew, I started to question the archaic perception of periods as a source of shame and embarrassment. Misogyny has meant that periods are ubiquitously tabooed, belittled and euphemized.

This is so wrong. We need to celebrate our periods, unapologetically, and it's incredibly important to involve boys and men (and others who don't have periods) in the conversation, if we want to overcome the stigma that shrouds menstruation.

The message spread and slowly started to creep into public consciousness, and initial curiosity about the campaign soon led to media coverage . Clearly, I was not alone in condemning period poverty, and there was widespread disbelief that this was happening in one of the most prosperous, economically advanced nations on Earth.

We decided to capitalize on this momentum by organizing the #FreePeriods peaceful protest. The aim was to gather together as many people as possible outside Downing Street to shout about the silence. Publicizing the campaign using social media, we called out to all young people, urging them to make their voices heard on behalf of every girl who felt she had no voice. The word spread quickly, and interest grew.

On December 20, 2,000 people braved the cold to stand united against period poverty. Brits of all ages and genders had assembled, dressed in red, and waving banners emblazoned with period puns. As they chanted, ""What do we want? Tampons! When do we want them? Now!"" it was clear that the cry for change was loud and irrepressible. We were energized, mobilized and ready to disrupt the status quo.

In March, the government announced that, for the first time, it would allocate a portion of the funds from taxing period products to an organization that seeks to help address period poverty. As a result of our collective activism, the government listened, and moving forward, young people will be better able to access menstrual products through charities and in schools.

But our fight is far from over. And period poverty is still rife in the UK and globally. Plan International UK, a children's charity, has found that 1 in 10 British girls have been unable to afford menstrual products until now, and UNESCO has revealed that girls in sub-Saharan Africa miss up to 20% of schooldays because of menstruation, while one-third of girls in South Asia report missing school every month during their periods.

We will continue to fight until the government agrees to implement a statutory pledge to end period poverty for good, as the Scottish government has recently done . Until we are certain that no girl will ever miss a day of school due to her period again. Until access to menstrual products is treated as a universal human right, not a privilege.

I am so honored to be working with Goalkeepers, the campaign to accelerate progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals, in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and to be receiving the Global Goals Campaign award during UN Week in New York. I hope that this platform will enable period poverty to be recognized by governments worldwide, and that global leaders will take action to eradicate it from their societies.

Clearly, #FreePeriods has become much larger than the 17-year-old girl who started a petition from her bedroom. Its success, thus far, is a testament to how a message can resonate with the masses and proves the power that young people possess.

Despite criticism from adults who complain about young people spending too much time on their phones, the #FreePeriods campaign has proven that teenagers can truly bring about change by utilizing social media and taking to the public square. I now know that young people are more politicized, passionate and engaged than ever before -- and that this is only the beginning."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180925143320-amika-george-headshot-super-tease.jpg

Pulling on a sensible rhetorical jersey, Macron was on a mission to put himself -- and France -- at the center of things, loudly denouncing the isolationism of Britain and the US.

""Only collective action allows for the upholding of the sovereignty and equality of the people in whose name we take action,"" Macron said. ""This is the reason we must take action against climate, demographic and digital challenges. No one alone can tackle these.""

Trump's administration is allergic to -- and has threatened to break -- the International Criminal Court, which prosecutes war crimes.

Theresa May, as Britain's Home Secretary, was frequently frustrated by the European Court of Human Rights (a largely post-Second World War British creation) when it came to the court's enforcement of the rights of prisoners and terrorists.

The UK is pulling out of the EU, the richest trade bloc on the planet. The US is locked in a trade war with China , pulled out of the Trans Pacific Partnership, a trade bloc of 12 economic powerhouses, and wants to renegotiate the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

The US has also pulled out of the Paris agreement on combating climate change.

Macron clearly believed he spoke for many at the UN when he said: ""If courage is lacking in the defense of fundamental principles, international order becomes fragile and this can lead as we have already seen twice, to global war. We saw that with our very own eyes.""

Of course for a French president with approval ratings at 28%, according to a poll this month conducted by OpinionWay , taking a swipe at Les Anglo-Saxons is rarely unpopular.

But no matter how much Les Rosbifs and Les Yanquees are any French politician's whipping boys, his appeal to internationalism, his passion but style at the podium and a general appeal to good sense will have resonated beyond the assembly's chambers.

Here, after all, is the leader of the only democracy left among the permanent five members of the Security Council that still seems to believe that a world organized under the imperfect structures of multilateral diplomacy and its rules is one worth preserving.

Binding Europe economically within the EU and much of the rest of the world to international conventions has not meant that ""globalism"" has prevented all conflicts. But it could have been much worse."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180824144236-29-trump-gallery-super-tease.jpg

Half of all teenage boys in England drank weekly in 2002, but this figure was down to one in 10 by 2014, the report said

For teenage girls, the same number dropped from 43% in 2002 to 9% in 2014, with similar falls reported in Scotland and Wales.

The findings point to significant reductions in adolescent drinking in Britain. Among the 36 European regions included in the survey, England had scored second-worst in 2002 for the measure -- but by 2014 the country was seventh-best.

Iceland saw the lowest rate of regular teen drinkers, while Croatia, Malta, Italy and Hungary saw the highest - with more than a quarter of boys in each country drinking weekly.

Males and females in Scotland and Wales, as well as males in Northern Ireland, saw a 0.1 year decline in life expectancy at birth. Life expectancy in England has remained unchanged from 2014 to 2016.

Northern Ireland also reported a decline of 0.1 year -- more than one month -- in the life expectancy of 65-year-old males for the past three years.

""2015 to 2017 saw the lowest improvements in life expectancy since the start of our series in 1980 to 1982,"" said Sophie Sanders, ONS statistician for the Centre of Ageing and Demography.

The report suggests annual fluctuations, like the seasonal flu, are possible reasons for the number of deaths.

The largest percentage increase in deaths in England and Wales, since 1968, was recorded in 2015. In 2017 deaths across England and Wales rose by further 0.7% from 2015, which could be another factor in the decline.

Life expectancy improvements have been slowing down in the UK since 2011.

""This slowing in improvements is reflected in the chances of surviving to age 90 years from birth, which has seen virtually no improvement since 2012 to 2014,"" added Sanders.

UK-wide, roughly one in five newborn males -- 21% -- and one in three females -- 32% -- could expect to live to their 90th birthday, with this largely unchanged since 2012.

When looking at life expectancy at the age of 65, the new data found that during 2015 and 2017, a 65-year-old male in the UK could expect to live another 18.6 years and a woman of the same age could expect an average of 20.9 further years.

'Something seriously wrong'

""I wasn't surprised by these findings,"" said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""We've been publishing for several years reports, warning that life expectancy has been stagnating since 2015.""

McKee stated that the UK's population should ""definitely"" be worried about the new data.

""Because we know that whenever life expectancy slows down or goes into reverse that this is often a sign that there is something seriously wrong. It is always a very worrying development and often one of the first signs of political problems,"" he said.""The problem of increasing deaths is mainly in older people and we are concerned that this has coincided with severe cuts to social care.""

Globally several countries have reported a slowdown in life expectancy at birth and at age of 65 for both men and women, but the UK has reported one of the ""largest"" and remains lower than comparable countries, according to the ONS.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Previous research by the ONS shows that European countries, North America and Australia are also seeing no improvement, or declines, in life expectancy figures. A recent study found a similar decline among affluent nations for the first time in decades.

Japan on the other hand continues to have one of the highest life expectancies. In Japan females can be expected to live to 87.0 years, four years longer than what the UK states as its life expectancy -- 82.9 years -- according to the ONS. Other European countries like Spain, Switzerland, France and Italy also have a female life expectancy over 85 years.

The greatest improvement in life expectancy at birth was recorded in the UK between 2009 and 2011, with an increase of 21 weeks for men and 18 weeks for women. The following years saw a decline and the new data published today shows life expectancy improvements of almost zero.

""The tailing off of increases in life-expectancy, and falls in some nations, could reflect the greater financial stresses experienced by this age group,"" said Amanda Burls, professor of public health at City University in the UK, adding that poverty is the most important socioeconomic determinant of health. ""The distribution of the changes in life expectancy across the four nations of the United Kingdom provides some support to this hypothesis as England, where the greatest wealth lies, has been least affected. In addition the mortality rates in children have continued to fall."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180925122743-uk-elderly-couple-stock-super-tease.jpg

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

(CNN) Humiliated in Europe, in deadlock at home, Theresa May appears to be the loneliest leader on the world stage right now. With just weeks to go before the British Prime Minister needs to strike a deal on Brexit, there are few signs of an imminent breakthrough.

Her blueprint for the UK leaving the European Union, known as the Chequers plan, was rejected by EU leaders at a disastrous summit in Salzburg, Austria, last week . As a result, her domestic opponents and their own versions of what Brexit should look like besiege her.

If May were looking for a way out of the political stalemate in Westminster, there is no shortage of alternatives to Chequers. The plan is opposed by both Brexiteer Conservative MPs, who say it allows the EU to keep a powerful grip on the UK, and EU negotiators and leaders, who see it as the UK cherry-picking the benefits of EU membership without paying the costs.

The Prime Minister commands little authority in her Cabinet and no overall majority in Parliament. Chequers was ridiculed in Salzburg last week by, among others, Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, and the French President, Emmanuel Macron.

Yet the Prime Minister's strongest suit is that there is no consensus among her opponents in the Conservative Party or UK parliament or among European leaders. May's intransigence on Chequers frustrates her allies and enemies alike.

aa06437a71bd437893672cd0de656751	['Rob Picheta']	2018-09-24 00:00:00	Obesity to become leading cause of cancer in women	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Obesity to become leading cause of cancer in women	1	"London (CNN) Obesity is set to overtake smoking as the leading preventable cause of cancer in women in the UK, a new report warns.

Cancer Research UK estimated that 23,000 British women will suffer from obesity-related cancers by 2035 -- just 2,000 fewer than the number of cases caused by smoking.

By 2043 obesity will become the most common cause of cancer in women if current trends continue, the charity found

Smoking is currently linked to 12.4% of cancers in UK women, compared to 7.5% that are caused by obesity, according to the British Journal of Cancer.

The gap between the two causes in men is wider because more British men smoke, with 17.7% of cancers among men caused by smoking compared to 5.2% by obesity. A similar change in the leading cause of cancer in males is therefore likely to happen much later, the report says.

The charity analyzed cancer incidence data between 1979 and 2014 to make the projections and used the results as a further call for national campaigns and legislation to reduce the prevalence of obesity by following the blueprint used for smoking campaigns.

""Obesity is a huge public health threat right now, and it will only get worse if nothing is done,"" said Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK's prevention expert.

""The decline in smoking is a cause for celebration. It shows how decades of effort to raise awareness about the health risks plus strong political action -- including taxation, removing tobacco marketing and a ban on smoking in indoor public places -- have paid off,"" she added.

""Bold action"" needed on obesity

Over a quarter of the UK's population is obese, and the country has the highest obesity rates in western Europe, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

While the new study focuses on women, Charlotte Bevan, professor of cancer biology at Imperial College London, told CNN that the trends are inevitable across both genders.

""As smoking rates in men fall, we will see the same trend in men and women -- with obesity becoming a bigger killer than smoking,"" said Bevan who was not involved in the report.

""Many of the physical and chemical changes in the body caused by obesity can promote cancer and can actually help certain cancers to spread, such as prostate and breast cancer,"" added Bevan, who was not involved in the report.

Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said the country had seen a ""sea change in smoking,"" but added: ""Bold action is needed to tackle obesity, the challenge of a generation.""

""It is alarming that obesity could soon become the biggest preventable cause of cancer in women, but sadly not surprising,"" said Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of over 40 organizations and charities working to reduce obesity.

""Environmental factors such as advertising and promotion of unhealthy food and drink are contributing to this public health crisis,"" Cerny added."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180924070148-woman-on-scale-stock-super-tease.jpg

September 21, 2018 is the International Day of Peace.

On Good Friday 1958, thousands gathered in London's Trafalgar Square to protest nuclear weapons. They were responding to a string of test blasts conducted by the United Kingdom, the third nation to join the nuclear club after the US and USSR.

For the next four days, the bravest among them marched to Aldermaston, a small village 50 miles west of London where British nuclear weapons were designed and stockpiled.

On the protesters' signs and banners, a new symbol was making its first appearance. Gerald Holtom, a designer and a pacifist, had developed it specifically for the march just a few weeks prior. He believed that a symbol would make the message stronger.

He was right: The symbol was adopted soon after by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) and went on to become one of the most widely recognized designs in history.

""It's a minor masterpiece with major evocative power,"" said design guru and cultural critic, Stephen Bayley, in an email. ""It speaks very clearly of an era and a sensibility.

""It is, simply, a fine period piece: the ordinary thing done extraordinarily well.""

Semaphore alphabet

The design is meant to represent the letters ""N"" and ""D"" -- standing for ""nuclear disarmament"" -- as they appear in the semaphore alphabet, which is used by sailors to communicate from a distance with flags.

But there's another meaning, according to its creator. In a letter to Hugh Brock, editor of the British magazine Peace News, Holtom wrote : ""I drew myself: the representative of an individual in despair, with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of Goya's peasant before the firing squad. I formalized the drawing into a line and put a circle round it.""

The symbol has been the subject of various different interpretations since its inception. ""All good graphic devices should be lucid and capable of applications in different media,"" said Bayley. ""But this one has the advantage of a nice semantic ambiguity: It can be read in different ways. A missile at lift-off? A person waving in despair? A Druidical reference? But it bypasses interpretation: It's a thing unto itself.""

Ken Kolsbun, a peace symbol historian, believes the design's simplicity played a role in its continued success. ""You can have a 5-year-old draw it,"" he said in a phone interview. ""It's such a powerful symbol with a sort of hypnotic appeal.""

A symbol of peace

Kolsbun has spent decades photographing the symbol, starting in the 1960s in California. ""It came at the right time,"" he said. ""It also kept adapting, like a chameleon, taking on many different meanings for peace and justice.

""It's an amazing design. Big corporations would die for something like this -- just look at how many have their logos in a circle. Not surprisingly, some people draw it incorrectly, without the bottom line, and unwittingly draw the Mercedes logo.""

In the US, the symbol was first used by the civil rights movements. It was probably imported by Bayard Rustin, a close collaborator of Martin Luther King Jr., who had participated in the London march in 1958. Crossing the Atlantic, the symbol lost its association with nuclear disarmament and came to signify, more generally, peace: ""In the 1960s in the US, it was mainly anti-war,"" said Kolsbun. ""I didn't even know it meant nuclear disarmament.""

As the Vietnam War escalated in the mid-1960s, the peace symbol was adopted by anti-war protesters and the counterculture movement, finding its stereotypical place on Volkswagen buses and acid-wash T-shirts. Intentionally kept free from copyright, it traveled far and wide, appearing in the former Czechoslovakia as a symbol against Soviet invasion, and in South Africa to oppose Apartheid.

As the symbol grew in popularity, it also faced opposition. ""Some really hated (it), like the far-right group John Birch Society,"" said Kolsbun. ""They put out a monthly magazine and, in 1969, they did a story denouncing the symbol, saying that it was a sign of the devil. It ended up all over America and the New York Times picked up on it . It got so much publicity that some people still see it as satanic sign after all these years.""

Upside down

Kolsbun and Holtom corresponded in 1975, when the former was researching for a book that would eventually be published in 2008, marking the 50th anniversary of the symbol.

""He came back with a lot of good ideas and some of his personal sketches,"" Kolsbun said. ""He was a dedicated person. He knew what the game was. He was a very inventive type of guy.""

According to Kolsbun, Holtom had designed an upside down version of the original, in which the letter ""N"" was replaced by a ""U"" to signify ""unilateral"" disarmament, and he came to regret not using it.

""He preferred the inverted version,"" Kolsbun said. ""I think at the very beginning he saw it as nuclear disarmament, but as time went on I believe he felt that it should really have been universal or unilateral disarmament. That would take care of all weapons. He wanted the inverted version to appear on his tombstone, but unfortunately that didn't happen.""

In its 60-year history, the symbol has been used in support of environmental movements and women's and gay rights, as well as featuring on all sorts of merchandise. It has appeared on Moschino T-shirts, Tiffany pendants, US stamps and even Lucky Strike cigarette packs

Its legacy lives on and is continuously updated. After the 2015 Paris terror attacks, French artist Jean Jullien reimagined the design using the shape of the Eiffel Tower, creating a worldwide symbol of solidarity.

But one thing may have been lost along the way, according to Kolsbun: the original meaning.

""A lot of people still don't know what it really stands for: no nukes. Most simply believe it means 'peace.' But I think it's important to know the true meaning, because the nuclear threat hasn't gone away. It's actually stronger than ever."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180619170237-gettyimages-82664799-super-tease.jpg
ac544ed5f1864eb690814f17ba3f29eb	['Tom Morris']	2018-09-20 05:07:49+00:00	Can design solve the world's plastic problem?	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Can design solve the world's plastic problem?	1	"Written by Tom Morris, CNN

It's estimated that, since the 1950s, humanity has produced 8.3 billion tons of plastic. Almost 80% of this is sitting in landfill, or has been left to clog our seas, cities and countryside. By 2050, it is predicted plastic in the ocean will outweigh fish.

Historically, design has been a huge part of the problem, from the graphic design that lauded this miraculous material in early adverts to the product specifications that render some unrecyclable; from packaging design to industrial waste in manufacturing.

This week, the industry is taking on the problem at the London Design Festival . A series of exhibitions, talks and events will delve into the tricky -- some would say codependent -- relationship between plastic and design today.

As Caroline Till, co-founder of research agency Franklin Till, which is hosting an exhibition on sustainability throughout the week, explained: ""Plastic is a design issue. We designed our way into it and we have to design our way out of it.""

Material of the year

This year, the annual London Design Fair trade show has crowned plastic its material of the year, inspired by the number of young creative people using recycled plastic in their work. Plastic, ostensibly, can be used and reused in a continuous loop, and the ""Beyond the Chipper"" exhibition aims to highlight the best in practice.

""We decided that we would seek out the very best examples by designers who were truly treating the waste material as a new virgin material,"" said London Design Fair founder Jimmy MacDonald. The goal is to increase the desirability for things made of recycled plastic and industrial waste to prevent the endless production of new plastic.

Modern Design Review magazine editor Laura Houseley shares this aim. She has co-curated the ""Plasticscene"" exhibition, which brings together 13 designers working at the limited-edition (read: luxe) end of the design market.

""We wanted to demonstrate that objects can be made of plastic don't have to look like plastic,"" she says. ""The key point being that it is waste plastic, not virgin plastic.""

But, while the ambitions are firm, are these shows not somehow glamorizing the use of plastic -- recycled or otherwise? And isn't showing these things at a series of London-wide trade fairs, themselves bastions of plastic poles, banners, carpets, brochures, tote bags and lanyards -- slightly problematic?

""We are delighted to glamorize plastic when it's put to good use,"" said MacDonald, adding that, this year, the fair has reduced its use of nylon carpet by 40%. ""We do everything we can.""

Changing perceptions

The most ambitious efforts remain largely at grassroots level, with emerging design studios leading the way, rather than the established furniture brands that have historically been responsible for elevating the desirability of clear, clean, first-use plastic in design. The recent anti-plastic movement puts them under unique pressures.

""The new green consciousness launches new challenges to companies,"" said Lorenza Luti, marketing and retail director at the Italian plastic design manufacturer Kartell. ""It's not just a matter of creating a product that sounds green. It involves the whole manufacturing process.""

While all of their pieces are recyclable, Italian manufacturer Kartell does not use recycled plastic. Credit: Courtesy Kartell

Kartell is responsible for the cultish Ghost chair by Philippe Starck and the curvy Componibili cabinet, both as iconic as plastic design gets. Kartell will launch three chairs this week, all by Philippe Starck and all plastic.

While all of their pieces are recyclable, Kartell does not use recycled plastic. That, Luti says, will not change. ""(Recycled plastic's) final output does not guarantee the quality and perfection we want to achieve for our product,"" she explains. ""The raw material must be pure in order to have quality processing.""

This extends the ongoing problem with plastic in design. Furniture design links virgin plastic with luxury. Packaging design equates new plastic with hygiene. Can these ingrained codes be broken? A handful of brands are certainly trying.

Danish textile maker Kvadrat creates its Ace fabric , which was incorporated into the ""Plasticscene"" set, from recycled polyester. And earlier this summer, Swedish carpet manufacturer Bolon patented NoGlue , its answer to the adhesive that makes many floor coverings unrecyclable. It will be on display at the Designjunction showcase (part of the London Design Festival) this week.

""Brands are realizing there's credibility to be earned by removing plastic from their ecosystem,"" says MacDonald. ""I think the topic will be attacked from two angles. Consumers won't want it and brands will pat themselves on the back for removing it from their manufacturing.""

Once considered the least important city in the quartet of fashion capitals, London Fashion Week has transformed from a fledgling week of lesser-known designers and commercial brands into a lineup of big names, promising young designers and buzzy parties.

However, with the specter of Brexit looming and the seismic shifts in culture courtesy of the #MeToo movement, many designers are keen to express more than just sartorial propositions. In fact, many of them are using their shows and collections as canvases for bigger ideas, questioning and exploring the nuances of how women live today and how they'll want to express themselves tomorrow. Here are fiver wider conversations that emerged from the Spring-Summer 2019 shows.

Anniversaries and new beginnings

London Fashion Week was marked by a combination of anniversaries and new beginnings. Two designers, Victoria Beckham and Mary Katrantzou, celebrated a decade with landmark shows. Beckham decamped from New York to show in London for the first time, rounding off the day with a party that saw her dancing to ""Spice Up Your Life"" alongside British Vogue editor Edward Enninful. Meanwhile, Katrantzou sent out a highly embellished collection that drew on themes from her career, like trompe l'oeil, digital prints and show-stopping embroidery.

The week also marked a new dawn for Riccardo Tisci, the new creative director of Burberry. Tisci sent out a whopping 113 looks, each one a polished rendition of the classic Burberry wardrobe. Much of the womenswear adhered to a palette of beiges, browns and neutrals, while the menswear was altogether sharper and darker, inspired by Savile Row tailoring. The show finished with a parade of elegant black evening gowns that will surely find their way onto the backs of A-list stars.

The personal and political

In uncertain times as these, fashion usually responds with either escapism or realism, with provocation and protest hidden between the seams. Nicholas Kirkwood, who staged a fashion show just for his footwear, chose the latter, building a chaotic forest of computers and wires for a show inspired by the subculture of hacking. However, what really reasserted the notion of political protest was the arrival of activist Rose McGowan on the catwalk, taking off her shoes and holding them up in a powerful stance.

Elsewhere, Erdem Moralioglu , the proprietor of ultra-feminine florals, was inspired by Fanny and Stella -- better known as Frederick Park and Ernest Boulton, two Victorian cross-dressers who were charged with ""conspiring and inciting persons to commit an unnatural offense"" in 1870 and eventually acquitted.

""These were people in such a conservative time dressing to be who they felt they were,"" said Moralioglu.

The show was an imagining of what Stella and Fanny would be like if they were around today or even in the '80s, hitting up subcultural nightclubs. Leg-of-mutton sleeves, taffeta bow, chintzy florals, tea gowns with boned corsetry were reimagined in club-kid neon brights and paraded down the halls of the National Portrait Gallery's Victorian galleries. There were even a couple of boys in the show -- not that you would be able to tell.

Meanwhile, Roland Mouret, who was once known for his body-conscious creations, put forward more fluid, forgiving silhouettes inspired by the activist and Parkland shooting survivor Emma González and yonic symbolism. There were brooches and badges, which were made in collaboration with female artist Mehrnoosh Khadivi, that invoked political participation and involvement.

""This season is based upon collective women's voices,"" he said backstage. ""It's also about going towards more of an emotional situation; a bit about letting go of expectations and rethinking the rules.""

The death of the stiletto

The once-loved stiletto could be on the wane, if the majority of the shows this week were anything to go by. Take Christopher Kane's molecule-inspired sneakers in primary hues; Simone Rocha's floor-sweeping satin slip-ons with feathers lining the sole; JW Anderson's latest chubby-soled collaboration with Converse; or Nicholas Kirkwood's light-up hi-tops.

This is hardly surprising. Last year, sales of high heels dropped 12% in the US, while sales of women's sneakers jumped 37%, according to a survey by NPD Group. The simple explanation would be that women are prioritizing comfort over style, dress codes are relaxing, and the offering of comfortable shoes is becoming more sophisticated every season.

The designers who did show stilettos and high heels found their models precipitously stumbling down the catwalk, often distracting from the clothes themselves.

Modern sexuality

In the age of #MeToo and #TimesUp, designers are grappling with how to present sexuality on the catwalk. With his unapologetically slinky, sexy and short-skirted collection -- set to a fictional conversation between David Attenborough in conversation with Marilyn Monroe -- Christopher Kane made a statement about how women should feel free to dress however they please.

""These are strong women dressing for themselves,"" said Kane. ""I was brought up by strong women and I don't think that sex is anything to be ashamed of.""

Other designers echoed the sentiment: David Koma showed a line of flamenco-inspired dresses that skimmed the thigh and hugged the body, and Charlotte Knowles presented a collection of skin-tight garments secured by straps and buckles. Even Molly Goddard, the winner of this year's BFC/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund, sent out looks that showed more skin than her usual smocked babydoll dresses.

New perspectives

As the entertainment and fashion industries continue to embrace diversity -- and attempt to avoid cultural appropriation -- designers are presenting alternative perspectives to Eurocentric aesthetics. Simone Rocha's show was an ode to Chinese women in the Tang dynasty (the Irish designer's father is Chinese) and featured interpretations of paintings found in Hong Kong antique markets -- themselves imitations of 16 Century paintings of Chinese concubines. The result was a spellbinding line up of cocoon shapes with prints of paintings, Tang-inspired chiffon aprons and scarlet embroidered line paintings on white cotton dresses.

Elsewhere, at Fashion East, the incubator of emerging talent, South London designer A Sai Ta explored his Vietnamese heritage. The Central Saint Martins graduate was inspired by the mantra of Kim Phuc (better known as ""Napalm Girl"" in war photographer Nick Ut's famous image): ""Love is more powerful than any weapon."" Hence, his show was an exploration of second-generation culture and the horrors of war. There were tie-dye camouflage prints, sharp-edged military details, spices of blue dragons and Chinoiserie, monastic Buddhist drapery, and the curves of traditional Vietnamese ""ao dai"" tunic.

Supriya Lele, who staged her first standalone presentation this season, drew on her the grey space between her Indian heritage and her British upbringing. Her work is an antidote to the traditional tropes of Indian style, which usually center around Bollywood sparkle and woodblock elephant prints. Instead, it evoked the sensual drapery of the sari with layers of transparencies and crochet bralettes with subtle Indian embroidery, all seen through the lens of '90s lo-fi luxury.

""I was able to work through things that I was embarrassed of,"" explained Lele. ""Growing up, I was always very aware that we ate certain food or dressed in a certain way. Now, I'm proud of my heritage."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180918070625-10-london-fashion-week-ss19-super-tease.jpg

In front of a raucous Anfield crowd basking in their side's stellar start to the new season -- Liverpool have won all five of their English Premier League games -- Jurgen Klopp's team led 2-1 late into the match until French World Cup hero Kylian Mbappe equalized after a clever pass from Neymar.

It was PSG's first shot on target in the second half, but Brazilian Firmino, on the bench after sustaining a nasty eye injury in Saturday's 2-1 league win over Tottenham Hotspur, rifled home a right foot shot in injury time.

It was thoroughly deserved as despite the close scoreline, PSG's much-vaunted trio of Mbappe, Neymar and Edinson Cavani struggled to make an impression.

Daniel Sturridge, almost the forgotten man at Liverpool, took advantage of a rare start in place of Firmino to open the scoring with a bullet header as the home side dominated the early play.

James Milner added the second from the penalty spot after 36 minutes before Thomas Meunier pulled one back for PSG despite the suspicion of offside in the build-up.

Mo Salah had the ball in the net, but disallowed for a foul on goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, before his mistake allowed Neymar to play in Mbappe and make it 2-2.

Firmino celebrates after scoring his team's third goal against PSG.

But in the second minute of added time, Firmino struck to leave Liverpool's 100% record at the start of this season's campaign intact. The Brazilian celebrated appropriately -- by covering one eye.

'This team (PSG) is built for winning the Champions League. They have unbelievable quality,"" said Klopp as he reflected on the strength of the French side and the importance of his side's win.

""We scored wonderful goals, they were thunderballs,"" he added.

Red Star Belgrade and Napoli drew 0-0 in the other Group C game.

Daniel Sturridge scored Liverpool's first goal.

Messi hat-trick

Earlier Tuesday, Lionel Messi scored the first goal of this season's Champions League on his way to his eighth career hat-trick in the competition as Barcelona kicked off its campaign with a 4-0 rout of PSV Eindhoven in the Nou Camp.

His sublime free-kick from the edge of the area opened Barca's account in the first half after Dutch side PSV had made a bright start and might have been ahead.

The Catalan giants pulled clear in the second half after 21-year-old Ousmane Dembele's dazzling run and strike put the home side 2-0 up and effectively out of sight.

Messi connected with a lob from Ivan Rakitic to claim his second before Barcelona had Samuel Umtiti sent off for a cynical foul on Hirving Lozano.

Down to 10 men, it was of little concern to last season's Spanish double winners as Luis Suarez set up Messi for his hat-trick with a clever flick.

Lionel Messi celebrates after scoring his third goal gainst PSV Eindhoven.

Messi has also pulled one clear of Cristiano Ronaldo in the tally of Champions League hat-tricks, Ronaldo making his debut for Juventus in the competition Wednesday against Valencia after his summer move from Real Madrid.

The Argentine also maintained his incredible record of scoring in every Champions League competition since 2005, taking his overall tally to 103.

Inter strike late

In the other early kickoff, there was a fairytale return to Europe's premier club competition after an absence of seven years for Inter Milan as two late goals secured a 2-1win against Tottenham Hotspur.

Tottenham looked set to extend Inter's dismal start to the Serie A season under Luciano Spalletti as it led through a deflected effort from Christian Eriksen until the 86th minute.

But a stunning Mauro Icardi volley saw Inter draw level and with Tottenham wobbling it was Matias Vecino who added a dramatic injury-time winner as he nodded home from a corner that was the visitors failed to be cleared.

Cue pandemonium in the San Siro amid bitter disappointment for Spurs which looked in command after Eriksen's goal, but slipped to a third straight defeat after winning its opening three English Premier League games.

Inter Milan's Argentine forward Mauro Icardi (L) scored a wonderful volley.

""We dominated but of course it's so cruel,"" said manager Mauricio Pochettino.

It was also another frustrating night for World Cup leading scorer Harry Kane, his fourth game without a goal and missing an excellent first half opportunity after being played through by the influential Eriksen.

By contrast, Spalletti was delighted by their late smash and grab raid. ""That's exactly what the fans want to see,"" he said.""Icardi scored a magnificent goal. The team had a great game and really went for it in the end."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180918232621-firmino-tease-super-tease.jpg

But Poland's top judge says she's staying put	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Warsaw wants her out. But Poland's top judge says she's staying put	1	"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) Poland's most senior judge has defied controversial government reforms lowering the retirement age, vowing to remain at her post until 2020 -- unless the constitution is changed or she dies.

Malgorzata Gersdorf, the 65-year-old head of Poland's Supreme Court, told CNN that the government's judicial reforms were ""dangerous"" to democracy in a country already in ""friction"" with the rest of Europe.

Gersdorf's comments come as the European Commission on Monday decided to sue Warsaw for violating the independence of its judiciary. It's the latest step in the Commission's complex disciplinary action against Poland for breaching European Union core principles, exposing the deep unease in parts of Europe with the policies pursued by Warsaw's right-wing Law and Justice party (PiS).

As part of government reforms, the retirement age of Supreme Court judges was lowered from 70 to 65 -- a move affecting 27 of the 72 sitting judges. Not that Gersdorf is having any of it.

""I will not resign,"" she told CNN during an interview in her Warsaw office, where she has returned to work almost every day since the new laws came into effect in April. ""But I may not be able to do this honorable job,"" she added.

""In my mind, I will remain the First President of the Supreme Court until 30th April, 2020. And only changing the constitution can alter that -- or my dying,"" said the justice who had been serving a six-year term under the constitution.

Gersdorf is surrounded by supporters as she arrives for work at the Supreme Court building in July.

The judge who defied the law

Under the reforms, judges can also ask the Polish president to prolong their mandate -- something Gersdorf has previously dismissed as equal to ""subordination.""

But the PiS has said the reforms are needed to rectify an ineffective judicial system influenced by communist-era judges. The Polish government had not replied to a CNN request for comment at time of publishing.

Gersdorf, wearing a necklace bearing the word ""Konstytucja"" or ""Constitution"" was quick to dismiss the government's reasoning. ""This is fake news spread by government officials, because there are no corrupt individuals in the Supreme Court,"" she said.

""If there were any, we would have prosecutions. Nor are there any people who would have had a dark page under communism, because they would not have been admitted into the Supreme Court in the 1990s, when the court was reconstituted.""

Defying a government deadline to ask for a prolonged mandate, she turned up to work flanked by hundreds of supporters in July. ""It was wonderful,"" she recalled. ""I received beautiful flowers and there was a lot of support for my attitude.""

Gersdorf has since become something of a celebrity of the resistance movement, but admits Polish society is still ""split"" on the reforms.

Poland's chief justice, Malgorzata Gersdorf, attends a demonstration in Warsaw in July.

""There are pro-government firebrands who only listen to one side of the story, to their media. And that shows on the internet, in their verdict on my position,"" she said. ""To these people, I am a German, a sell-out, practically all that is worst,"" Gersdorf said, possibly referring to suggestions that she was unpatriotic and on the side of pro-EU Germany, rather than Poland.

""But there is a section of society which strongly supports me in my struggle for democracy and for judiciary independence, and I can see this each morning in front of the court,"" she said.

Trump praises Poland

Among those backing the Polish government, is US President Donald Trump. On Tuesday, a day after the Commission referred Warsaw to its highest court, the European Court of Justice, over its judicial reforms, Trump praised Poland in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

""In Poland, a great people are standing up for their independence, their security, and their sovereignty,"" he said. Trump made his remarks a week after saying that the US was considering placing a permanent military base in Poland and the country's president proposed naming it ""Fort Trump"" in his honor.

Poland's ally and neighbor Hungary is also facing disciplinary action from the EU for its alleged crackdown on democratic institutions. Both countries are facing punishment under Article 7 -- a disciplinary process that could ultimately lead to their suspension of voting rights from the bloc.

Europe's ideological divide

It's the first time the bloc has triggered Article 7, exposing a deepening ideological divide between a growing alliance of populist governments, and Brussels.

Gersdorf said there were some ""frictions"" between Poland and Hungary, and other European states, although she didn't go as far as to see it as a ""drifting apart.""

Of greater concern to her was the blurring of lines between the government and the judicial system in Poland.

""This is very dangerous, not only for society here and now, but also for the very ruling party, should it lose power,"" said Gersdorf.

""Because those undemocratic instruments they have created may be turned against them. And that is what really worries me -- that it may be an instrument which will take root in Poland.""

Hundreds of supporters gather at Poland's Supreme Court building in July after Gersdorf refuses to step down.

'I haven't always been so stern'

Gersdorf was ""born into a family of jurists"" and says she immensely enjoyed their legal conversations at home, deciding from an early age that she wanted to be a lawyer. After a lifetime in law, including as a professor at the University of Warsaw, Gersdorf became the First President of the Supreme Court in 2014.

Four years later, she is fighting to stay in the job she describes as the ""crowning"" moment in her career. How successful she will be, has yet to be seen."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180703192530-03-poland-protests-super-tease.jpg
3fc6b7c8e02a463fa499b2a71e794380	['Analysis Nathan Hodge']	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Vladimir Putin is not invincible	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Vladimir Putin is not invincible	1	"Moscow (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin may stride confidently on the world stage. But not all looks rosy for him at home.

On Wednesday, the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, voted unanimously to approve an amended package of pension reforms, falling in line behind a proposal by Putin to raise the country's retirement age.

But the vote didn't stop some mild forms of protest, with a number of lawmakers absenting themselves from the chamber for the vote.

Valery Rashkin, a deputy who is a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, posted a photo of party members wearing T-shirts that protested raising the pension age, in violation of the chamber's dress code.

In remarks at a rally outside parliament, Rashkin called the proposal a ""genocide"" against his fellow citizens, although he voted in favor of the amendment.

Leaving aside Rashkin's abuse of that word, the pension reform package is genuinely unpopular in Russia.

Introduced in mid-June, the bill originally proposed increasing the retirement age for women to 63 from 55, and for men to 65 from 60.

That proposal prompted a series of nationwide protests. Putin took the unusual step of addressing the nation in late August to argue for the changes, while calling for the proposed increase in the pension age for women to be changed to five years instead of eight.

JUST WATCHED Pension age raise sparks protests Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pension age raise sparks protests 02:31

Despite Putin's amendments to the bill, protests continued in cities around Russia. The popular outcry against the proposal even gave an apparent boost to the Communists: In a recent gubernatorial election in Russia's far east ern region of Primorye, a Communist candidate gave the Kremlin-backed incumbent an unexpected run for his money.

Russia's Central Election Commission annulled that vote, saying there were ""serious violations,"" but it was a reminder that the pro-Putin United Russia party is taking a hit over the pension reforms. The unusual move to annul the vote came after federal election officials identified irregularities in voting, which had prompted complaints from the Communists of vote-rigging in favor of the incumbent.

The Communists are part of what is referred to as Russia's ""systemic"" opposition: They are reliably pro-Kremlin and generally steer clear of any platform that puts them in open conflict with the ruling party. But the recent controversy over the Primorye elections showed their willingness to resort to street demonstrations, something the Kremlin is usually keen to avoid.

It now remains to be seen if the passage of the bill will drive more Russian citizens to join the country's embattled political opposition, which has no representation in the national parliament.

And Alexei Navalny, the most prominent leader of the Russian opposition, has been absent from the most recent protests: Earlier this week, he was sentenced to 20 days of detention by a Russian court for organizing protests, right after serving a 30-day administrative sentence over a similar charge.

Putin may still get his way on pension reforms. The bill appears likely to come into force after his final signature and publication in the state gazette. But Russians may prove less docile than their elected lawmakers."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161209122526-01-putin-file-t1-super-tease.jpg
04973f6aade546b682354e45b1054254	['Eric Bradner', 'Dan Merica']	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Health care takes center stage in midterms fight -- and Republicans are on the defensive	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Health care takes center stage in midterms fight -- and Republicans are on the defensive	1	"In nearly every competitive Senate, House and governor's race, Democrats are turning the issue into the focal point of their television advertising campaigns, debate strategies and stump speeches.

As a result, Republicans are having to adjust to a shifting political reality: Voters have traditionally punished the party that seeks to change the nation's health laws. For nearly a decade, that meant Democrats spent every election cycle under attack. Now, Republicans who called for the repeal of President Barack Obama's health care law -- which features some popular elements, like protections for those with pre-existing conditions -- are on the defensive.

For many GOP candidates, it's the first time they've been forced to answer for their own histories and propose their own solutions.

The American public has swung drastically in Democrats' favor on Obamacare. At this point four years ago, 48% of registered voters felt the law went too far -- but now, that's down to 36%, a new Fox News poll found. Meanwhile, a majority think it's either about right (21%) or didn't go far enough (30%). And 64% of registered voters want to see more people insured, even if doing so costs the government more money.

Seizing on the political opening, Democrats have spent nearly $125 million on TV ads focused on health care this year, compared to just $50 million in health care-focused ads from Republicans, according to the political ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG.

The pressure has left some GOP candidates spinning -- insisting that they would defend pre-existing conditions protections and lower health care costs without detailing exactly how they'd do that.

Even Republicans who haven't voted to repeal Obamacare or sued to block portions of it are under fire over health care.

In Indiana, the home to one of the most competitive races for US Senate, Republican challenger Mike Braun is airing television ads touting the health coverage offered by his own business, where he says insurance premiums have remained flat for 10 years.

But a closer look at his business casts doubt on whether a Braun-style plan would be a better deal for most Americans.

What Braun doesn't say in his ads: His company's insurance plan features a deductible of $5,000 per year for individuals and $10,000 per year for families, according to the employee handbook of Braun's auto-parts business, Meyer Distributing, obtained by CNN. High deductibles are one of Americans' chief health care complaints and are a top target for Republicans' attacks on Obamacare.

The average deductible nationally is $1,500 for single plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That means Braun's company's workers who get sick could face steeper-than-average medical bills. High deductibles are also a way to keep premiums in check. Meyer's employee handbook shows that workers pay $34.30 biweekly in premiums for themselves or $198.44 for a family. Compared to national averages, that's about $300 cheaper for the year for single workers and $550 cheaper for those whose plans cover their families in 2017, according to Kaiser. The company did not respond to a request for comment on its health insurance plans.

Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly's campaign says the high-deductible plan undercuts Braun's argument that he has better solutions to rising health insurance costs.

""Even his overhyped health care plan for his own employees is only a 'solution' if they're as wealthy as he is,"" Donnelly spokesman Will Baskin-Gerwitz said.

And Braun's campaign answered questions about his company's health care plan with an attack on Donnelly.

""While Hoosier premiums doubled and all but two insurers fled Indiana on Senator Donnelly's watch, Mike Braun delivered solutions by taking on the insurance companies, holding premiums steady for 10 years running and covering pre-existing conditions before it was cool,"" said Braun spokesman Josh Kelley.

One of the most dramatic midterm makeovers is happening in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz -- the man who once played a leading role in a 2013 government shutdown against his own party's wishes in a failed bid to repeal Obamacare -- is now defending one of its core elements.

Cruz campaigned for president in 2016 on the promise to repeal ""every single word"" of Obamacare. In early 2017, Cruz argued that Congress should repeal Obamacare immediately, and then work out a new version of health reform afterward.

Now, he says, there's one part of Obamacare he wouldn't roll back.

""You need to understand, everyone agrees we're going to protect pre-existing conditions,"" Cruz said while lambasting Obamacare for increasing insurance premiums during a debate last week.

Cruz touted his ""Consumer Freedom Amendment,"" introduced last year, which he said would have protected those with pre-existing conditions. But the bill would have created parallel markets, with insurers offering some plans that don't meet Obamacare's requirements and others that do. The prices of those that do meet the law's requirements would skyrocket, health care policy experts said at the time. Insurance companies lobbied against Cruz's proposal.

His Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, said: ""I don't know how you're going to repeal every single word of the Affordable Care Act and keep protections for pre-existing conditions.""

In Missouri, Republican attorney general Josh Hawley -- who is challenging vulnerable Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill -- attempted to address a growing political problem with a new television advertisement this week.

In the 30-second, straight-to-camera spot, Hawley says he and his wife learned their oldest son has a ""rare chronic disease"" earlier this year -- ""a pre-existing condition. We know what that's like.""

""I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions,"" Hawley says in the ad.

Wanted to share a little about my family and our journey, and my commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions — like my son #MOSen pic.twitter.com/g7u9RzN1iO — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) September 24, 2018

However, Hawley is one of 20 Republican state officials who signed onto a federal lawsuit seeking to strike down former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional. They are backed by President Donald Trump's Department of Justice, which would strike down the pre-existing conditions protections but not the whole law.

If they succeed, that would mean eliminating Obamacare's mandate that prevents insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to the 52 million non-elderly adults with pre-existing conditions.

""Nerve,"" McCaskill tweeted in response to Hawley's ad. ""He sues to wipe out the protection then 'goes to camera' to say he doesn't mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful.""

And this. Get the idea? Nerve. He sues to wipe out the protection then ""goes to camera"" to say he doesn't mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful. https://t.co/CtxeY1Y23d — Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) September 25, 2018

In a late bid to insulate Republicans on the issue, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller -- the most vulnerable GOP senator this year -- and nine other Republicans introduced a bill in August intended to keep protections for those with pre-existing conditions in place.

However, health care policy experts pointed out that while the bill would forbid insurers from rejecting or jacking up prices for those with pre-existing conditions, it would allow them to exclude coverage related to those conditions -- or base prices on factors like age, gender and occupation. And the bill hasn't stopped Heller's Democratic challenger, Rep. Jacky Rosen, from attacking him for voting in favor of the repeal effort.

Republicans have also tried to pivot away from the issue of pre-existing conditions by contrasting their positions with the growing Democratic support for single-payer health coverage.

In hammering the GOP over health care, the lawsuit could be the single most effective weapon Democrats have as November's midterm elections approach.

In at least eight gubernatorial races, Democratic candidates and their supporters have aired television ads focused on pre-existing conditions. They've used the lawsuit to target Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine, who signed onto the lawsuit and is running for governor. West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, is another Republican who has signed onto the lawsuit.

In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker's Democratic challenger, state education chief Tony Evers, last week challenged Walker to drop out of the lawsuit. In a show of how complicated the politics are for Republicans, Walker has backed the lawsuit but promised he would call a special session of the state legislature to pass a law requiring coverage for pre-existing conditions if the lawsuit is successful.

The Democratic attacks also involve previous lawsuits -- like those Michigan attorney general and gubernatorial hopeful Bill Schuette signed onto. Schuette, who promised for years to undo Obama's signature law, has this year insisted he wants to protect those with pre-existing conditions.

And they've focused on years' worth of GOP votes to repeal Obamacare.

In Florida, on Tuesday Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum released a new ad bashing his GOP opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, for voting to repeal Obamacare, charging that ""DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions."" DeSantis responded by highlighting Gillum's calls for single-payer ""Medicare for all,"" saying that Gillum is running on a plan ""that would abolish private health care for millions of Floridians.""

But, like in Indiana, Democrats haven't needed their Republican foes to sign onto the lawsuit or vote to repeal Obamacare to make health care their focal point.

In Montana, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's supporters are lambasting his GOP challenger Matt Rosendale, the state auditor, for green-lighting insurance companies' plans for rate hikes and for hiring an insurance industry lobbyist as his deputy insurance commissioner.

Rosendale responded by tweeting that the Tester camp's claims were ""LIES!!!"" and that he is ""going to protect Montanans with pre-existing conditions and deliver health care WE CAN ALL AFFORD!!!"""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180608213626-gop-obamacare-super-tease.jpg

""Regrettably, we found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election coming up in November against my administration,"" Trump said during remarks at the UN Security Council.

The President offered scant details or evidence, which came during a session meant to focus on issues of nonproliferation. He suggested the meddling attempts came as retribution for the budding trade war he has waged with Beijing.

""They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade,"" Trump said. ""We are winning on trade. We are winning at every level. We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election.""

Speaking after Trump, China's representative on the Security Council denied attempts to interfere in US elections.

""China has all along followed the principle of non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs. This is a tradition of Chinese foreign policy,"" said Wang Yi, China's State Councilor and Minister for Foreign Affairs. ""We do not and will not interfere in any countries' domestic affairs. We refuse to accept any unwarranted accusations against China, and we call upon other countries to also observe the purposes of the UN charter and not to interfere in other countries' internal affairs.""

Later Wednesday, Trump tweeted an image of a recent China Daily sponsored insert in the Iowa-based Des Moines Register newspaper, containing articles supporting Beijing's stance on the trade war.

""China is actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers, made to look like news. That's because we are beating them on Trade, opening markets, and the farmers will make a fortune when this is over!"" the US President said on his official Twitter.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2018

China Daily is a state-media publication which has regularly paid Western news organizations to publish pro-China supplements and advertisements. The US distributor of China Daily is registered as a foreign agent in the United States under the US Foreign Registration Act.

A senior administration official on Wednesday sought to further flesh out Trump's allegation that China ""has been attempting to interfere"" in the 2018 midterm elections, but offered no concrete evidence to back up the President's claim. None of the activities the official described rose to the level of Russia's coordinated campaign to influence voters in 2016 in support of Trump's candidacy.

Instead, the official lumped in longstanding practices of the Chinese government and reiterated the administration's belief that Chinese tariffs targeting regions in the US that supported the President in 2016 amount to election interference

The official described a ""whole of government approach using political, economic, commercial and informational tools to benefit the interests of the Chinese Communist Party"" and insisted that these activities ""go way beyond how normal countries interact with one another.""

""The activities have reached an unacceptable level,"" the official said on an official White House briefing call set up on condition of anonymity.

new round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods went into effect this week at Trump's order. The move escalated a standoff between the US and China, and Trump has held out the possibility of slapping additional tariffs should Beijing retaliate.

US intelligence officials have stated previously that nations like China or Iran may work to interfere in the midterm elections using a playbook established by Russia during the 2016 presidential contest.

Throughout his time in office, Trump has repeatedly downplayed Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election, which US intelligence assessments say was meant to benefit him.

He did not mention Russian interference attempts during his remarks on Wednesday and the activities described by the senior administration official several hours later did not rise to the level of Russia's actions in 2016.

The official listed other longstanding Chinese government activities without making specific connections to the midterm elections or explaining how such actions amount to election interference: ""China punishes or rewards businessmen, think tanks, movie studios, journalists, religious leaders and even political candidates depending on whether they criticize or support china's policies.""

The official said the administration is ""in the process of declassifying more information"" and said Vice President Mike Pence will outline the Chinese effort in a speech next week at the Hudson Institute.

The official insisted that the actions amount to election interference because ""some of these activities are actually covert.""

Later, departing UN headquarters, Trump insisted there is ample evidence of China's enmity toward him.

""Plenty of evidence they would like to see me not win,"" Trump said when questioned about his earlier claim Beijing is working to interfere in November midterm contests.

""First time ever they've been confronted on trade,"" Trump said. ""They can't get involved.""

Earlier this month, US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said that election meddling attempts haven't yet reached the scale of the 2016 interference efforts. But he said US agencies were actively monitoring the situation ahead of the vote.

Republicans are working to retain control of the House and Senate, through face daunting prospects with an unpopular president.

Trump has suggested previously that China would work to damage Republicans in November.

""China has openly stated that they are actively trying to impact and change our election by attacking our farmers, ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me,"" he tweeted last week. What China does not understand is that these people are great patriots and fully understand that China has been taking advantage of the United States on Trade for many years.""

Trump has vowed to add tariffs on an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods if Beijing takes steps that negatively impact agricultural or industrial workers.

88eba6de7f4541e8a08795d547e3d5d7	['Kyung Lah']	2018-09-25 00:00:00	Hints of a blue wave for Democrats in Kentucky	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Hints of a blue wave for Democrats in Kentucky	1	"Lexington, Kentucky (CNN) David Hansen tried to get the words out. ""I lost my health care,"" he began to say, his voice unexpectedly cracking, barely audible in the din of a people-packed and sweltering warehouse in Nicholasville, Kentucky. At 59, a US Navy veteran and registered Republican, Hansen lowered his head, unable to look at Democrat Amy McGrath, the congressional candidate headlining this political event in the small town outside Lexington.

A retired US Marine and a decade and a half his junior, McGrath put her hand on his shoulder.

Hansen had voted for Trump in 2016. He also voted for the Republican congressman for Kentucky's 6th Congressional District, Andy Barr. But Hansen's fortunes changed in 2017 after he had a stroke, an event so debilitating, he said, he couldn't work, losing his health care coverage. He said he now pays for outside insurance, even though he's entitled to get service from the Department of Veterans Affairs, because he said the care there is so poor.

""There's 535 people up there and they're not doing anything,"" he said of the members of the House and Senate.

Hansen's struggles illustrate why health care is among the top issues in the midterm elections, dominating political ads, particularly among Democrats, who are attacking Republicans over their efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. In August, a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS found that 81% of voters considered health care important to their vote , including nearly half (48%) who said it was ""extremely important.""

""Congress isn't doing anything,"" Hansen reiterated, frustration woven into every word. ""They need to fix the health care program because it's broken. They have to get off their high horse and just do it.""

Some of the same politically insurgent reasons he voted for Trump are why he's at a McGrath rally. ""She's not a politician,"" said Hansen, pointing out the national Democrats didn't back McGrath in the primary. ""She's also been in the military. She knows what it means to honor her commitments.""

McGrath leaned over to Hansen and said the words that sealed his support for her. ""I'm going to work very hard. That's all I can promise you.""

The issue of health care has made Hansen a Democratic voter in the upcoming midterm elections. And in this ruby red area of Kentucky, it seems he is not the only one. Indeed, there are some signs of a blue wave in a corner of the Bluegrass State.

Pushing deep

To the standing-room crowd that came to see her in a district Trump won by 16 percentage points, McGrath raised her fist in the air, punctuating her pledge to voters.

""This election is about the soul of our country,"" she said into a microphone, applause reverberating against the walls of the warehouse. ""We need to stand up and be a part of this and move our country in the direction that you know America is.

""Health care is a right for all Americans. Education is a right. I'm doing my part for my country right now. I'm doing the best that I can and I'm gonna work my ass off for you!""

Retired fighter pilot Amy McGrath says she wanted to serve her country again, this time in Congress.

People stood up, waving ""Amy McGrath"" fans and stomping their feet. Two days later, McGrath opened up rural offices in Irvine and Campton, both towns with populations of less than 2,500. Her campaign is pushing deeper into rural Kentucky than any other national Democrat has before, say local organizers, driven by the promise to protect and fix health care.

Kentucky expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, adding nearly half a million people to Medicaid rolls. Approximately 1.4 million people receive Medicaid benefits in Kentucky in 2018, about one-third of the state's population, according to the state's Cabinet for Health and Family Services. While most of the funding to cover the program comes from the federal government, state officials calculate the state's budget will be potentially $300 million short by 2020.

McGrath's daughter Ellie was only a few months old when McGrath decided to run, and is often with her at campaign events.

Along with her core issue, McGrath has a soaring and patriotic biography to impress the electorate. By age 12, she knew she wanted to fly military fighter jets, only to be told that a federal law prohibited women from combat roles. She wrote letters to members of Congress, including her own US senator, Mitch McConnell, who she said never replied. During her senior year in high school, the exclusion was lifted, and McGrath took advantage.

She graduated from the Naval Academy and flew combat missions for the US Marine Corps in both Afghanistan and Iraq. She retired as a lieutenant colonel and after the 2016 election, again felt the need to serve, this time in Congress.

She had given birth to her third child just months earlier, she had never run for office and her own party already had its own favorite : Lexington Mayor Jim Gray.

""The Democratic national party didn't really want me, if you haven't noticed,"" she said to more than one rally. ""The cool thing about that is, I don't owe them anything. I just owe you guys.""

Running with Trump

If McGrath is working to step out of the lane of her party, Barr is running to stay on pace with Trump. At the Powell County Parade, Barr stood between two banners, ""Veterans for Barr"" and ""Re-elect Congressman Andy Barr"" before leading his supporters.

Rep. Andy Barr jogged between shaking hands and talking to supporters in the Powell County Parade.

""OK, say it with me everyone. 1, 2, 3: Make America great again!"" chanted Barr. The congressman then started jogging down the parade route, smiling and shaking hand after hand, pausing often to talk to the people watching. Barr may be a three-time incumbent, but the affable, sixth-generation Kentuckian clearly enjoys the campaign.

""He's a very common person,"" said Eddie Barnes approvingly. ""He'll sit here and talk to anyone, doesn't matter if he's rich or poor,"" said Barnes, a Powell County resident and retired police officer working the parade. He's the kind of voter who has re-elected Barr twice in this formerly Democratic district and who could stomp any nascent blue wave here. ""He's a good person and we don't have a problem with him.""

On the days CNN followed Barr at campaign events, he made multiple stops, from high school students at a military academy to the Central Kentucky Right to Life Walk. His schedule was packed hour by hour, taking only Sunday off to go to church with his family.

Barr is keeping up a hectic schedule, here addressing the Central Kentucky Right to Life Walk.

At each stop, he underscored conservative values, like limiting access to abortion, and what a Democratic victory would mean to conservative ideology. ""You couldn't have a more important congressional election that will make a difference in the future of the US House of Representatives,"" said Barr at the Right to Life event. ""You have an opportunity to make a profound difference in the cause for life in November.""

Barr understands while Trump is not on the ballot, the President hangs over his race. ""There are suburban Republicans who are maybe dissatisfied with the President's personality but there's people, like in this part of the district, who are very supportive of the President,"" said Barr on the sidelines of the Powell County parade.

Expecting a good report

Veteran Donald Storm says he respects Amy McGrath's military service but he will still support Republican Andy Barr.

While health care and tariffs may hang in the balance of critical issues for Kentucky, Barr is betting conservative ideology will bring his base to the ballot box. Barr's attack ads have called McGrath ""too liberal for Kentucky,"" using audio recordings in which she calls herself a ""feminist"" and ""pro-choice.""

""There are fundamental differences between me and my opponent. I'm a conservative and she's a liberal,"" said Barr. ""At the end of the day, we trust the voters. Every two years they give us a report card and we're hearing good things,"" Barr said.

Donald Storm is one of those supportive voters. Storm is a retired major general in the Kentucky Army National Guard. While he said McGrath's service makes him proud as a fellow veteran, he added, ""Talk is cheap.""

""Andy has spent a lot of his political time and capital and his staff has helped veterans and families,"" said Storm. ""It's all about what he's done, what he's proven and where he comes down on people. I think that's going to make him a winner.""

Democrats in rural Estill County say they used to feel outnumbered, but the times are changing.

On the opposite end of the political spectrum there are those who believe the grassroots are growing, they are blue not red, and they are being boosted by McGrath.

""On most days, it feels like Republicans in Irvine outnumber Democrats 5 to 1,"" said Miller, a registered Democrat, with McGrath at the opening of a rural campaign office in Estill County. ""But not today,"" she said, as chants of ""Amy, Amy"" broke out all around."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180925141457-kentucky-voter-david-hansen-with-mcgrath-super-tease.jpg
0f6141a62b064ddabaa5141ec96b1629	['Dana Bash', 'Bridget Nolan']	2018-09-20 00:00:00	Will Democrats take the House? Watch this district. It has everything.	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Will Democrats take the House? Watch this district. It has everything.	1	"(CNN) Republican Rep. Mike Coffman is sitting in a church communicating with a group of Spanish-speaking parishioners in their native tongue with a heavy American accent.

He quietly listens to their questions, answering them slowly and methodically. The parishioners are constituents he desperately needs to vote for him if he has any chance of winning re-election in his suburban Denver seat in November.

Colorado's 6th District is the ultimate battleground. For years, Democrats have poured millions of dollars in here to try to beat Coffman, but always fall short. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won here by 9 percentage points, but Coffman still won re-election by more than 8 points.

This year, Democrats on a national level are looking to this district as a bellwether, and the party has a poster candidate for a nominee -- Jason Crow, a combat veteran. If Democrats can finally win here, strategists say, they feel confident about taking back the House.

For Republicans, the race is a test of whether an incumbent congressman who has crafted a strong personal brand in an increasingly diverse district can survive an election where the enthusiasm is clearly on the Democratic side.

So Coffman is relying on his political survival skills that have helped him win against all odds in the past. Being there for his diverse district is Coffman's calling card.

To signal a kinship with his Mexican and Salvadoran American constituents, Coffman hired a Spanish tutor, with whom he studies every Sunday for two hours. She sits with him at his event, and he turns to her when he needs a language lifeline.

The Hispanic community is just one of the large ethnic enclaves in his district, and Coffman knows it. He had just come from a visit with the Chinese community, and is next headed to an Ethiopian celebration, where he will be greeted as a rock star because of the time and effort he has spent helping combat human rights abuses in Ethiopia.

""With this President, this midterm is going to be rough for Republicans. It's those members of Congress that have established a brand in their district, that is independent of quite frankly, of the party in Washington, DC, that are going to survive this,"" Coffman told CNN in an interview here.

""They don't see me as a Republican, or they don't see me in a partisan way. They just see me as their congressman,"" Coffman said.

The Trump factor

Crow is taking every opportunity he has to tie Coffman to President Trump, whose immigration policies, chaotic approach to governing, and often crass tone has made him unpopular with key voting blocs here -- from ethnic groups to independent suburban women.

He's never run for office before, which is something he emphasizes as he goes door to door making his pitch to voters.

""I'm a first-time candidate, I've never run for anything before but I feel really strongly about the direction our country is going in,"" Crow tells Esperanza Valle, while standing on her front stoop.

He won't take PAC money and is running hard against everything Washington, even his own party leadership.

""From day one of this campaign, I've been very clear, this is about bringing the new generation of leadership to Washington to turn the page and to move us forward as a country. We have this culture of partisanship that has delivered dysfunction and lack of progress, right? And this applies for Democrats and Republicans, right?"" Crow tells us in an interview.

""I will not vote for Nancy Pelosi,"" he says.

But Crow insists he will be able to beat Coffman this year -- something previous Democratic candidates failed to do in the past four elections -- for one reason: the man in the White House.

""We live in a very different world than we lived in just two years ago. Donald Trump is President of the United States,"" Crow said flatly.

In television ads blanketing the airwaves, Democrats paint Coffman in grainy black and white footage as a Trump puppet.

Coffman has worked hard to distance himself from Trump -- on everything from immigration policies to the President's twitter tirades.

""When they were separating families on the border, I certainly was one who protested that -- against the administration -- went down to the border to see what was occurring myself with those families, and the Administration stopped that policy,"" Coffman told us.

""When the President went to Europe I did statements of support, when he talked to the Europeans. Statements of opposition when he met with Putin in private.""

But even so, he admitted, Trump is a big drag on his candidacy.

""There are people that are going to be swept up in a partisan lens, that probably there's not a whole lot I can say,"" he said.

""It's less about his policies than it is about his tone. College educated independent women, just really are offended by his tone and his mannerisms in the office. So it's baked in now."" Coffman said, with resignation in his voice.

Independents are the majority here

Maybe more than any other race this year, it is all about independents in Colorado's 6th district. The district is growing so much, so fast, they now outnumber both Democrats and Republicans here.

John and Meredith Brackney were registered Republicans, but left the party after Trump was elected, and say they're not alone.

""We personally know dozens of them, well respected Republicans [who left the GOP]. They want nothing to do with that man,"" said John Brackney.

He was a local GOP elected official in this suburban district, has known Coffman for years and is leaning towards voting for him. But he also says it's ""conceivable"" that he will not.

""The only question is, is my disappointment in the President so significant that I wanna vote all the way down the ticket against Republicans,"" Brackney said, explaining his struggle.

His wife Meredith, who has voted for both Republicans and Democrats all of her life, is surer about her approach this year.

""I'm probably voting for the Democrat. I'm hoping for a blue wave. I think we need checks and balances, and right now we don't have any. And so, I'm planning on pretty much all Democrat,"" said Meredith Brackney.

Independent voter Ann Santos says she's still undecided about whether to vote Republican or Democrat in the House race here in November, but also says her vote is really going to be a protest against President Trump.

""He is so destructive, he is so divisive,"" Santos says of the president.

She also expresses a sentiment building for years among voters -- especially independents. She is disgusted with the chaos of Washington, and wants a change, and likes the fact that Crow has never run for office before.

""That is a plus for me. 'Cause that means that he is still wanting my vote, he is very interested in what the regular person wants. I guess yeah, I think he would be more in touch with the everyday person,"" Santos said.

Same goes for Dayna Kreutzer, another independent voter here who says Coffman has done a good job for the district, but thinks it's time for fresh ideas in Washington.

""I think it's time for a change. I think we're getting too set in our ways, and we need to make changes,"" said Kreutzer.

Battle tested

First-time candidate Crow, the Democrat, plays up his military service on the campaign trail and weaves it into his narrative.

""This is a battle for the soul of America. Two very different visions of what America is about and who we will become. I learned what the soul of America is when I served with my fellow soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. When I think of America, the faces of those young men and women pop into my mind,"" Crow told a group of supporters before they fanned out to knock on doors on his behalf.

Though Coffman doesn't talk about it as much, he, too, is a veteran. He is the only member of Congress to serve in both Iraq wars, first in the Army, then the Marines.

He says he is falling back on his Marine training for much needed stamina in this political race. He tries to do 500 pushups each day and dropped and gave us 20 for our camera.

But it's his experience on the front lines of politics -- being in a neck-and-neck race in this district several times before -- that he hopes really makes a difference.

""In a bad political environment, [we] are more likely to survive than people that suddenly find themselves in headwinds that they've never experienced before,"" he told us.

Coffman calls it being ""battle tested.""

As competitive races go, Coffman believes he is doing everything he can. Republicans in Washington say he is doing everything right.

But this year, it may not be enough -- thanks to President Trump. He says it used to drive him crazy that his own fate is so tied to Trump, whom he says he did not vote for.

Now?

""You know at this point, I'm resigned to it,"" Coffman said."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180920163034-mike-coffman-naturalization-ceremony-super-tease.jpg

It was tough going for some Republican House members looking for a promotion. But it also might cause a little heartburn for Republicans who are hoping to return to the chamber, or join it for the first time.

Based on Tuesday's results, CNN is moving four races to a more competitive ranking -- all in favor of the Democrats. In three of those contests, Republicans remain strong favorites to hold the seat, but Democrats landed candidates they feel are good fits for the districts. That also is true in the fourth race on the list, which moves to the Toss-Up column. Of the 22 races now rated as Toss-Ups, 20 are currently held by Republicans.

As a reminder, Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats in order to win control of the House.

NC-09: GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger became the first incumbent to lose a renomination contest this cycle, creating an open seat opportunity for Democrats where the party had already landed a strong challenger. Democrat Dan McCready, a Marine Corps veteran and clean energy entrepreneur, received nearly 38,000 votes Tuesday -- roughly 4,000 more than Pittenger and GOP primary winner Mark Harris combined. McCready heads into the general election with $1.2 million in the bank compared to about $70,000 for Harris, a former pastor. This district went for Donald Trump by 12 points in 2016, but Democrats hold a clear edge in enthusiasm at this stage of the race. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up.

As we approach a cluttered stretch of the primary calendar, the results from those contests -- and the next wave of campaign fundraising reports in June -- will help to clarify the Democratic Party's prospects this fall.

That deadline will offer a good idea of whether Democrats can maintain momentum. More than three dozen Democratic House candidates outraised Republican incumbents for the second quarter in a row after the most recent filing.

Trump's national approval rating, meanwhile, continues to hover around 40%, which poses an additional challenge for GOP candidates running this year.

With all that in mind, we are moving a dozen Republican held House districts to a more competitive rating. Each race below is moving in the direction of the Democrats even though the Republican remains favored in all of them.

As a reminder, Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats in order to win control of the House. Of the 11 races rated Lean Democratic by CNN, seven are currently held by Republicans, as are 19 of the 21 races rated Toss-Up. Of the 25 races CNN now rates as Lean Republican, all are Republican-held -- or in the case of the Ohio 12th District seat vacated by Pat Tiberi, had been held by a Republican.

AZ-06: You might not have to look very far for reverberations from last week's special election results. The neighboring 6th District, represented by GOP Rep. Dave Schweikert, is more favorable terrain for Democrats than the 8th District -- more suburban and home to a higher percentage of college graduates. Trump won here by 10 points, a much slimmer margin than Mitt Romney's 21-point spread in 2012. Arizona has a late primary at the end of August, but Democrats believe Arizona State University nursing professor Heather Ross has the potential to make this race more competitive if she emerges as the nominee. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

AR-02: Arkansas state Rep. Clarke Tucker gives Democrats a candidate who could make inroads in the 2nd District, home to Little Rock. Tucker announced his bid in early February, and despite the late start managed to beat GOP Rep. French Hill in fundraising by about $130,000 in the first quarter. Trump won the district by 10 points, slipping from Romney's 12-point margin four years earlier. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

CA-04: There are some shared qualities with the northern Sacramento suburbs of California's 4th District and the Phoenix suburbs from Arizona's 8th District. Both have a large contingent of senior citizens. They also have a similar racial breakdown. Trump won only 53% in this district, falling off five points from Romney's 58% mark in 2012. Veteran GOP Rep. Tom McClintock has been outraised by leading Democratic candidate Jessica Morse in three consecutive fundraising quarters. Morse also has a $715,000 to $676,000 cash on hand lead. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

FL-16: GOP Rep. Vern Buchanan has won comfortably the last two cycles, and while he remains a heavy favorite he'll have to work a bit to earn a seventh term in this Sarasota-area district. He's sitting on $2.5 million in the bank and raised $480,000 in the first quarter. He'll likely face Sarasota attorney David Shapiro in November. The Democrat raised $400,000 in the first quarter and is just shy of half a million cash on hand. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

IL-14: Lauren Underwood, a registered nurse and former Department of Health and Human Services adviser in the Obama administration, scored 57% of the vote in a crowded Democratic primary last month. Democrats are hopeful she can give GOP Rep. Randy Hultgren a serious challenge in the 14th District, which is made up of Chicago exurbs. Hultgren has benefited from weakly-funded challengers in previous cycles -- a luxury he likely won't have against Underwood, who raised $465,000 in the first quarter. Hultgren brought in $360,000 -- but still has a significant cash on hand advantage ($783,000 vs. $235,000). While Trump won this district by four points in 2016, Barack Obama carried it with 50% in 2008. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

MI-01: This northern Michigan district, which includes the Upper Peninsula, went for Trump by 22 points, but gave Romney and McCain single-digit victories. The race is shaping up to be a contest between two Marine Corps veterans -- incumbent GOP Rep. Jack Bergman and Democratic candidate Matthew Morgan. Morgan has outraised Bergman in each of the past two quarters and now holds a $317,000 to $307,000 advantage in terms of cash on hand. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

NJ-03: GOP Rep. Tom MacArthur's support for Trump's agenda (health care repeal and tax cuts) and a strong challenge from likely Democratic nominee Andy Kim make this swing district competitive. The district went for Trump by six points, but backed Barack Obama by four in 2012. Kim, a former national security adviser to Obama, outraised MacArthur by more than $200,000 in the first quarter, though the Republican still holds an advantage of roughly $270,000 in cash on hand. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

NM-02: Both parties are facing primary fights in the 2nd District, which opened up when GOP Rep. Steve Pearce decided to run for governor in the Land of Enchantment. On the Republican side, it appears to be a contest between state Rep. Yvette Herrell and former Hobbs Mayor Monty Newman. Xochitl Torres Small looks to the the frontrunner for the Democratic nod. The attorney and former field representative for Sen. Tom Udall raised $313,000 in the first quarter, beating Newman and Herrell combined. While registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in this district, Trump carried it by 10 points, which was a wider margin than Romney's seven-point win in 2012. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

OH-01: All eyes in Ohio are on the 12th District special election in August, but the House race in the Buckeye State to watch in November is likely to be the 1st District, where GOP Rep. Steve Chabot could face a serious challenge from Democrat Aftab Pureval. Pureval, the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts, outraised Chabot by nearly half a million dollars in the first quarter of 2018. This district, which includes the western and northern parts of the Cincinnati metro area, went for Trump by seven points and Romney by six points. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

OH-07: Speaking of Ohio, GOP Rep. Bob Gibbs improved a bit on his lackluster $86,000 fundraising quarter at the end of 2017 -- raising $113,000 in the first quarter of 2018. Democrat Ken Harbaugh, a former Navy pilot, hauled in $441,000 -- after raising $272,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gibbs still has $1.3 million in the bank compared to Harbaugh's $726,000. The Gibbs campaign and Ohio Republicans have been attacking Harbaugh's primary opponent, Patrick Pikus, who is little known and has only raised $5,000 for his campaign -- perhaps in an attempt to raise his name ID. Democrats see the move as an indication the Gibbs campaign views Harbaugh as a threat. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

WA-05: Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the House GOP leadership, has a tough race on her hands against Democrat Lisa Brown, the former chancellor of Washington State University Spokane. A recent Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the House GOP leadership, has a tough race on her hands against Democrat Lisa Brown, the former chancellor of Washington State University Spokane. A recent poll of the district showed McMorris Rodgers leading Brown by six points, 44% to 38%, with 16% undecided. McMorris Rodgers hauled in $776,000 in the first quarter compared to $649,000 for Brown -- and the Republican leads in cash on hand by more than $700,000. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

WI-06: Even with House Speaker Paul Ryan's retirement, a lot of attention in the Badger State will be paid to the 1st District race. But the contest in the 6th District could be the best pickup opportunity in the state for Democrats, with Dan Kohl -- nephew of former Sen. Herb Kohl -- giving the party a serious challenger to GOP Rep. Glenn Grothman. Kohl has outraised Grothman now in three consecutive quarters and has $136,000 more in the bank to start April. This is another district where Trump outperformed previous Republican candidates, winning by 17 points. Romney won it by seven in 2012 while Obama carried the district in 2008. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

Barnes is a member of the CNN Decision Desk and co-author of the 2018 Almanac of American Politics.

(CNN) Republicans were relieved when Debbie Lesko won a special election on April 24 to maintain GOP control of the Phoenix area congressional seat of former Rep. Trent Franks. Lesko's 52.4%-47.6% victory over Democrat Hiral Tipirneni — based on unofficial but near complete returns — was welcomed by Capitol Hill Republicans who were panicked after Democrat Conor Lamb won a House special election in March in Pennsylvania in a congressional district which, like Arizona's 8th Congressional District outside Phoenix, President Donald Trump carried handily in 2016. Both Franks and the Rep. Tim Murphy from the Pennsylvania district had resigned in scandal.

But an analysis of the special election returns from the 143 precincts that make up the congressional district in Arizona shows that Tipirneni performed better in many of the Republican-leaning precincts in the district, relative to results from the 2016 presidential election, than in its Democratic enclaves. This suggests that Tipirneni's message that Republicans are going to cut Social Security and Medicare to fill the yawning federal budget deficits exacerbated by the 2017 GOP tax cuts hit home with independent and even some GOP voters.

While many Democratic operatives have argued that the party's fortunes in the midterm elections in November will be determined by its ability to drive partisan Democrats to the polls -- making the midterms a so-called ""base election""-- Tipirneni's performance suggests that a ""persuasion"" strategy with a message aimed at swing voters and disenchanted Republicans could also play dividends. Indeed, in GOP House seats that Hillary Clinton didn't win or even come to close carrying in 2016, a persuasion approach is probably critical.

We grouped precincts in Arizona's 8th Congressional District by the percentage of the major-party vote won by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and compared that to how Tipirneni performed in those clusters of precincts in the 2018 House special election.

Where Clinton got less than 30% of the vote in 2016, Tipernini gained 11.1 percentage points. Where Clinton got more than 50% of the vote in 2016, Tipernini ganed less than 5 percentage points.

f597790121f247e59c989c7bef7bab1b	['Terence Burlij']	2018-04-11 00:00:00	CNN Key Races: Ryan's retirement shifts his open House seat to Lean Republican while six other races move in favor of Democrats	https://www.cnn.com/	US	CNN Key Races: Ryan's retirement shifts his open House seat to Lean Republican while six other races move in favor of Democrats	1	"Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan's bombshell announcement that he will not seek re-election brings with it immediate and long-term political ramifications for his southeast Wisconsin district and the House landscape overall, where Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to gain the majority in 2019.

The most acute effect will be felt in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District, which Ryan has represented since 1999. He already was facing a potential challenge from Democrat Randy Bryce, who had raised nearly $5 million for his campaign, including $2 million in the first quarter of 2018. The district, which includes Kenosha and Ryan's hometown of Janesville, is more favorable terrain for Democrats than the southwest Pennsylvania district Conor Lamb won in the March special election.

The Republican-aligned candidate in the recent Supreme Court race in Wisconsin won this district by five percentage points, despite losing the statewide race by more than 11 points.

That GOP performance is on par with Mitt Romney's margin in the district in 2012, but less than Donald Trump's 10-point spread there in 2016.

Bryce's bid is likely to lose a little enthusiasm without Ryan's name on the ballot, but the energy this cycle is clearly on the Democratic side.

More broadly, Republicans are also losing the party's best fundraiser for House candidates. Just this Monday, Ryan's campaign announced hauling in more than $11 million in the first quarter of the year, bringing its total raised to $54 million -- and transferring more than $40 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee to help other GOP candidates this cycle.

Then there are the optics of the decision. By announcing his retirement now, it sends a dire signal to Republicans that an already tough environment could get even more challenging.

Ryan's open seat moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican, with the potential to become more competitive depending on who the GOP nominates to run in this district.

At the same time we are making a few other changes to our House race ratings.

Arizona

AZ-08: We are soon going to get yet another peek into the 2018 political landscape with an upcoming special election where Republicans are hoping the natural DNA of the district will be somewhat more resistant to the Democratic enthusiasm that toppled their candidates in Pennsylvania and Alabama.

The April 24 contest in Arizona's 8th Congressional District features Republican Debbie Lesko, a former state senator, and Democrat Hiral Tipirneni, an emergency room physician. The seat was vacated in December when GOP Rep. Trent Franks resigned amid sexual harassment allegations.

Democrats did not contest this House seat in 2016 or 2014.

At the presidential level, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 21 points in the district, which is made up primarily of the western Phoenix suburbs and chock full of retirees. Romney bested Barack Obama there by 25 points in 2012.

On the heels of Lamb's victory last month, Republicans aren't taking any chances. They've poured more than $600,000 into the race to keep it from flipping to the Democrats.

Democrats aren't nearly as bullish on this special election as they were about Pennsylvania. Republicans hold a 17-point advantage in voter registration in the district. Lesko remains a heavy favorite, but given how Democrats have overperformed in special elections the past year, this race should be closer than most would normally expect.

This race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

Ohio

OH-12: After the Arizona special election, all eyes will turn to this central Ohio district, which became open when Republican Pat Tiberi resigned in January to lead the Ohio Business Roundtable. The district is more urban than PA-18, which should make it a bit bluer. The inner ring Columbus suburbs are the kinds of places where Democrats expect to make gains this cycle. It's slightly less white than PA-18, and also a bit younger and with more college graduates. Trump got 52% of the vote here in 2012, underperforming Romney's 54% mark. There are crowded primaries on both sides, but the makeup of the district and the Democratic edge in enthusiasm mean this one is likely to get more competitive before August. This race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

Florida

FL-15: Ryan's isn't the only retirement announcement from Republicans Wednesday. Four-term Rep. Dennis Ross is leaving as well, opening up a seat in a district that includes the Tampa Suburbs -- and has the same partisan tilt on the presidential level as Ryan's district. There is a crowded Democratic primary there, with 31-year-old Navy veteran Andrew Learned holding a slight fundraising edge at this point. With Ross no longer on the ballot, this seat appears primed to become more competitive. This race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

New York

NY-11: Max Rose, a former non-profit healthcare executive and Army veteran, gives Democrats a candidate who could make inroads in this district, home to Staten Island. Rose also stands to benefit from a fractured Republican primary, with incumbent Rep. Dan Donovan running against former Rep. Michael Grimm, who served time in prison for felony tax fraud. For his part, Donovan is facing allegations he used his position to intervene in the arrest of his domestic partner's son on charges of heroin possession. This race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

Ohio

OH-14: Democrat Betsy Rader doesn't have a primary, giving her a clear shot at challenging GOP Rep. Dave Joyce in the 14th, home to the Cleveland and Akron suburbs. Like OH-12, this district has been more favorable to Democrats in previous elections than PA-18. Trump won it by 11 points in 2016, but Romney carried it by only three points in 2012. This race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

Wisconsin

WI-07: GOP Rep. Sean Duffy looks well-positioned to win re-election in northern Wisconsin, with more than $2 million in the bank at last check. But the recent state Supreme Court election in the Badger State suggests it might not be a sure thing, with a 20-point swing in favor of the Democrats from Trump's margin in 2016. Democrats think Bon Iver manager Kyle Frenette could give them a shot here. Frenette recently announced raising $250,000 in the six weeks since his campaign launched. This race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180411115022-2018-house-key-races-evergreen-super-tease.jpg

Rick Scott shook up the Senate map Monday with his decision to challenge Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.

Scott's entrance ends months of will-he-or-won't he speculation and brings a sigh of relief for Republicans, who had lacked a credible opponent for Nelson.

The Sunshine State contest is likely to be one of the most expensive in the country this year, making Scott's net worth of nearly $150 million an added benefit of his candidacy for Republicans. The Republican governor has shown a willingness to dip into his personal funds in previous races.

If Democrats are to have any hope of reclaiming the Senate majority they will need to hold onto Florida -- and most, if not all, of the other nine states with Democratic incumbents that Trump won in 2016. Republicans currently hold a 51-49 advantage in the Senate, meaning Democrats need a net gain of two seats.

Nelson, who is seeking a fourth six-year term in the Senate, started the calendar year with $8 million in the bank. He won his most recent race in 2012 by 13 points over Republican Connie Mack IV while at the same time Barack Obama carried the state by just a single point over Mitt Romney.

7cf02531bc2142bfbba29c1ddfb4d0c0	['Analysis Z. Byron Wolf With Visuals Joyce Tseng']	2018-09-21 00:00:00	This is Trump's model for losing Congress and winning re-election	https://www.cnn.com/	US	This is Trump's model for losing Congress and winning re-election	1	"(CNN) Here's a silver lining for President Donald Trump if Republicans lose either of their majorities on Capitol Hill in November: You have to go all the way back to Herbert Hoover to find a President who lost a majority in Congress during his first term and then lost re-election.

And he was dealing with a stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression. Trump's economy is humming.

The story of the 2018 midterms is not yet fully written, but if an expected blue wave ends up sweeping Democrats into the majority, there's at least one reason Trump should not despair:

Most Presidents who lose one or both houses in their first midterms go on to re-election.

Call it themodel, since he took a first-term rebuke by voters and turned it to his advantage, running for re-election by deftly attacking Congress.

""If Democrats should take back one or both houses, he could go all Harry Truman on them,"" said Barbara Perry, who is director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center.

Trump could be a master at vilifying Democrats, particularly if they take a sweeping election victory and overplay their hand, she said, using the example of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, in the 1990s.

It's hard to call rebounding from a midterm election loss -- Barack Obama called his a ""shellacking"" -- a trend, since elections happen only every two years.

But there's no denying that the last two Presidents who lost control of the House during their first terms -- Bill Clinton in 1994 and Obama in 2010 -- both went on to second terms.

Those are both Democrats, and Trump's obviously a Republican. But the point is that what happens in one midterm election certainly doesn't presage the next general election.

Each election -- quite obviously -- is unique.

When Obama's Democrats lost their majority in 2010, it was after a string of legislative accomplishments, including a massive stimulus to kick-start the economy out of the Great Recession, a Wall Street overhaul bill and the Affordable Care Act.

It was a tea party movement born of backlash to those policies -- and others that Democrats had hoped to pass, such as a cap-and-trade proposal to deal with climate change and the promise of immigration revisions -- that swept Democrats out of power.

Republicans have much slimmer majorities now than Democrats did then. Even with all levers of government under their control under Trump, they've been unable to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They did pass landmark tax legislation, but the additional money many Americans will have in their pockets has not led to a broad backlash against it.

Rather, Democrats today are more likely to vote on a visceral reaction to Trump or to protect some of those accomplishments Democrats achieved in the first two productive years of the Obama administration. Health care, notably, has played a huge role in Democrats' 2018 platform.

Interestingly, Bill Clinton's Democrats lost their majority after an equally active two years. They passed a crime bill, which has not aged and for which there is an ongoing bipartisan effort to undo aspects of. It was in that two years that the country also entered NAFTA. Trump is on the verge of a renegotiating that controversial but pivotal trade deal.

Republicans refused, for the most part, to work with Obama after taking then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's gavel. It took the GOP until 2014 to take the Senate. It was a different story for Clinton, who despite his impeachment did work with Republican majorities, triangulating legislation.

George W. Bush , rather than lose seats in his first midterm, gained them, bucking history in the wake of 9/11 and selling the war in Iraq hard in the lead-up to 2002. Their votes in favor of military action in Iraq haunted Democratic Sens. John Kerry and Hillary Clinton in their respective general election bids years later. But just like the march to war helped Bush gain politically in 2002, backlash to the American blood and treasure spent there cost him the majority in both the House and Senate four years later, in the middle of his second term.

George H.W. Bush faced a hostile Congress for his one term. Jimmy Carter lost a relatively modest 15 House and three Senate seats, but not the majority, during his midterm. But then he lost his bid for re-election. faced a hostile Congress for his one term. Ronald Reagan won the White House and Republicans took the Senate in 1980 and held it until after the 1986 midterm election in his second term.lost a relatively modest 15 House and three Senate seats, but not the majority, during his midterm. But then he lost his bid for re-election.

Before that, Democrats had maintained majorities in both chambers through a slew of presidents from both parties back to the 1950s.

Dwight Eisenhower and his vice president, Richard Nixon , are a good example of a midterm loss and general election rebound. They swept into office after the 1952 election and their Republicans seized slim majorities in both the House and Senate, only to lose them both two years later in the midst of the Red Scare and a soft economy. Eisenhower, despite a debilitating heart attack in 1955, got re-elected anyway.

So did Democrat Truman , although his first midterm came not after his election as President, but after Franklin Roosevelt had died.

Truman came into office with solid approval, but he simply was not FDR and as voters got to know him, his ratings dropped, according to Perry. Plus, after World War II, soldiers were coming home expecting jobs and housing, but both were lacking, Perry said.

Democrats also lost the House and Senate for two years after Truman took over, but despite the famous wrong newspaper headline declaring otherwise, Republican Thomas Dewey did not defeat Truman.

""He goes out on the stump in 1948 and becomes 'give 'em hell Harry,' "" Perry said. ""This is one key to how to come back from a shellacking is to turn against that Congress from the other party.""

Before Truman, during the Depression, is another long stretch of Democrats in control on Capitol Hill, with FDR in the White House. All the way back to Hoover, who as we've mentioned had serious problems. Republicans lost the House during his midterm and then the White House and the Senate two years later. But as Perry points out, the economy was in a free fall and a quarter of the country was out of work. Hoover's politics were out of step with that time.

""In the case of Hoover his ideology simply was totally out of step with what the country needed at that time,"" she said.

Woodrow Wilson lost Democratic majorities, but only in his second term. And that came just days before the end of World War I and during his attempt to create the League of Nations.

At this point we're so far from modern politics -- before the automobile and airplanes, much less the internet -- as to make these comparisons completely academic and not very helpful.

But William Howard Taft did lose a 16-year Republican majority at his midterm. He didn't win re-election. Before Taft, Theodore Roosevelt, unlike any president mentioned heretofore, served two terms (though he was elected to one; he took office after the assassination of William McKinley ) and had majorities of the same party in both houses of Congress for his entire time in the White House.

Grover Cleveland lost the majority after two years as President. But it was his second trip to the White House. He held the House during his first first term. Rutherford B. Hayes lost the Senate but not the House. James Garfield and was never actually elected. Prior to the 20th century,lost the majority after two years as President. But it was his second trip to the White House. He held the House during his first first term. Rutherford B. Hayes lost the Senate but not the House. Chester A. Arthur lost the House, but he had taken over for the murderedand was never actually elected.

Abraham Lincoln enjoyed majorities similar to both Roosevelts but the asterisk for him is that the size of the House and Senate shrank during the Civil War. Lincoln succeeded Democrat James Buchanan , an appeaser of the South who served one term and lost control of the House during his midterm, but Buchanan was not on the ballot in 1860. Trump, from the looks of things, has every intention of being there in 2020.

If he does run, and if the Republicans lose Congress in November, Trump will want to avoid the fate that befell President Benjamin Harrison after his election in 1888, in which he decisively won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote. Harrison, a Republican, lost his GOP House majority in the midterms, then lost in his bid for re-election. Harrison was defeated in 1892 by the same man he had beaten in 1888: Democrat Grover Cleveland. But for a repeat of this scenario to occur, Trump would have to lose in 2020 to ... Hillary Clinton.

Eight weeks from today, the nation will go and vote, rendering the verdict on the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency and their relative judgments of the two parties as well.

Below, four things I know about what will matter in the final eight weeks of this election cycle.

1. A Trump referendum: History -- since the Civil War -- suggests that midterm elections are almost always a referendum on the party in power . (There have been literally three exceptions in all that time.) And President Donald Trump is such a massive figure in our politics -- and in our culture -- that it's hard for me to imagine that he won't be on the minds of lots of voters (of both parties) this fall.

2. The House playing field favors Democrats: At the moment, CNN ranks 30 House races as ""toss ups""; of that 30, 28 are currently held by Republicans . There are also 11 Republican-held seats that are rated as ""leaning"" toward Democrats -- and one GOP seat (New Jersey's 2nd) where Democrats are solid favorites. That's a whole lot of Republican seats in a whole lot of jeopardy, especially when you remember that Democrats need only 23 to win back the majority.

3. The Senate playing field favors Republicans: There are 26 Democratic seats up in 2018 as compared to just nine for Republicans . Of those 26 Democratic seats, 10 are in states where President Trump won in 2016. No matter how popular -- or, in this case, unpopular -- Trump is, he remains more of a boon than a burden in places like West Virginia, Missouri and North Dakota. To win the Senate majority, Democrats need to win in places like Arizona, Tennessee and Texas. All doable. None easy.

9ef09a8f346f4f509e8e371164c38611	['Analysis Z. Byron Wolf']	2018-09-07 00:00:00	Donald Trump is floating impeachment to rev up his base. Here's why that's a stretch.	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Donald Trump is floating impeachment to rev up his base. Here's why that's a stretch.	1	"They're using the threat of impeachment to get out the vote and almost daring Democrats: Go ahead, impeach this guy.

Both President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell brought it up in recent days.

""I don't even bring it up,"" said Trump at a rally in Montana, as he launched into a riff on the subject. ""Because I view it as something that, you know, they like to use the impeach word. Impeach Trump. Maxine Waters, 'We will impeach him.' But he didn't do anything wrong. 'It doesn't matter, we will impeach him. We will impeach.' But I say, how do you impeach somebody that's doing a great job that hasn't done anything wrong?""

The President warned that impeaching him would lead to a sort of impeachment-off against successive administrations. He also issued a warning to his supporters: If you don't vote, he suggested, I'll get impeached.

""But we'll worry about that if it ever happens. But if it does happen, it's your fault, because you didn't go out to vote. OK? You didn't go out to vote. You didn't go out to vote. That's the only way it could happen. I'll be the only president in history -- they'll say what a job he's done. By the way, we're impeaching him.""

And McConnell's impeachment reference came during an interview with the conservative host Hugh Hewitt, who asked about whether a President could be indicted.

""I'm a lawyer, but not a good one. ... The Justice Department, I gather, has taken the position under a president of both parties that the appropriate remedy for presidential misbehavior is impeachment,"" McConnell told Hewitt in a taped MSNBC interview. ""I'm not an expert on this, but I hear that's the case.""

Democrats, meanwhile, have shied away from the idea. Nancy Pelosi, who really wants to be speaker of the House again, and if Democrats took control of the House, would basically have the ability to quash an impeachment effort, said last month it would only help Republicans and Trump.

""I don't think we should be talking about impeachment. I've been very clear right from the start,"" Pelosi said recently on Capitol Hill. ""On the political side I think it's a gift to the Republicans.""

The country, by the way, has inched toward favoring impeachment for Trump, but they're still a ways off from agreement.

Forty-nine percent of Americans supported beginning impeachment proceedings in an ABC News / Washington Post poll at the end of August . Democrats (75%) were strongly in favor and Republicans (82%) were strongly opposed. Independents were more evenly split.

In a CNN poll from June, 42% of Americans said Trump should be impeached. But that's about the percentage who supported impeaching Nixon in 1974 when he resigned as the House moved against him. A larger percentage support impeaching Trump now than supported impeaching Trump then. But Nixon faced a hostile Congress controlled by Democrats. Impeaching Trump would, he's right, basically require a Democratic majority and unanimity within the party. But removing him from office would take a Senate supermajority. Even if Democrats took control of the Senate in November, which is a long shot, they'd be nowhere near that 67 votes needed to remove him from office.

All of this is to say that while Trump wants to raise the specter of impeachment to fire up his base supporters before election day, we still feel a very long way away from a serious impeachment effort and it would almost certainly depend on what kind of report, if any, is released by special counsel Robert Mueller with regard to Russian campaign interference and possible collusion by Trump's campaign or something else that could fall into the ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" category.

With that important disclaimer, here's what would have to happen:

It's a complicated process

Considering how short the document is, the Constitution takes up quite a bit of space on the matter, spelling things out for the House, the Senate and the Executive in Articles I and II.

In Article I, Section 2:

The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.

In Article II, Section 3:

The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.

Judgment in Cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.

In Article II, Section 4:

The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

In plain English, that means first, there needs to be evidence that Trump committed treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors . Not just any crimes and misdemeanors, mind you. High ones. For Clinton, he was accused of perjury and obstruction of justice. For Nixon, list was longer and passed through a House committee as part of three articles. Regardless, it is an extremely broad and subjective target and there's been a lot of scholarship about exactly what it means. This country has historically shown a willingness to give its chief executive a lot of latitude. So, what next?

How would it happen?

The full House would authorize one of its committees, usually the judiciary committee, to investigate and consider impeachment, according to an overview from the Congressional Research Service

That committee conducts an investigation and draws up articles of impeachment.

They then vote in that committee on whether to refer some or all of the articles to the full House.

The Clinton impeachment trial on the Senate floor in Washington D.C. on February 12, 1999. Prompted by the Lewinsky sex scandal, the United States Senate acquitted him on February 12, 1999.

If the committee votes to impeach, they prepare a report for the full House, which then debates and votes on the articles. The House can approve some of the articles and not others. In the case of Bill Clinton, for instance, two of four articles were approved by the full House

If the full House votes for impeachment on a simple majority, the approved articles are then referred to the Senate, which conducts a trial. Chief Justice John Roberts would preside, according to the Constitution. Members of the House lead the prosecution and senators are jurors.

Senators then meet in closed session and vote on whether to convict and remove from office. A conviction requires a two-thirds majority. That's 67 senators. Sixty-seven!

Republicans control the House and Senate

Both Nixon, who wasn't actually impeached, and Clinton, who was impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate, were facing off against a hostile Congress controlled by the opposing party. So was Andrew Johnson, the Democratic vice president who succeeded Abraham Lincoln as president after his assassination and was impeached by the hostile Republicans who controlled Capitol Hill. He was acquitted too. Got that? the Senate is 0-for-2 on convicting presidents from the other political party.

Republicans -- Trump is a Republican, remember -- have a 237-193 majority in the House. That means 20 or more Republicans, depending on who is voting, would have to break ranks to impeach their Republican President.

Those numbers will obviously change after election day, and that's when you might hear Pelosi change her tune on impeachment, especially if Democrats can achieve a large majority. The smaller the majority, the less feasible impeachment would be. If Republicans keep the House, impeachment seems essentially off the table.

The House, however, is the easy part.

Republicans currently have 51 senators, so 19 of them would have to break ranks and vote to convict a Republican president, assuming all Democrats voted to do so.

Nixon, by the way, resigned before impeachment went to a vote in the full House of Representatives. In that case, most of the Republicans on the judiciary committee opposed the articles.

Republicans have not turned on Trump

There is not even a critical mass of Republicans who think there should be a special prosecutor to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Exactly zero Republicans have said anything close to supportive of impeachment. Trump is likely to be protected by his Republican allies in the Senate even if Democrats gain majorities in both houses and decided to try to impeach him.

Impeachment is extremely rare

Just 19 people -- two presidents, one senator, one secretary of war and 15 judges -- have been impeached by the House and tried in the Senate. Of those, only eight were convicted. Seven, including both impeached presidents, were acquitted. Charges were dropped against three others after they were either expelled from office or resigned.

Most officials who get to the point of impeachment would rather resign a la Nixon than face a public trial in the Senate. The US also has regular elections, including the midterms in November and Trump's planned bid for re-election in 2020. A representative or senator is more likely to be expelled from their respective body by their peers or kept from re-election by the voters.

It takes a long time

The impeachment process takes months and months. There are years of this administration in front of us, but the impeachment process would seem like an eternity in the Trump era if the current pace of news keeps up. The House first voted to consider impeaching Nixon in February 1974. The House judiciary committee didn't vote on an article of impeachment until July 24. Nixon resigned on August 8 of that year before the full House had voted.

e4116cd782bb45029c8e5e1b1cb10e99	['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']	2018-08-24 00:00:00	Jeff Sessions got a lot closer to being fired on Thursday	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Jeff Sessions got a lot closer to being fired on Thursday	1	"(CNN) For the last year, Republican senators have been adamant about one thing: President Donald Trump cannot and should not fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Here's what three Republican senators said in July 2017:

""I'm 100% behind Jeff Sessions,"" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said . ""If Jeff Sessions is fired, there will be holy hell to pay.""

Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa made clear that if Sessions was fired, he would not be willing to hold hearings on any replacement put forward by Trump.

It made sense. Sessions was, after all, one of their own -- having served in the Senate for two decades before Trump nominated him to be the nation's top law enforcement official. The Senate is among the clubbiest places on earth and Trump's repeated attacks on Sessions -- on Twitter, in media interviews, everywhere -- didn't sit well with the Alabama senator's former colleagues. In a Republican Congress rarely willing to stand up to Trump, Sessions appeared to be the exception to the rule.

Except, well, maybe not.

""The President's entitled to having an attorney general he has faith in, somebody that is qualified for the job and I think there will come a time sooner rather than later where it will be time to have a new face and a fresh voice at the Department of Justice. Clearly, Attorney General Sessions doesn't have the confidence of the President.""

Er, what? What happened to the ""holy hell""???

And, then there's Grassley -- you remember him, the one who said his committee simply had no time to consider any potential Sessions replacement for confirmation. ""When we get [Supreme Court nominee Brett] Kavanaugh done we're going to have time — anything that's in my jurisdiction that the President sends up that we have to do,"" Grassley said Thursday. ""But that's unrelated to any questions that people are floating around about Sessions right now. Because I wouldn't want to connect what I just told you about my having time with anything doing with Sessions.""

Riiiight. Unrelated. Got it.

(Worth noting: Grassley has openly feuded with Sessions over the Iowa Republican's push for criminal justice reform. On Thursday, the White House announced that effort would be tabled until after the midterm elections .)

This is, without question, goalpost-moving by the Republican-controlled Senate. And it is goalpost moving without any obvious impetus. Sessions has done nothing -- aside from opposing moving on the criminal justice reform bill -- over the past year that would disqualify him in the eyes of his former colleagues. And it's not as though Trump was super positive about Sessions a year ago and has soured on him now. In fact, Graham's ""holy hell to pay"" quote came directly after one of Trump's many Twitter attacks on Sessions.

The point here is that's nothing changed in regards to Sessions and the President. Trump remains enraged that Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation. He cannot and will not forgive his AG for that decision, which, in Trump's mind is responsible for the cloud that has hovered over his administration almost since its first moments. Sessions refuses -- even amid the neverending onslaught of Trump tweets -- to resign, essentially daring Trump to fire him.

The removal of Sessions -- whenever it comes -- is hugely fraught for Trump and Senate Republicans.

Republicans are currently trying to move Kavanaugh's confirmation through the Senate prior to the midterm elections -- to guard against the possibility that they lose the majority in November and can't get him confirmed in 2019. Democrats have protested but because of the changes in the filibuster rules first began by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, they have little recourse to stop Kavanaugh's ascension to the high court if all 51 Republicans vote for him.

The concern within Senate GOP ranks is that throwing an attorney general confirmation fight into that mix might severely complicate what they believe to be is the relative glide path that Kavanaugh is currently on.

""Do we really want to go through that kind of confirmation fight,"" Sen. John Thune, the third-ranking Republican in leadership, told Politico on Thursday . ""Is there anybody we can confirm?""

Firing Sessions would also ensure that the Russia investigation would be a major element of voters' calculations in November since Democrats would immediately seize on the removal of the AG as Trump's attempt to end the special counsel probe even as Robert Mueller appears to be creeping ever closer to Trump.

""There's no doubt he has some, some grievances,"" Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told CNN in May of Trump and Sessions . ""I don't know if they've aired them out yet, but he's not going to fire him before [the Mueller investigation] is over, nor do I think he should.""

Graham appeared to pooh-pooh that thinking on Thursday, noting that there's very little timeline for when Mueller will release his final report on Russia's interference in the 2016 election. ""Mueller is down the road,"" Graham said. ""To those who believe that the only way that you can protect Mueller is to keep Jeff Sessions as attorney general forever — I don't buy it.""

Those words from Graham have to chill Sessions. Because it seems as though Graham is talking about him in the past tense, and dismissing the one big reason why most people assumed Sessions would hang on.

8a89375283ef4648b49a6cffe22cbcc7	['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']	2018-07-30 00:00:00	House Democrats are riding high with 99 days until the midterms	https://www.cnn.com/	US	House Democrats are riding high with 99 days until the midterms	1	"Washington (CNN) The House playing field just keeps tilting toward Democrats as the November midterm election creeps ever closer.

With just 99 days left in the 2018 cycle, Democrats appear poised to retake the House majority they lost in the 2010 election, according to a new analysis by CNN's own Terence Burlij.

The math goes like this: Democrats need to net 23 Republican-controlled seats to win the majority. At the moment, CNN rates 11 Republican-held seats as ""leaning Democratic"" or worse for the GOP. Let's assume those 11 seats go for Democrats.

Now, we are down to only 12 additional pickups for Democrats to win the majority. Take a gander at the ""toss-up"" ratings in the chart above. Of the 27 seats currently rated as ""toss-ups"" by CNN, Republicans control 25 of them. If Democrats win just under half -- 12 -- of those GOP seats, they are back in the majority. (Traditionally, one party tends to win the vast majority of the ""toss-up"" races because House contests -- particularly very close ones -- tend to be heavily affected by the national mood. And the national mood typically favors one side at the end of an election.)

The other math problem for Republicans -- aside from the large amount of vulnerability they carry in seats they currently hold -- is how few opportunities they have of picking off Democratic seats. CNN rates only 13 Democratic seats as competitive at all -- with just two ""toss-ups"" and four that lean in Democrats' favor. There are zero Democratic-held seats where Republicans are currently favored.

Trump: ""Thank you very much, no.""

Vega: ""No, you don't believe that to be the case?""

Trump: ""Thank you very much everybody. We're doing very well, probably as well as anybody has ever done with Russia. There's been no President ever as tough as I have been on Russia.""

According to the President of the United States, Russia is done attacking the United States' voting process as a way to sow broader discord and doubt about Western democracies. Which is reassuring! Except that it appears to be totally and completely wrong, contradicting repeated assertions from senior members of Trump's own Cabinet that Russia views their 2016 election meddling as a giant success and is already at work in trying to influence the 2018 elections and beyond.

Just last Friday, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats made clear not only that he believes Russia to be targeting the US, but that the threat posed is real and concerning. ""The warning signs are there,"" Coats said. ""The system is blinking. It is why I believe we are at a critical point. Today, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack.""

So, yeah. And that's far from the only time that Coats -- not to mention Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- has said publicly that the threat posed by Russia is real and active. Here are a few others:

""I have to say there is more work to do,"" Pompeo told the House Foreign Affairs Committee in May. ""We have not been able to achieve deterrence, effective deterrence of some of these efforts of the Russians."" Added Pompeo: ""We are at risk in 2018 and 2020 ... we are always at risk.""

""At a minimum, we expect Russia to continue using propaganda, social media, false-flag personas, sympathetic spokespeople, and other means of influence to try to exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States,"" Coats said at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in February. ""There should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 US midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations.""

""Russian activities during 2016 election may have been aimed at one party's candidate, but as my colleague senator Rubio says frequently, in 2018 and 2020, it could be aimed at anyone, at home or abroad,"" said Republican Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr in June.

There's simply no one who is in a position to know who believes that Russia has ceased targeting the United States. In fact, everyone in a position to know -- with the exception of Trump -- believes Russia is already actively underway with significant disruption efforts aimed at the November midterm elections.

So why would Trump say something that runs directly -- and, I mean DIRECTLY -- contrary to what the entire intelligence community in this country not only believes but has said time and time again publicly?

It's possible -- I guess -- that he either misunderstood or misheard the question. But if you listen to the tape of the back-and-forth, Vega is the only person asking a question and there's not much din in the room that would have made it hard for Trump to hear.

In fact, that's the position the Trump administration took on Wednesday afternoon, in the wake of Trump's comments. ""The President was saying 'no' to answering questions,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. ""We are certainly taking steps so they can't do it again,"" she added in reference to Russian election interference. ""We believe that the threat still exists.""

It's much more likely that Trump said Russia isn't targeting the US because it's what he wants to believe. Remember that he spent the last 48 hours -- and, really, the last 18 months as President -- ignoring or playing down the intelligence findings that Russia meddled in the 2016 election for the purpose of helping Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton. So it's not all that much of a stretch for Trump to say that Russia isn't targeting the US anymore either.

For Trump, ""Russian interference"" = ""I didn't win fair and square."" And he can't take that. He simply will not de-couple the proven fact of Russian meddling in the election from his own insecurities about winning the White House without anyone's help or aid. Asking anything about Russia targeting -- either past, present or future -- is like waving a red cape in front of a bull. Trump can't resist charging it. It's Pavlovian.

But that's no excuse. Coming off a disastrous news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday -- and an equally botched clean-up of that news conference -- Trump is, yet again, publicly disagreeing with the findings of his intelligence community as it relates to Russia's strategic initiatives to undermine American democracy.

It's easy to lump this in with all of the other abnormal things Trump does each and every day in the White House. But this is a very big deal. And it's a pattern of behavior. Trump just keeps making excuses for Russia and finding ways to undermine what his own intelligence agencies are telling him about the threat posed by Putin and his country. Don't underplay that. It's a big, big, big problem."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180718121905-02-trump-cabinet-meeting-0718-super-tease.jpg

After all, the court decided not to decide -- refusing to even consider the question as to whether maps drawn by Democrats in Maryland and Republicans in Wisconsin were unfairly drawn. Instead, Chief Justice John Roberts sent the question back to the lower courts to allow for further consideration.

But before you look away from this story, remember the words of the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre: ""I can always choose, but I must know that if I do not choose, that is still a choice."" And the Supreme Court's decision to not set a standard for what a too-political redistricting map looks like has considerable consequences -- raising the stakes for Democrats in the coming 2018 election.

In November, there are 36 gubernatorial races on the ballot -- 26 of which states are currently controlled by Republicans including massive (and massively important) battleground states like Florida and Ohio. Win in November, and you are in office through (at least) 2022.

In virtually all of those states, the governor has a vote -- or a veto -- on whatever map the state legislature produces following the next census in 2020 and the redistricting of the country's congressional (and state legislative) lines that follows. Currently, Republicans have total control -- governor's mansion and both chambers of the state legislature -- in 25 of the 50 states, according to statistics maintained by the National Conference of State Legislators . Democrats have total control in just seven. Another 17 are split control, with one party in control of the governorship and the other with a majority in at least one of the state legislative bodies.

0b170db9af7e452492e405800a618eed	['Saba Hamedy']	2018-05-27 00:00:00	Inside Funny or Die and Billy Eichner's plan to 'Glam Up The Midterms'	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Inside Funny or Die and Billy Eichner's plan to 'Glam Up The Midterms'	1	"Washington (CNN) For years, comedian Billy Eichner has been known for screaming at people about pop culture on the streets of New York for his show ""Billy on the Street.""

Now, he wants to yell at people about something else: politics.

""I've been shouting about silly things -- actors, Oscars, thing I've always cared about,"" he told CNN in a recent interview. ""But I want to use my voice to shout at people about more significant things.""

Enter Funny or Die -- Will Ferrell and Adam McKay's 11-year-old comedy website that is home to viral videos including Zach Galifianakis' show ""Between Two Ferns"" (which famously had former President Barack Obama on as a guest in 2014). Eichner has a history with the digital comedy brand, which helped launch ""Billy on the Street"" and subsequently elevated his career.

So it came as no surprise in February of this year when the website announced it is partnering with Eichner yet again. This time for ""Glam Up The Midterms,"" an effort to bring awareness to voting in the midterm elections across the country.

""Get ready for the hottest event of the year,"" Eichner says in the promo video. ""No, it's not the Grammys, the Oscars, or the Golden Globes. It's the 2018 midterm elections.""

TONIGHT join me, @JimmyKimmel and many more of your favorites as we GET OUT THE VOTE and GLAM UP THE MIDTERMS! Help us!!! Sign up now and join the party: https://t.co/ahkVPrVrh4 #Oscars pic.twitter.com/1jhGmMYrmC — billy eichner (@billyeichner) March 5, 2018

As November approaches, Eichner's mission is to reach as many people across the US as possible, one event at a time -- with help from celebrities (such as Sarah Silverman, Jimmy Kimmel, John Oliver and Chelsea Handler) and people Eichner described as ""hometown heroes,"" local activists and leaders from across the US.

Funny or Die kicked off its midterms initiative with two events in California: one in April in San Diego, featuring Ron Burgundy, Ferrell's infamous ""Anchorman"" character; and one in May in Los Angeles, at RuPaul's annual ""DragCon.""

The plan is to hit the road this summer, and go to districts with the most competitive races to encourage people from both sides of the aisle to get to the polls.

""I wanted to take something that feels like or sounds like a chore or a test you take in school -- the midterms -- and turn it into people and make it something hot, the sexiest event of the year,"" Eichner said. ""That's a joke, obviously -- but that's our way with having fun of what can be traditionally a very dry, chore-like process.""

Inspired by a tweet

Eichner said he found himself becoming more vocal in the aftermath of the 2016 election.

conan billy eichner game of thrones_00023802.jpg

""As horrendous as I knew Trump would be, what's truly remarkable is that he's somehow worse than I thought,"" Eichner tweeted in March of 2017, one of many of his tweets criticizing the President.

Ironically, it was a tweet from President Donald Trump that inspired Eichner's idea to launch a political initiative.

""I honestly do not recall exactly what tweet it was because there were so many tweets to make you angry,"" Eichner said. ""But in that moment [in the summer of 2017], I called Mike Farah, the CEO of Funny or Die. I said, 'I think we should join forces and do something related to upcoming midterm elections, because all the tweeting and marching is great and nothing really means as much as voting, in terms of trying to get the country back on track.'""

Then the brainstorming began.

Funny or Die's political aspirations

Obama's appearance on ""Between Two Ferns"" in 2014 wasn't the first time Funny or Die had ventured into politics.

In 2008, the site debuted ""Prop 8 -- The Musical,"" starring Jack Black, Neil Patrick Harris, Margaret Cho and others, which poked fun at the California ballot initiative that prohibited gay marriage.

A few years later, in 2013, Funny or Die enlisted the help of Alyssa Milano to make a "" sextape ,"" which was actually a video created to educate the public about chemical attacks happening in Syria.

However, following the viral success of Obama and Galifianakis' interview, it became apparent to executives at Funny or Die that politically geared comedy videos have a place on the internet, and that politicians could benefit from doing this type of content, too.

fod between two ferns obama preview_00001907.jpg

""When that episode of 'Between Two Ferns' came out, it was a huge game changer on both sides. We realized we could be doing this kind of stuff all the time,"" Brad Jenkins, an Obama administration alum who was poached by Funny or Die in 2015, told CNN. ""We could be working with nonprofits, foundations, political campaigns, institutions ... and the best comedy writers in the country.""

Funny or Die hired Jenkins, who served as associate director in the White House Office of Public Engagement, in hopes of building the company's brand in Washington. In 2016, the company also brought on David Litt, one of Obama's speechwriters.

Since then, Funny or Die's small DC operation has worked with people and organizations from both sides of the aisle to brainstorm and produce lighthearted, politically centric videos to promote political engagement.

Jenkins said he and Eichner looked at data to see what types of initiatives could be most helpful around midterms. The verdict? Homing in on younger people, from both sides of the aisle, who are maybe less tuned in to politics.

""We started talking about how no young person votes in midterms. It's really bad,"" Jenkins said. ""But it's a whole new universe right now, and we don't even know who's going to be inspired and fired up to vote. Young people may completely surprise us this cycle and outvote a lot of different demographics. We're going to do everything we can in a strategic way to focus on races that matter and people who have never voted in midterms before.""

""Glam up the Midterms"" also serves as a test for the types of initiatives Funny or Die may want to tackle in 2020, Jenkins said.

Kicking off in California

And of course, grassroots voter outreach operations have long been part of each political cycle. Earlier this year, Women's March organizers launched their own midterms initiative ""Power to the Polls.""

But both Eichner and Jenkins acknowledged they don't want to be atypical Hollywood types who infiltrate small towns and tell voters what they should believe.

And while Eichner himself is not a fan of the Trump administration, he emphasized that ""Glam Up The Midterms,"" like Funny or Die, is nonpartisan.

For its first two events, Funny or Die teamed up with Headcount, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works to promote participation in democracy by signing people up to vote at large events such as music festivals.

The San Diego event took place at Oceanside High School Performing Arts Center, and featured a conversation about the upcoming primary in California's 49th District, where Republican Rep. Darrell Issa's seat is up for grabs.

""The event we did in Issa's district we brought Will Ferrell there -- but in order to come to event you had to sign up for election alerts and commit to voting in the primary,"" Jenkins said. ""With our little event we had close to 5,000 people to sign up to vote in that primary.""

Billy Eichner and Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) ""Glam Up The Midterms"" at Oceanside High School Performing Arts Center, a conversation about the upcoming primary in CA-49 as part of Funny Or Die and Billy Eichner's ""Glam Up The Midterms"" non-partisan campaign to encourage and energize young people to vote on April 12, 2018 in Oceanside, California.

03a720a03fdc4745bd741df1f9ecee82	['Analysis Ronald Brownstein']	2018-09-18 00:00:00	A Republican stronghold has become ground zero in 2018	https://www.cnn.com/	US	A Republican stronghold has become ground zero in 2018	1	"Huntington Beach, California (CNN) After the bus carrying Democratic gubernatorial nominee Gavin Newsom had pulled away, and the sound system was disassembled and the folding chairs collected, dozens of people remained behind following a Democratic rally under brilliant sunshine at a school here Saturday afternoon.

Surrounded by yard signs and flyers, they created an excited buzz in a meeting room inside the school building. Some stood in a semicircle around a young field organizer providing instructions on how to conduct door-to-door canvasses for Harley Rouda, the Democrat challenging longtime Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher. Others signed sheets to volunteer for local candidates for the State Senate, State Assembly and county sheriff. The largest group sat at tables in the center of the room handwriting postcards to targeted voters urging them to turn out in November.

Debra Valle, who relocated to Orange County from Michigan, sat behind a small pile of completed postcards. ""We have been working for the Democratic Party since I moved here in 1985, and I usually felt I was out there alone,"" she said looking around the bustling room, as her husband, Tom Beck, stood over her shoulder. ""So this feels great.""

Target: Orange County

After years of neglect, Democrats are mounting their most serious effort in memory to crack Orange County, a vast (3.2 million population) and sprawling suburban county southwest of Los Angeles. Once a symbol of unbending conservatism and white racial backlash, Orange County has grown more competitive in presidential elections over the past decade, but Democrats have made strikingly few inroads in down-ballot races, from the US House to the state Legislature, county board of supervisors and city councils.

This year, Democrats are betting that constant turmoil surrounding President Donald Trump will allow them to establish their first real beachhead here. At the top of their target list are four Republican-held US House districts in the county that voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016.

""We have a chance to step up and step in, and repudiate Donald Trump and Trumpism,"" Newsom declared to ringing applause at a crowded rally later Saturday afternoon for Katie Porter, the Democrat challenging Republican Rep. Mimi Walters in nearby Irvine. At another point Newsom insisted: ""Orange is the new blue.""

The evolving nature of the 2018 electoral battlefield is quickly raising the stakes for Democrats in proving him right: Indeed, Orange County may be rapidly transitioning from an afterthought to a necessity for Democrats.

The most recent round of national polling has presented Democrats with an almost unbroken procession of good news: Amid the legal setbacks for former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the stories of internal White House chaos, roughly half a dozen surveys have found Trump's approval rating falling to 40% or below and Democrats opening a generally double-digit lead when voters are asked which party they intend to support for Congress in November. The latest CNN/SSRS poll was typical: It showed Trump's approval skidding to 36 percent and Democrats opening a 10-percentage-point advantage on the so-called ""generic ballot"" test.

Trump's core stays loyal

But those overall results obscured a starkly bifurcated situation. In the national CNN poll, Democrats enjoyed big advantages among nonwhite voters and benefited from a pronounced recoil from Trump among college-educated whites. Though exit polls had showed Republicans carrying those upscale whites by double-digit margins in the 2010 and 2014 congressional elections, the CNN survey found they preferred Democrats for Congress by 22 percentage points.

But Trump's core constituency of white voters without college degrees still preferred Republicans over Democrats for Congress by a resounding 57% to 38%. That strong tilt has been reconfirmed by the array of district-level House polls recently released by both Monmouth College and The New York Times in partnership with Siena College . Over the past few weeks, those two polling efforts have surveyed about 20 congressional districts in all parts of the country. Neither has found any Democratic House candidate leading among white voters without college degrees; only about a third of the polls found Democrats capturing even 40% of the vote among those blue-collar whites.

Both the national and district polls show some erosion for Trump, even in these blue-collar places, particularly among working-class white women. That's opened opportunities for Democrats in a few blue-collar and non-urban seats, including districts in Iowa, Illinois and upstate New York. (Democrats are also generally showing more strength with blue-collar whites in both governor and Senate races in the key Rust Belt battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.) But Trump's residual strength with blue-collar and rural whites suggests that Democrats may still struggle to capture more than a handful of seats dominated by such voters.

That increases the pressure on them to maximize their gains in white-collar suburban seats that have traditionally leaned Republican, including those in Orange County. ""If Democrats aren't capitalizing on these California seats, and specifically the Orange County seats, then we've got a real problem,"" says Andrew Baumann, the pollster for Porter. ""If the wave is forming like we think it is going to form, we need to be winning these seats.""

Orange County's evolution into a battleground reflects both its own changes and the shifts in the two parties' electoral coalitions. In Ronald Reagan's re-election in 1984, he carried fully three-fourths of the vote here; as recently as 2004, George W. Bush won exactly three-fifths.

4 key districts

Democrats have improved their position since former President Barack Obama came close in both his races and Clinton carried it in 2016, becoming the first Democrat to do so since Franklin Roosevelt in 1936. They advanced on the same two currents that have carried white-collar suburbs toward Democrats all across the country: growing diversity (whites now compose only about 40% of county residents, about half their level in 1980) and improving performance among college-educated white voters, who are often right of center on fiscal issues but generally lean left on social issues.

But despite Clinton's breakthrough, Democrats failed to dislodge any of the four House Republicans holding seats in the county: Walters in Irvine, Rohrabacher in a coastal district, Ed Royce in an inland seat centered on Fullerton and Darrell Issa in a seat that straddles the southern Orange County/northern San Diego County border. Among them only Issa even faced a close race; none of the other three Democratic nominees spent even $100,000.

Good news, bad news for Democrats

This time Democrats have found strong candidates against the two Republican incumbents seeking re-election: Porter, the liberal and fiery University of California at Irvine law professor who is challenging Walters, and Harley Rouda, the more subdued former Republican entrepreneur running against Rohrabacher. With Issa and Royce retiring, Democrats have nominated environmental attorney Mike Levin for the former seat and Gil Cisneros, a lottery winner and Navy veteran, for the latter.

Money is cascading onto these four Democratic challengers, including from gilded Los Angeles liberal fundraisers who usually focus only on national politics.

""I have never seen this level of activity from the donor community around House races,"" says Andy Spahn, a longtime leading liberal fundraiser in Los Angeles. ""People are writing and raising for House candidates with presidential election enthusiasm.""

As the turnout after the Newsom-headlined rally in Huntington Beach showed, volunteer activity is also way up. And the OC House candidates are receiving unprecedented attention from party leaders: One week before Newsom, who's cruising to election as governor, held rallies with Rouda and Porter here, Obama chose Orange County for his first campaign trail event of 2018

But even with all this energy, several yellow lights are still blinking at Democrats here. One was the result of the June primary. Compared with 2014, the last midterm election, Democrats roughly tripled their turnout in the Royce and Walters districts, and increased it by a factor of about 2.5 in the Rohrabacher and Issa districts. Those were stunning gains. But the Republican candidates still received more votes than the Democratic contenders in all of those districts except the Issa seat.

Analysts note that the Democratic vote share is almost always higher in November than the June primary, but those results were a reminder of how deep the GOP DNA runs in these districts. Darry Sragow, publisher of the nonpartisan California Target Book, points out that since the new district lines were established in 2012, Democrats haven't carried any of the four Orange County US House districts in any races other than Clinton's victory, including state legislative contests and the 2014 gubernatorial race, when Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown romped statewide.

Sragow says that means enhanced Democratic enthusiasm alone won't be enough to tip these seats; that will require persuading independents and some Republicans too.

""It doesn't matter how much Democrats increase turnout in a district if there are not enough of them to outnumber the Republicans. And, based on election results for 2012, 2014 and 2016, an increase in Dem turnout, if it happens, is unlikely to produce a Democratic victory without more (gains with other groups),"" Sragow noted in an email.

Another challenge for Democrats is minorities. They represent a large share of the vote in each of the four districts, but mobilizing them -- especially in a midterm election -- remains a challenge for the party: Nonwhite (and especially Hispanic) faces were conspicuously rare at both rallies Newsom headlined on Saturday. The county's large Asian-American population has also voted more heavily Republican than in most places: For the open Royce seat, Republicans have nominated Young Kim, a Korean-American former State Assembly member who both sides consider a formidable candidate.

And Republicans still have some powerful arguments to wield at the college-educated whites who have been drifting away from them. Most powerful may be opposition to a state gas tax that the party is seeking to repeal through an initiative this fall; though some of the Democratic House candidates have renounced it, the GOP is confident the issue will help them paint the Democrats as tax-and-spend liberals.

""Orange County may be more purple, but when you look at the college-educated whites they still fricking hate taxes,"" says GOP consultant John Thomas, who works extensively there.

The tide against Trump

But all of these Republican defenses could get swept away if the tide of discontent with Trump rises too high, Thomas acknowledges. His own polling suggests a significant drop in support for the President in the county since June. As elsewhere, Thomas says, Trump is holding support among working-class whites, but he's ""hemorrhaging with white-collar whites."" Says David Jacobson, a Democratic consultant working with Rouda: ""I think people are underestimating how toxic Donald Trump is.""

Trump's erosion has encouraged Democrats to challenge him more directly. While many Democratic challengers in competitive seats have been downplaying the President, Porter declares flatly in her ads that she will ""stand up to Trump"" and relentlessly highlights Walters' record of voting with the President on almost every issue. Even Rouda, who stresses his determination to work across party lines, drew his loudest applause at Saturday's rally by insisting that the biggest reason to replace Rohrabacher is his recent declaration that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should resign because he was not sufficiently loyal to Trump.

""We talk a lot about single issues, whether it's gun violence, health care, immigration, the environment, middle-class jobs shrinking,"" Rouda said in an interview. ""All are very important. But what we're seeing really happen the last 60 to 90 days is (more focus on) this greater overarching issue about the threats to our democracy.""

Strategists in both parties rank the four races in roughly the same order. Both sides agree that Democrats are best positioned to win the Issa seat (with Levin), and Rouda is slightly favored to oust Rohrabacher. The open Royce seat looks like a pure toss-up between Cisneros and Young, while the low-key but staunchly conservative Walters will be toughest for Democrats to beat, though hardly out of reach for Porter, especially if Trump's local standing doesn't improve.

CNN rates all the seats as Toss Up, except the one being vacated by Issa, which is rated Lean Democratic.

""If Trump can grow by 3 to 5 points in his approval (rating) between now and Election Day those seats can hold,"" predicts Thomas, the GOP consultant. ""If he doesn't, my only clients winning will be the nonpartisan races out there."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180917131609-02-gavin-newsom-super-tease.jpg
b1934ecd26e144b88c26ad3ce9c2abf6	['Analysis Ronald Brownstein']	2018-08-07 00:00:00	Trump may not be enough to swing Latino turnout Democrats' way	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Trump may not be enough to swing Latino turnout Democrats' way	1	"(CNN) Democrats have hit an unexpected speed bump in their drive to regain control of Congress: unsettling signs that the party may not generate as much turnout or support among Latino voters this fall as it expected.

Despite a procession of provocations from President Donald Trump -- from ending deportation protections for so-called ""Dreamers,"" young immigrants brought to the country illegally by their parents, to his now-terminated policy that resulted in children being separated from their undocumented parents at the border -- a growing number of Democratic strategists are privately concerned that their candidates are not consolidating Latino support as much as they anticipated in several key races.

While cautioning that there is still time to reverse the trend, they point to signs of wavering Hispanic support and engagement in House districts in Texas, Nevada, Florida and California, and in Senate races in Texas, Nevada, Florida and Arizona.

""I still think it's a little too soon to push the panic button, but having said that, we are not seeing the types of numbers with Hispanic voters that we should be seeing with the most hostile person to ever hold public office against Hispanics as the President,"" said Fernand Amandi, principal at Bendixen & Amandi International, a Democratic polling firm that specializes in studying Latino voters. ""And that in and of itself is a concern. I'm flabbergasted.""

Private Democratic polling has found surprisingly lackluster results among Hispanics in such House races as the San Antonio-area House seat, where Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones is facing Republican Rep. Will Hurd; the exurban Los Angeles seat that Republican Rep. Steve Knight is defending against Democrat Katie Hill; and the battle in Orange County, California, for the open seat being vacated by Republican Rep. Darrell Issa.

Not all Democratic strategists see cause for alarm. Latino Decisions, another Democratic polling firm that specializes in Latino voters, and Stanley B. Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster, have each recently released separate surveys for Democratic organizations that find the party maintaining a healthy lead over Republicans when Hispanics are asked which party they intend to support in House elections.

Yet virtually everyone on both sides of this Democratic debate agrees on one point: Despite all his confrontational rhetoric and policies, Trump alone appears unlikely to reverse the usual falloff in Hispanic turnout during midterm elections, and he may not even widen the typical Democratic advantage among them in their vote preferences.

Neither public polls nor private research suggests an organic surge to the polls among Hispanic voters outraged by Trump is developing the way it appears to be coalescing among college-educated white women and African-American women. And that means Democrats face their typical challenge of energizing a community whose voter participation has remained stubbornly low.

""I think that the turnout is not guaranteed and all of the candidates and the interest groups have a lot of work to do,"" said Matt Barreto, co-founder and managing partner of Latino Decisions. ""They don't want the anger to sit there and fester and turn into so much frustration that people don't feel that there is anything they can do.""

From Florida to California

The alarms among Democrats over Hispanic intentions have been triggered partly by a series of recent public polls showing their candidates underperforming with those voters in several key races.

The findings start in Florida, where a recent Mason-Dixon survey showed Hispanics providing Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson only a narrow 44 percent to 39 percent lead over Republican Rick Scott. Republicans typically run better among Hispanics in Florida than elsewhere, because the state's large Cuban population has historically tilted right.

But Democrats have been improving because of their strength among Florida's growing Puerto Rican community, which has swelled again in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Exit polls found that Hillary Clinton beat Trump among the state's Hispanic voters by 27 percentage points in 2016. Yet Scott's aggressive outreach to the community has raised fears among Democrats that Nelson won't nearly match that margin with Latinos.

Several Texas polls have also shown surprisingly modest advantages for Democrat Beto O'Rourke over Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The most recent Quinnipiac Poll gave O'Rourke just a 12-percentage-point lead over Cruz among Latinos. The nonpartisan Texas Lyceum Poll gave O'Rourke a comparable 15-point lead among all registered Latinos and a wider, but still subpar, 19-point lead among the Latinos the survey deemed likely to vote.

Joshua Blank, manager of polling and research at the University of Texas at Austin's Texas Politics Project, says that while most Texas Latinos support Democrats, there's no evidence yet that Trump's agenda is prompting much defection among the significant minority of them who consistently back Republicans.

""The reality is there are about one-third of Texas Hispanics who hold relatively restrictionist attitudes on immigration, support Republican positions, support Republican candidates ... and they were doing that while (Republican) politicians in this state were spending $800 million on border security and trying to pass sanctuary city laws with 'show me your papers' provisions,"" Blank said. ""It's not that Trump comes along and Texas Hispanics are saying: 'What's going on here?' It's what has been going on here, and they have already arrived at those opinions.""

In a third key Senate race, a public poll in Arizona , from OH Predictive Insights and the local ABC channel, found Democratic Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema underperforming among Latinos against her most likely Republican opponent, Rep. Martha McSally. The survey actually found McSally leading with those voters, though few in either party consider that a possibility on Election Day, and OH Predictive Insights, which conducted the poll, cautions that the margin of error among Latino voters is high because the sample is small. Even so, some Democrats privately worry that Sinema has focused too much on convincing center-right white voters that she is concerned about border security and not enough on persuading Latinos she will defend their interests.

Also raising some eyebrows: The most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll put Trump's approval among Latinos at 39 percent, well above his 28 percent share of the vote among them in 2016, according to exit polls.

Some Latino activists have long viewed public polls of their community -- including exit polls -- as unreliable and contended they tend to underrepresent respondents who speak mostly Spanish, a group that leans more toward Democrats. And other surveys show less reason for Democratic concern.

The most recent national Quinnipiac University poll, for instance, put Trump's Latino approval at 27 percent -- almost exactly equal to his vote among them -- and in Monday's weekly Gallup average, just 23 percent of Latinos approved. A recent Latino Decisions poll in 61 competitive House districts, conducted for a consortium of civil rights advocacy groups, found Democrats holding a roughly 40-percentage-point advantage among Latino voters.

Trump is 'in the strongman tradition'

Amandi says that despite these mixed signals in polling, he sees evidence that Trump and the GOP have maintained a beachhead of support among Latinos.

""My instant analysis is it's because of the economy,"" he says. ""These are people who are not necessarily paying attention to every inning of political baseball. They are working. They are maybe getting a little bit more money.""

Moreover, Amandi says, even Trump's belligerent style has found an audience among some Latinos, especially older men: ""He's in the strongman tradition of the Latin American caudillo.""

Yet Barreto's poll for the coalition of civil rights groups still found that about three-fourths of Latinos opposed both the border wall and Trump's now-abandoned ""zero tolerance"" policy and nearly 90 percent supported legal status for the ""Dreamers."" Barreto says the only reason Republican performance among Latinos might look relatively stronger in current surveys -- or on Election Day itself -- is if turnout among them remains low. The reason is that Latinos who lean Republican also tend to be older -- and thus more reliable voters in low-turnout elections.

""I have not seen any data that I would consider an accurate reflection of Latinos that Republicans are increasing (their share), or they will be over 25 percent of those voters,"" Barreto says. ""The only reason it would be different is not that they are winning over more people; it would be if some Latinos who are Democratically leaning stay home.""

Recent history offers evidence for that argument. In the House races during the low-turnout midterm elections of 2010 and 2014, Republicans won a higher share of Latino voters -- 38 percent and 36 percent, respectively -- than they did in House contests during the higher-turnout presidential years of 2016, 2012 and 2008 (from 30 to 32 percent), according to exit polls.

What about turnout?

That contrast highlights what remains the biggest concern about Latinos among Democratic strategists: Will they vote in sufficient numbers? In the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, Latino turnout plummeted from its levels in the presidential elections just two years earlier: While about half of eligible Latinos voted in each of those presidential elections, a low number to begin with, the figure fell to under one-third in 2010 and a little over one-fourth in 2014.

Turnout among Latinos remained essentially stagnant at just under 50 percent in 2016 despite all of Trump's harsh rhetoric at the community. Barreto says his survey found a high level of anger at Trump among Latinos, especially younger generations, and he argues that anger has been a good predictor of heightened turnout. On the other hand, public surveys measuring how closely voters are following the election and whether they are certain to vote have mostly found Latinos still lagging other groups.

Poring over such ambiguous evidence, Henry Fernandez, a principal at the African American Research Collaborative, which studies issues relating to black voters, says the direction of Latino turnout this fall is not yet clear.

He says the increased Republican reliance on racially confrontational messages in the Trump era -- such as comments about the Central American gang MS-13 during the Virginia governor's race last fall -- has clearly prompted a backlash among African-American voters, who ""respond most strongly"" to any political argument that targets racial divisions, even if they are not the direct subject of the attacks.

Even though the MS-13 attacks failed to lift Republican Ed Gillespie during the Virginia race, the barrage of ads in Tuesday's Ohio special House election accusing Democrat Danny O'Connor of supporting ""amnesty for illegals"" and ""open borders"" makes clear that Republicans are committed to stressing racially infused immigration themes through the fall.

Whether that provokes a surge in Latino participation, Fernandez said, may turn on how the nonpartisan groups and Democratic organizations working on turnout respond.

""If the focus of the parties and those organizations is on the predictable electorate, that would be a mistake,"" he said during a recent conference call with reporters to release the Latino Decisions survey. ""There are many more people who are at play who could be potential voters. It's not just a question of what will those folks do on their own, but where will investments be made to encourage people to get out to vote?"""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160127141432-getty-latin-vote-registration-spanish-sign-super-tease.jpg

Abingdon, Virginia (CNN) A tale of two Virginia districts explains why the geographic, demographic and cultural chasm between the parties in the House of Representatives is about to grow much wider -- with ominous implications for America's escalating political tensions.

In the affluent, diverse, 10th Congressional District of Virginia in the Washington suburbs, a sharp backlash against President Trump has left Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock as perhaps the nation's most endangered GOP incumbent. Simultaneously, in the preponderantly white, working-class and rural 9th Congressional District of Virginia, which includes this picturesque town in the state's far southwestern corner, Trump's popularity is reinforcing the strength of Republican Rep. Morgan Griffith, who captured the seat from a veteran Democrat during the GOP landslide of 2010.

The contrasting prospects for Comstock and Griffith crystallize how the 2018 election could complete the geographic restructuring of the House that first fully snapped into view during that GOP sweep eight years ago.

We have had two countries for a while, but it is as if, appropriately enough under Trump, the walls are being raised. They are higher than ever.

In 2010, amid a sharp backlash against President Barack Obama, the GOP ousted dozens of House Democrats from small-town and rural districts; the casualties included many who had held their seats for decades, like Rick Boucher, the longtime Democratic representative from the 9th District who Griffith beat. Now the GOP faces the inverse risk: Democrats in November could sweep out 20 or more House Republicans like Comstock from districts centered on white-collar suburbs around the nation's biggest cities where Trump is unpopular.

""This could be very easily be a mirror image election (to 2010) from the Democratic side,"" says Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a leading House Republican strategist.

The biggest question for November, of course, is whether Democrats will gain the 24 seats they need to recapture the House majority. But whether or not they do, November could produce a realigning election that remakes the composition of the parties' coalitions in the House. Just as 2010 triggered an extended period of Republican advantage in small-town and rural districts, 2018 could do the same for Democrats in white-collar seats inside the largest metropolitan areas.

The trench separating red and blue America

In suburbs and rural areas, a lot of congressional districts used to split their votes between congressional and presidential elections. That's not happening nearly as much. A wave in 2010 swept a lot of Democrats out of rural areas. The same could happen in 2018 with Republicans in suburbs.

The result would be a geographic separation in the House as stark as any in modern times. Democrats seem likely to emerge from this fall's election with a clear upper hand in highly urbanized House seats that are racially and religiously diverse, disproportionately white-collar and secular and connected to the globalized information economy. Republicans, in turn, could remain dominant in districts outside of urban centers that are preponderantly white, heavily blue-collar, more religiously traditional and reliant on manufacturing, agriculture and resource extraction. The ideological, demographic, economic and even physical distance between the coalitions -- the trench separating red and blue America -- could be even greater than it is today.

""You look at the map -- and any (place) that has a disproportionately rural electorate -- and you can count it as Republican in any election, and the opposite is true in those suburban/urban"" areas, says Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist. ""We have had two countries for a while, but it is as if, appropriately enough under Trump, the walls are being raised. They are higher than ever. And I'm afraid that is going to be even more true in 2020 than in 2018.""

As opposed to a wave, this looks like a realignment and that's scarier. Former Republican Rep. Tom Davis

This accelerating separation leaves both parties in a precarious position. Many Republicans worry that under Trump they are losing support in the places that are adding population and jobs and increasingly relying on the places that are shrinking or stagnating on both fronts.

""As opposed to a wave, this (election) looks like a realignment and that's scarier,"" says Tom Davis, a former Republican representative from Northern Virginia, who chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee during his years in the House. ""That is a bigger problem for Republicans long term, because we are winning the places that are not the growing tide (in population), they are the shrinking tide, and that's not where you want to be.""

Some Democrats, in turn, fear that even greater dominance of the largest metropolitan areas will still leave them operating with too narrow a geographic base of support to consistently control majorities not only in the House, but also in the Senate and the Electoral College. In 2016, after all, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by obliterating Trump in the largest places -- she won 87 of the 100 largest counties by more than 15 million votes combined -- yet Trump carried the Electoral College by routing her outside of the big urban areas in enough of the battleground states, from North Carolina and Florida to Michigan and Wisconsin.

""If you can combine a ... respectable showing in some of these other areas of the country with obviously growing strength in urban and inner suburban areas and white-collar constituencies, then you have a winning formula,"" says long-term Democratic strategist Ruy Teixeira. ""The strength in these (metropolitan) areas can be canceled out by the structural problems in these other (small-town) areas.""

The divergent dynamics separating suburban and small-town America are neatly encapsulated in Virginia's 9th and 10th congressional districts. Though each is now represented by a Republican, the two places could hardly be more different. Whites represent almost 90% of the population in the 9th District, but only about 61% in the 10th. Immigrants (largely Hispanic and Asian) represent over 20% of the population in the 10th but less than 3% in the 9th. Just over half of the adults in the 10th District hold at least a four-year college degree, compared with only about 1-in-5 in the 9th. The median income in the 10th, at $120,384, is nearly triple its level in the 9th, less than $42,000.

Class inversion

The fact that Democratic prospects are rising in the district that is more affluent, better-educated and more racially diverse and are sagging in the district that is the opposite on each count testifies to the larger shifts that have remade the two parties' electoral coalitions over the past several decades. Particularly since the 1980s, the parties have experienced what I've called a ""class inversion,"" with Republicans growing stronger among the blue-collar whites who anchored the Democratic coalition for decades after World War II and Democrats adding growing competitiveness among white-collar whites (especially women) to their traditional advantages among nonwhite voters.

Typically, such changes in electoral behavior have been felt at the presidential level long before they filter down to congressional races. Republicans, for instance, started consistently winning Southern states at the presidential level in 1972 but didn't capture a majority of the region's congressional seats until 1994. Similarly, while Republicans built a solid advantage in small-town and rural areas at the presidential level starting in 2000, they did not immediately beat many of the House Democrats representing those areas.

These divisions don't start in Washington DC and come down; they are in the country and working up. Republican Rep. Tom Cole

Instead, the watershed election came in 2010 for rural and small-town Democratic House members such as Rick Boucher, who had held his Southwest Virginia seat for nearly 30 years. Boucher had deep roots in the district: He was born in Abingdon, and his grandfather had represented the area in the Virginia House of Delegates. He still remembers the town when it followed more bucolic rhythms.

""It was a place where farmers came to market and brought their goods,"" Boucher told me recently in an interview in the backyard of his home on Abingdon's peaceful main street. ""The downtown on Saturdays was packed. People were walking from one end of town to the other.""

Boucher represented the area in the Virginia state Senate for eight years, and then in 1982 he beat a longtime Republican incumbent to win the area's congressional seat. Boucher had a close squeeze in 1984, when he narrowly survived the Ronald Reagan landslide to win a second term. After that, he won re-election to Virginia's 9th Congressional District 12 more times, never capturing less than 59% of the vote, even as his culturally conservative, coal-producing and rural district steadily tilted its votes toward Republican presidential candidates. Republican presidential nominees George W. Bush in 2004 and John McCain in 2008 each carried nearly three-fifths of the district.

Swept out in a wave

Former Democratic Rep. Rick Boucher lost his rural Virginia seat in 2010.

Boucher survived by avoiding cultural conflicts wherever possible (he opposed President Bill Clinton's key gun-control initiatives, for instance) and concentrating on bread-and-butter economic concerns.

""What I was doing through all of those years was attracting federal funds to build industrial parks, water systems, wastewater systems. I developed my own program for attracting industry,"" he recalls.

But in 2010, Boucher's string ran out. Obama's first two years had stirred a huge conservative backlash in the district, with both the Affordable Care Act and the legislation passed by House Democrats to limit the carbon emissions linked to global climate change emerging as powerful flashpoints. Republican nominee Griffith, a former GOP majority leader in the state House, particularly emphasized Boucher's support for the ""cap and trade"" bill restricting carbon emissions, which was anathema in the area's coal-producing communities.

I'm tickled to death he's our President. Mark Matney on Donald Trump

For Mark Matney, a teacher in Abingdon who usually votes Republican but had sometimes supported Boucher, that was the breaking point.

""When people wanted something done and they went to Rick, he seemed to get it done. I mean, I've seen many families he helped,"" Matney told me. ""Then when Obama come in, Rick helped author cap and trade. It was at that moment when it got bad. When he done that with cap and trade, it was like he wasn't representing his people anymore.""

Boosted by heavy spending from outside conservative groups who linked Boucher to Obama and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi in a barrage of television advertising, Griffith, a Republican state House member, blew past the Democrat in 2010 by nearly 10,000 votes.

Boucher was hardly alone: The 2010 election virtually annihilated the center-right so-called ""blue dog"" Democratic House members, who mostly represented preponderantly white, heavily blue-collar, small-town and rural districts. Among those swept away that fall were Jim Oberstar in Minnesota (first elected in 1974), Gene Taylor from Mississippi (1989, in a special election), Ike Skelton of Missouri (1976), Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota (1992), Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania (1984), John Spratt of South Carolina (1982) and Chet Edwards of Texas (1990), as well as a long list of small-town Democrats who had won more recently.

Blake Andis used to be chairman of the Washington County Democratic Party. Now he's an official with the Washington County Republicans. See him in the video above.

Being traditional raised up here I always started out a meeting with the Pledge of Allegiance and a prayer and a couple of times I was asked not to pray. So, I thought, well, something's not right. Blake Andis

Jon Vogel, now a Democratic consultant, was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the GOP's 2010 sweep. He says it wasn't complacency that doomed the blue dog rural Democrats, it was that many voters who had long split their tickets between local Democrats and presidential Republicans were no longer willing to do so with Obama in the White House.

""I don't think anyone was caught napping,"" Vogel says. ""All of those guys got ready and ran their campaigns, but you couldn't survive what was coming. You couldn't overcome the DNA of the district, no matter how good a campaign you ran.""

Republicans have since solidified their hold over Boucher's old district. Griffith has carried at least three-fifths of the vote in each of his three re-elections. While Boucher and other Democrats view their 2018 nominee, farmer Anthony Flaccavento, as an energetic candidate, Griffith remains a strong favorite in part because of Trump's solid popularity here. Trump carried 68% of the vote in the 9th District in 2016 (the most in any Virginia US House district) and Matney says none of the personal and political controversies swirling around the President have dented his standing with conservatives here.

""To be 100% honest with you, no,"" he says. ""They think that he's up there to do what we want him to do: protect our guns, protect our rights, less government, more jobs. That's all they see, and I'm tickled to death he's our President.""

Trump's strong approval ratings among the white non-college and Christian voters who constitute a larger share of small-town and rural districts represent a huge headwind for Democrats in such places this fall. The party is targeting several Republicans in seats that fit that description, such as the northeast Iowa seat held by Rod Blum, the northern Maine seat held by Bruce Poliquin, John Faso's upstate New York seat and Rodney Davis' district in downstate Illinois.

Democratic tailwinds in the suburbs

Amanda Kelly had never been involved in politics. Frustration after 2016 has her working to defeat her Republican congresswoman.

I thought, 'No way, he's not going to win,' but when he did, I decided I had to start doing something because Congress is the only check. Amanda Kelly

But, by far, the Democrats' best opportunities are clustered in urban and suburban areas. In those places, Trump faces much lower approval ratings than usual for a Republican president among college-educated white voters, especially women. In the latest Quinnipiac University national poll, Trump's net disapproval rating among college-educated whites (19 points negative) was almost exactly as bad as Obama's among blue-collar whites in Pew Research Center polling (20 points negative) just before Republicans routed the small-town House Democrats in 2010.

With that tailwind, Democrats are pursuing Republican-held suburban seats in every region. In the East, they have multiple opportunities around New York City, Philadelphia, Miami and New Jersey; in Virginia, they have a strong shot not only at Comstock but also at Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who holds a seat centered on the Richmond suburbs that swung toward Democrats in last fall's gubernatorial and state House elections. In the Midwest, Democrats are targeting suburban Republican-held seats around Chicago; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Des Moines, Iowa; and more distantly Omaha, Nebraska. In the far West, Democrats have good chances in suburban Republican-held seats around Los Angeles and nearby Orange County; Tucson, Arizona; Denver; San Antonio; and Seattle. Democrats are also seriously contesting seats in Sunbelt metro areas that have previously been considered safe for Republicans, including districts around Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas; and Houston.

Mirror image of 2010

The Republican losses in white-collar House seats this year almost certainly won't match the Democratic retreat in blue-collar seats in 2010 because the GOP doesn't have quite as many members in seats that have moved away from the party at the presidential level. But the general dynamic, and direction, of change could prove very similar: The suburban Republicans in 2018, like the small-town Democrats in 2010, are standing on floorboards of support that have been rotting for years -- and may not be able to survive the added weight of hardening discontent with a President from their party.

Comstock's embattled situation in Virginia's 10th District captures that problem. First elected in 2014, Comstock won re-election in 2016 with 53% of the vote, although Clinton carried 52% there. With Trump in office, though, the district broke decisively last November for Democrat Ralph Northam over Republican Ed Gillespie in the governor's race and swept out several Republicans holding seats in the state House that overlapped with Comstock's seat.

The first general election public poll in the district, by Monmouth University, showed the Democratic nominee, state Sen. Jennifer Wexton, leading Comstock by an imposing 10 percentage points. A 53% majority of the district's voters said they disapproved of Trump's performance, and more than four-fifths of them said they intended to vote against Comstock.

""I think everybody is looking at her race and saying, 'How in the world does she win?' "" says Sabato, the University of Virginia political scientist.

Like many suburban Republicans, Comstock is running in a diversifying district (Hispanics, Asians and minorities who classify themselves as ""other"" combine for about 32% of the population). Democrats are hoping for the same kind of strong turnout among them that helped Kathy Tran, a refugee from South Vietnam, win a House of Delegates seat last fall in a district that overlaps with Comstock's.

""I think that the energy that we really helped to start in 2017 is ... going (to) be a huge tsunami in November,"" said Tran, who became one of the first two Asian-American women in the state House. ""My experience in Virginia has been that we have turned the corner and the vast majority of people want a welcoming and inclusive commonwealth.""

Rep. Barbara Comstock speaks during a hearing on Capitol Hill.

Comstock, like the other suburban Republicans, also risks being caught in the backlash against Trump among many college-educated white voters, especially women. (In the Monmouth poll, 60% of the district's whites with a college degree disapproved of Trump's performance.) And she is confronting a surge of energy among liberal-leaning voters, even many of those who had not previously been politically active.

Amanda Kelly, a retail store manager from Bluemont, is one of those. She didn't vote until she was 30 (for Obama in 2008) and before the 2016 election couldn't name her governor or US representative. All that changed after Trump's victory.

""At the rallies I saw violence, I saw racism, assault, terrible things (and) I thought, 'No way, he's not going to win,' "" she says. ""But when he did, I decided I had to start doing something, because Congress is the only check.""

Now Kelly has become a tireless activist in Indivisible, the grass-roots Democratic group committed to opposing Trump, as well as other local political organizations; in the 24 hours before I spoke with her last month, she had participated in two separate demonstrations (one that required her to arrive at 4 a.m. to start setting up) over Trump's family separation practice.

""People feel really passionate,"" she says. ""You know, fortunately Trump provides a lot of fodder for that.""

Over 300 miles away in the state's far southwest corner, Matney is just as passionate in his embrace of Trump and his determination to maintain the Republican congressional majority that supports and defends the President. If anything, Matney says, as a socially conservative Republican he feels more connected to Trump in office than he did as a candidate.

These clashing perspectives demonstrate why the midterm election is less likely to produce a wave that rolls equally across the country than a split-level current that carries metropolitan America closer to the Democrats without seriously breaching the Republican fortress beyond it. That could leave the Congress, and the country, glaring across demographic and geographic divides etched as sharply as during the most polarized times in American history.

""It means legislative gridlock,"" says Cole, the Republican representative from Oklahoma. ""I always tell people I don't have a Democratic member of Congress who lives within 200 miles of me in any direction. These divisions don't start in Washington, DC, and come down; they are in the country and working up. ... We have been seeing this coming for a while. But we really are in an age of regionalization of politics that is reminiscent of the 1850s."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180719163245-20180719-two-americas-flag-illustration-super-tease.jpg
f8e814088c5545d3ab6609de2fad8d7f	['Analysis Ronald Brownstein']	2018-05-22 00:00:00	Beating Republicans in November will be harder than Democrats thought	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Beating Republicans in November will be harder than Democrats thought	1	"(CNN) It's become a numbing Washington ritual. Donald Trump shatters a traditional boundary on the exercise of presidential power. Or he uses inflammatory language that stirs racial animosities. Or he's hit by new revelations in the overlapping investigations into his campaign's contacts with foreign governments in 2016 and his own tangled financial and personal affairs before the presidency.

As each of these bombshells detonate, sometimes within hours of each other, congressional Republican leaders then react with little more than a shrug. Even more important, the vast majority of the Republican electoral coalition increasingly responds the same way.

All of these dynamics played out multiple times this past week. Trump shattered boundaries by openly demanding the Department of Justice investigate the ongoing special counsel examination of his campaign and by privately pressuring the US Postal Service to raise rates on Amazon , whose owner, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post, which Trump considers an enemy. He used George Wallace-like language in describing members of the MS-13 gang as ""animals."" And he faced the startling revelation that during the 2016 campaign his son Donald Trump Jr., who had earlier convened with Russians offering damaging information on Hillary Clinton, also met with emissaries of Middle Eastern governments offering to help in the election.

After all that, Republicans responded this week with the sort of silence usually expected from the crowd at the 18th hole of a golf tournament.

The Trump paradox

The elimination of any distance between Trump and the conventional Republican interests that controlled the party before him has happened so incrementally it can be difficult to discern from day to day. But it remains one of the central political dynamics of 2018. Over the long term, Trump's success at stamping his polarizing brand on the GOP remains a huge electoral gamble for the party because it risks alienating the young, well-educated and diverse groups growing, rather than shrinking, in the electorate.

But in the near-term, the GOP's choice to ally so unequivocally with such a unique president may have the paradoxical effect of producing a much more conventional midterm election than seemed possible earlier this year. And that means for Democrats to secure the gains they seek in November, they will need to overcome the typical challenges they face in a midterm election far more than they expected even only a few months ago.

In both 2010 and 2014, the two midterm elections under Barack Obama, Democrats suffered huge losses. Each time the party faced similar problems. The biggest was a collapse in turnout among young voters, and a smaller, but still significant, decline among minorities. In both 2010 and 2014, the share of the vote cast by young adults 18-29, a strongly Democratic-leaning group, was fully six percentage points lower than in the presidential race just two years earlier, according to exit polls.

Each time, the non-white share of the vote dropped three points compared to the previous presidential contest. In turn, seniors, who now lean strongly toward the GOP, represented a significantly greater share of the vote in each midterm than in the previous presidential race.

Those turnout problems for Democrats were compounded by anemic performances among white men and women without a college degree, and white men with degrees. In both 2010 and 2014, according to exit polls, Democratic congressional candidates carried no more than 36% of voters in each of those groups. The party's performance among college-educated white women was better (43% in 2010 and 47% in 2014) but still below their strongest showings with those women in recent years.

Through much of 2017, it appeared possible that Trump's general weakness might solve all of these traditional Democratic problems -- or at least render them inconsequential.

Especially during the extended Republican struggle to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Trump's presidency sometimes seemed at risk of functional collapse under the combined pressure of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russian election meddling investigation, internal administrative chaos and incompetence, chronic divisions between the White House and congressional Republicans and the president's inability or unwillingness to control a belligerent and volatile temperament.

It's still possible any of those factors -- or some combination of them -- could politically debilitate Trump or, much less likely, even force him for office. But it no longer seems plausible that he will simply implode.

Rather over the past several months -- particularly since the passage of the GOP tax plan late last year -- Trump has shown clear signs of consolidating more of the usual Republican institutional and electoral base than he had earlier, despite all the norm-breaking excesses of his presidency. His approval rating in most polls has moved up from the high thirties to the low forties. That's still weaker than it should be given the robust economy, but a clear sign that he has recaptured many traditionally center-right voters. Over that same period, the tightening generic ballot test measuring preferences for the 2018 election show much of that same support drifting back, like metal filings toward a magnet, around congressional Republicans.

That doesn't mean Democrats can't retake the House or conceivably even the Senate in 2018 or beat Trump in 2020. But it does mean they can't rely on Republican disarray to power those victories. Despite all of Trump's unique liabilities, the key institutions and voter blocks of red America show every sign of mobilizing to maintain their control of power in Washington.

Support for Trump in key groups

Since he took office, Trump's approval rating has always been high among self-identified Republicans and core Republican groups. The most recent national polls from CNN and the Pew Research Center , for instance, both put his approval rating among white men without a college degree at a robust 66%. More than three-fifths of those men also said they intend to support Republican candidates for Congress this fall.

Even more telling may be the preferences the polls recorded among two groups of generally Republican-leaning white voters who Democrats have hoped would abandon the GOP under Trump: white men with a college degree, and white women without one. The two polls vary slightly in their measurement of how those voters view Trump himself: in the CNN poll, both groups give him an approval rating around 50%, while in the Pew Survey, he draws about 45% approval from both.

Yet both surveys show that Republicans now hold a solid lead with both groups in their preferences for the midterm election. Both surveys show Republicans now drawing over 50% of college-educated white men, while among blue-collar women Pew puts the GOP slightly above 50% and CNN shows them just slightly below. In each survey, Democrats are winning only about two-fifths of both groups. Those advantages aren't as lopsided as Republicans enjoyed in 2010 or 2014, but if they endure, they may be sufficient to blunt the Democrats' gains in 2018.

A shift to Democrats by college-educated women

The clearest improvement for Democrats from 2010 and 2014 is that both polls show Trump facing disapproval from about two-thirds of college-educated white women. Almost exactly three-fifths of those women in each survey say they plan to vote Democratic in November. That's significantly more than Democrats have won among that group in any congressional election since 1992, according to exit polls, and that shift alone could allow them to capture several seats Republicans hold in white-collar suburbs. The 2017 elections also have demonstrated a high level of engagement among African-American voters, especially women-and they register passionate distaste for Trump in polls.

But if those are the only ways the electorate in 2018 differs from 2010 and 2014, Democrats would likely be disappointed in the results. The party is betting on greater engagement from its core voters than among Republicans, but a succession of Trump policy decisions aimed at energizing the GOP base (such as hardline approaches to immigration) may be narrowing that gap: the CNN survey showed only a modest six percentage point gap between the share of Republican and Democratic-leaning voters who said they were very enthusiastic about voting.

And while recent reports show voter registration rising among younger voters in some key states, the proportion of younger adults who say they are closely following news about the election was far lower than for any other age group in the Pew poll. That's despite the deep opposition to Trump that they register in all surveys.

The headwinds facing Republicans in November remain formidable: the last three times one party went into a midterm election with unified control of government (the Democrats in 1994 and 2010 and the Republicans in 2006) voters revoked it. Trump's approval rating after his recent gains is higher than George W. Bush's was at the time of the 2006 Republican loss, but still lower than Obama or Bill Clinton during their midterm defeats. And while polls show mixed evidence of a Democratic turnout advantage in November, in practice, party voters have stampeded to the polls in the actual elections held since Trump took office. Fundraising for Democrats is astronomical as well.

But compared to six months ago, the constant gales swirling around Trump no longer look as certain to blow away all of the GOP's traditional midterm advantages. Nor does it appear likely that any new revelation in the various investigations of Trump will dissolve support for him or the GOP Congress. As in earlier midterm elections, mobilizing young people still looks like a challenge for Democrats, as does persuading more blue-collar white women and white-collar white men.

In other words, even with all of the turmoil around Trump, there is no cavalry coming to rescue blue America from Republican dominance of Washington. Democrats will need to storm those gates themselves, beginning with finding ways to overcome the resurfacing obstacles that have hurt them so badly in midterm elections before."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180515151509-donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-05-15-2018-super-tease.jpg

Samantha Tse is an experienced fashion writer and editor. Her work has been published in several international publications including T Magazine, Women's Wear Daily, CNN Style, Allure and Disegno.

It was announced yesterday that American fashion brand Michael Kors had snapped up famed label Versace for $2.1 billion , taking over one of the last independent Italian brands in an effort to build an empire to rival major European conglomerates LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton (whose stable of brands includes Givenchy, Fendi, Dior among many others) and Kering (Gucci, Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga and others).

With Versace and Jimmy Choo (purchased in 2017) under his belt, Kors, who will rename his company Capri Holdings Limited upon completion of the sale, is already wreaking havoc in the existing power structure that has dominated luxury fashion since the 1990s. The question now is whether the American designer and his chief executive and chairman John Idol can succeed where their other countrymen have failed and create America's first luxury group.

""Whereas the Kors women has a healthy athletic glow and good manners, the Versace muse is a bronzed goddess, swigging champagne until the early hours.""

""Michael Kors is building what is virtually unknown: an American backed luxury parent company. Provided it works, it places him in a league apart from his rivals such as Ralph Lauren,"" fashion historian Bronwyn Cosgrave said in a phone interview. ""He will not only be the figurehead behind his own name brand but could become known for revitalizing a legendary European brand, which no American designer has accomplished.""

What does the acquisition mean for both brands and what will they gain by joining up?

Michael Kors and Versace are two brands who are known for their seduction and glamor, albeit at different ends of the spectrum, but the venture could be highly advantageous to both parties.

Long Island-born Michael Kors launched his brand in 1981 and has built his empire selling aesthetics drawn from the American jet-set lifestyle. His woman is sun-kissed with a neutral lip and a healthy glow. Her hair is always glossed, and she's adorned in gold accessories.

Kors has made most of his money in the mid-market, with a large presence in shopping malls. The brand has a strong focus on accessories ranging from bags to shoes and watches, which are coveted both in America and in Europe. And, the American designer is a household name through his fashion label but also because of his 10-year stint as a judge on Project Runway.

Versace, on the other hand, is the epitome of Italian fashion: high-octane glamour and sex appeal at a very high price point. Whereas the Kors women has a healthy athletic glow and good manners, the Versace muse is a bronzed goddess, swigging champagne until the early hours.

Versace is also a household name, but more so for its association with celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, who wore the now infamous green silk dress with a neckline that dipped to her naval, and Elizabeth Hurley, whose Versace safety pin dress catapulted her into stardom.

Versace was founded by Gianni Versace in 1978. Until his murder in 1997, he ran the creative side of the business and was credited with creating the supermodel phenomenon of the 1980s and 90s, championing diversity and blending high fashion with pop culture. After his death, his sister Donatella took over the brand. (She will remain as its creative director after the sale.)

What's the drama?

It's no surprise that a sale of this magnitude has raised some eyebrows. Some of the controversy stems from Versace, a brand historically aligned with Italian heritage, culture and craftsmanship, being purchased by an American company that has made its money in malls. But Versace has also suffered because of its lack of accessibility. For many luxury houses, makeup or accessories are the entry point, areas where Versace lags. While it produces handbags and shoes, none of it is particularly coveted or seen as a must-have product.

Michael Kors' chief executive and chairman John Idol wants to remedy this. His strategy for Versace, as outlined in a statement by the brand, includes an increase in accessories and footwear, and the opening of approximately 100 new stores around the world. Idol aims to grow Versace's revenue to $2 billion in the long term.

""(Kors) also has immense credibility in this space. While Michael Kors handbags today are as sought after as Prada in Europe, Mr. Kors was also instrumental in revitalizing Celine. His seven-year tenure there transformed it from virtually dormant to relevant,"" said Cosgrave. ""With his own brand, he seems to have made it a success by distilling European fashion trends to the American market. He has a solid track record creating ready-to-wear and perhaps this can lend credibility to Versace,"" Cosgrave said.

Michael Kors isn't the first American to try to create a homegrown version of the conglomerates that dominate European luxury. Several have tried, including Liz Claiborne who purchased American mid-market brands Juicy Couture, Lucky Brand jeans and Kate Spade in 2012. Most recently Tapestry who owns Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, is trying to enter the arena but Kors is planning a group of a different kind: one whose focus is global rather than harvesting only American brands.

With Jimmy Choo and Versace under his belt, he's got his gloves on and is ready to enter the ring. Kors may be the underdog now but as the American fashion company is slowly wedging its way into an arena heavily dominated by European conglomerates. And by amalgamating luxury European brands into the American fold, he is both giving American luxury a one-up on the global stage, and dissolving fashion borders that have been tied to class and national heritage, and creating a more global approach within the industry."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180924135906-17-style-versace-super-tease.jpg

Eighteen-year-old Adut Akech has a number of dreams. One: Earn a business degree and open and open schools in her native South Sudan. Two: Become a journalist and inspire other women to lead. Three: Build her own empire by the age of 30, so she never has to work for anyone else ever again.

It could happen. Her current career -- as one of the world's most sought-after young models -- must have seemed just as ambitious a goal.

It was only two years ago, mere months after graduating from high school in Adelaide, Australia, that she made her runway debut, walking as an exclusive in the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2017 show.

Since then, she's walked for the likes of Christian Dior, Burberry, Alexander McQueen and Prada, and this past July became only the second black model to close the Chanel haute couture show.

""Even if I become the richest model in the world I will still be a refugee. I am a refugee."" Adut Akech

Then, of course, there are the covers for Italian, Korean and British editions of Vogue; the editorials with Tim Walker, Mario Sorrenti, Juergen Teller and Inez and Vinoodh; and the major advertising campaigns for Saint Laurent, Valentino, Versace and Moschino.

""No one looks like Adut,"" wrote Edward Enninful , editor of British Vogue, in an email. After seeing her walk for Saint Laurent, he enlisted Akech for the 2018 Pirelli calendar shot by Tim Walker; and, more recently, put her on his May 2018 cover.

""Not only is she extraordinarily beautiful, she also has a sweetness that comes through in her pictures. If Naomi Campbell and Alek Wek had a love child, it would be Adut.""

Earlier this month, during New York Fashion Week, Akech was taken by surprise when she'd made the Business of Fashion's (BoF) annual 500 list honoring the professionals shaping the fashion industry.

""I was freaking out when I found out about it, I never thought I'd be chosen,"" she said. ""I always look at BoF. Imran said to me, 'I've been following your work for the last two years and it's incredible, you're so inspiring.' So there are people out there seeing what I do. It's amazing.""

Why does she think everyone's paying attention to her? ""Maybe it's my personality, how I carry myself. I'm very friendly, easy to get along with,"" she said. ""I feed off energy and vibes.""

Born in a refugee camp in South Sudan amid ongoing conflict with the north, Akech grew up in Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp , before moving to Adelaide with her mother and five siblings.

""Even if I become the richest model in the world I will still be a refugee. I am a refugee,"" she said. She still remembers those early years in Kenya, and her mother's struggles to support her family. ""When I first moved to Australia at age six, I promised my mother I would finish school, buy her a car and make something out of myself.""

The path to fame has been far from easy. From a young age she was bullied for the way she looked -- her dark skin, her lithe physique, and particularly her full lips and her trademark tooth gap. One early cover shoot for an Australian magazine was tainted by an employee's complaints that her look wouldn't appeal to their audience.

Today, as debates around fashion and beauty's longstanding lack of diversity and inclusivity trigger historic waves of change, this kind of experience is a sobering reminder of how much the industry still has to evolve. But Akech, part of a new cohort of models defying Eurocentric standards, is optimistic that attitudes are changing.

Now, more and more designers and magazines are casting women of varying skin tones and body types, while those who don't face widespread criticism on social media.

""It's going to take a while to see this change take over,"" she said. ""But it makes me very proud to be a model at this moment where I can be part of that change.""

Akech hopes her own success can inspire others, showing young girls that ""black is beautiful,"" much in the same way that Naomi Campbell (""She's like my mom here""), Alek Wek and Lupita Nyong'o did for her.

""I want to tell the girls who look like me and girls who have insecurities that, instead of hating (their appearance) and trying to cover it up, they should just embrace it and be proud of it,"" she said.

397609eabaca4b5785caf003f65df184	[]	2018-07-31 02:23:48+00:00	Simon Stålenhag's hauntingly beautiful retro sci-fi art	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Simon Stålenhag's hauntingly beautiful retro sci-fi art	1	"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

Simon Stålenhag's paintings are a strange, irresistible mix of mundane scenes from the Swedish countryside and haunting scenarios involving abandoned robots, mysterious machinery and even dinosaurs.

They are the product of his childhood memories -- growing up in suburban Stockholm and painting landscapes and wildlife -- and his adulthood appreciation for sci-fi.

""I try to make art for my 12-year-old self,"" he said in a phone interview. ""I want to make stuff that would make my younger self see it and go, 'I'm not supposed to look at this because it's for adults, but I really want to anyway.'""

'Tales from the Loop'

Stålenhag has gained a cult following for his hyper-realistic art, which he first began publishing online through Facebook and Twitter. In 2014 he published his first book, in which the artwork is complemented by a novel-length written story. ""The art took on a life of its own, because at first I didn't publish the words, but they were always there. I just waited until I had enough to publish a book,"" he said.

The rights to the book, titled ""Tales from the Loop,"" have been acquired by Amazon Studios, which will develop an 8-episode live action series based on it. The pilot will be directed by Mark Romanek, whose previous credits include 2002's ""One hour photo"" with Robin Williams, which happens to be one of Stålenhag's favorite films.

The story is set in an alternate, retro-futuristic Swedish countryside in the early 1990s, and involves children growing up around robots and a massive underground scientific facility that is spawning weird phenomena.

The plot draws parallels to ""Stranger Things,"" although ""Tales from the Loop"" predates the popular Netlfix series. Both shows were inspired by classics like ""E.T."" and ""The Goonies.""

""I wrote it as almost a memoir, where I go back and describe how it felt to grow up in this small Swedish town, which is actually a real place. There's a general theme of technology being more advanced in this universe, but there's no big supervillain or anything like that,"" said Stålenhag.

""The biggest threats in this world are like those we all face in life, like being bullied at school or your parents going through a divorce. I wanted to make a very mundane, realistic science fiction story.""

Pacifica

Stålenhag published two more narrative artbooks, ""Things from the Flood"" in 2016 (a sequel to ""Tales from the Loop"") and ""The Electric State"" in 2017. The latter isn't set in Sweden but in a fictional US megastate called Pacifica, which corresponds roughly to California, Oregon and Washington. It was inspired by a trip to the West Coast and the photos he took there.

""I always start by going out and taking photos, trying to find cool locations that I take tons of reference photos of. Then I play around with these images and paint on top of them in Photoshop and just try things out,"" he explained.

""When I've found something I like, I start over and do these huge paintings which are basically traditional media, because I do everything with brushstrokes and don't use any photo textures.""

In ""The Electric State,"" a girl and her yellow robot travel through an alternate reality in 1997, with ruins of giant battle drones scattered across the American landscape. The movie rights were acquired last year by the Russo brothers, the directors of ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" with the writers from that film, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, set to work on the screenplay. The director of ""It,"" Anthony Muschietti, is in negotiations to direct.

Online feedback

Among his influences, Stålenhag cites Ralph McQuarrie, whose concept art became a visual bible for ""Star Wars,"" and Syd Mead, whose production design brought ""Blade Runner,"" ""Aliens"" and ""Tron"" to life. As a child, Stålenhag tried to imitate the work of Swedish watercolor painter Gunnar Brusewitz and wildlife artist Lars Jonsson.

""My style could be described as a mix between those Swedish painters and the great concept artists of the 1970s,"" he said.

He's currently working on his fourth book, which he reveals will be a very bleak story about a kid and his parents traveling through a post-apocalyptic landscape where everything's just ash.

""Almost all the art for this project comes from photos that I took during a snowstorm in Stockholm in February. I got all this spooky pictures and they look very foggy because of the snow. When I started playing around with them I ended up getting some really weird pale green and yellow colors which inspired the setting of the new book.""

As with the previous collections, Stålenhag has already published artwork from this new book online, looking for feedback and inspiration for the story.

""I start with the art. And I have a kind of vague idea of what kind of characters I have in this environment. But then I start actually rendering the images and putting them out there on Twitter and watch (how) other people react to them. And sometimes my idea of the story changes along with that."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180724145025-stalenhag-fjarrhandske-super-tease.jpg

Photographer and artist Chen Man is CNN Style's guest editor. She has commissioned a series of features on visual language and imagining the future.

The definition of beauty changes all the time. And sometimes, as society develops, it goes in cycles, like the changing of the four seasons. Not so long ago, Chinese people saw fashion as something that came from the West. Afraid to make ""mistakes,"" they looked to Europe and America to see which standards had been set. As a result, fashion in China looked pale and blurry.

But now, the Internet, technology and social media have rendered the world flat. Fashion can be accessed from anywhere, with styles from around the world cohabiting and influencing one another. Go to a high-end Beijing department store, for instance, and you'll see shoppers holding Hermes bags and wearing Chanel tops with Uggs -- all while holding a string of Buddhist prayer beads in their hands. Fusion is the future of fashion.

Like her peers, Chen has witnessed enormous change in China, and has sought to document the profound effect those changes have had on her generation, known as balinghou, or those born after the 1980s. Credit: Chen Man

As a visual artist who grew up in this ""new"" China, I witnessed my generation's material dreams become a reality. I look to my background for inspiration. But I also believe that repetition is a disease -- and I don't want my work to reinforce stereotypes. Images of dragons and phoenixes are powerful, but when people use them again and again, they lose the power to be fresh or exciting. I want to capture the real contemporary China, not to please people with cliches.

""This relationship between technology and aesthetics is like that of science and philosophy -- in an ideal world, the two walk side by side,"" said Chen Man. Credit: dawei

The country my generation now inhabits is no longer isolated from outside information and ideas. I use technology in my photography, and I believe this is the future of visual art. If technology can help artists present things in new and better ways, why shouldn't we embrace it? There is no need for artists to live in the past. After all, we live in a world where artificial intelligence is so advanced that it can create art free from human input.

AI is a new species created by humankind. We give it language and the ability to do certain things -- just as we do our own children. But, like a child, when AI has matured enough, it will develop its own language and its own abilities.

We may bestow AI with creativity, but that doesn't mean it can't be creative in its own right. Artificial thinking and decision-making is rooted in the power and experience of countless human minds, so it's only logical that this will result in better, bigger and more advanced brains than our own.

It has already created wonderful examples of painting and music. Yet, some critics question whether anything created this way can ever be considered real art. This is because most people have a limited understanding of AI. They see it as unfathomably complex, or the stuff of science fiction. But applying AI to visual art need not be high-tech. Even the simplest of photo processing apps owe their existence to the development of AI, and its applications will only widen in the near future.

This relationship between technology and aesthetics is like that of science and philosophy -- in an ideal world, the two walk side by side. Achieving such a balance requires artists to master both, combining art and skill in the process.

Visual language is that which doesn't need translation. We are born unable to talk, but we can immediately see blue skies, red flowers and human emotion. What we see can make us feel pleased or worried, fearful or safe. For this reason, I believe that in a globalized world, the future should be -- and will be -- more visual.

""Visual language is that which doesn't need translation,"" said Chen Man. Credit: Chen Man

Having said that, I can't predict what the future of visual art will look like. None of us can. The world changes too fast, and the possibilities of the future will far exceed anything we attempt to envision today. But I can talk about my hopes.

I hope people become better at communicating with their hearts. I hope we focus more on content, not format. I hope that we can all learn from the traditional Chinese values that keep life and nature in harmony. We need to find balance in diversity, like a symphony."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180904102542-chen-man-portrait-1-super-tease.jpg

If London is the fashion capital known for its hot young things, and Paris is the city of couture and history-laden heavyweights, then Milan sits somewhere in the middle. Once synonymous only with the glamour of the big names -- Armani, Gucci, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana -- in recent seasons the city has become a hotbed for new labels pushing to the fore. The likes of MSGM, Marco de Vincenzo, No. 21 and GCDS are now all commanding the same attention and column inches once reserved for the power players. Presenting new perspectives on Italian fashion, these brands have saved the city from going stale.

But the fashion industry on the whole -- regardless of country -- is in a state of flux, facing tough questions on equality, diversity and relevance in 2018. With this in mind, it wasn't just the clothes that had people talking. Here are five of Milan's key takeaways.

Embracing diversity ... finally

It's no secret that fashion week needs to up its game when it comes to racial diversity, and, historically, Milan has lagged on this front. Last season, only 27% non-white models were cast.

But this season, there seemed to be a notable increase. Model Winnie Harlow opened both Byblos and Philipp Plein, while Fendi was opened by Adwoa Aboah and closed by Adut Akech. Philipp Plein, often one of the most divisive shows of the season, was one of the front-runners when it came to racial diversity: about half of his cast were models of color, including hijab-wearing model Halima Aden.

Age came into play too. Designer Erika Cavallini cast a group of older women to walk, a refreshing change that won't go unnoticed by her customers.

Feminism on the brain

During Milan Fashion Week, the New York Times released a damning exposé detailing the exploitation of female workers at the bottom of the manufacturing chain in southern Italy by luxury Italian brands, including Max Mara and Fendi. While the National Chamber of Italian Fashion sent out a press release trying to reframe its findings, the report kept the politics of fashion at the forefront of everyone's minds.

On the runway, gender politics were most astutely dissected by Miuccia Prada. The Prada collection was borne of the tightrope we walk between conservatism and liberalism, provocation and virtue. The prim elements -- knitted jumpers over white shirts, long skirts -- featured revealing cut-out details on the bust and back and were juxtaposed with transparent knee-high stockings and awkward sock-cum-sandals in jarring bright colors for off-kilter sex appeal.

Versace, too, was a celebration of womanhood, with Donatella Versace dedicating the show to powerful, fearless women everywhere. The collection of unashamed, modern glamour was made to accentuate and sculpt the female form fit the current moment perfectly. And the cherry on top? Nineties supermodel Shalom Harlow closing the show after a six-year runway hiatus, showing the Insta-generation just how it's done.

Doing it for the 'gram

In Milan, a city that lives for glitz and glamour, ""less is more"" does not apply. And when it came to this season's shows excess was definitely on trend, with social media playing perhaps the biggest part in some designers' decisions. Emporio Armani went for gold by taking over part of the city's Linate Airport, ushering some 2,500 guests through security and departure gates into a hangar -- which is already normally emblazoned with the brand's name and logo -- for pre-show cocktails and mini hot dogs. The show itself, held in a purpose-built stadium within the hangar, was the Instagram success the brand was no doubt vying for -- perhaps the most valuable currency of a fashion show now.

Elsewhere, Moschino's sense of humor provided plenty of Instagram fodder, with Jeremy Scott choosing to show an ""unfinished"" collection which had been scribbled over with colored markers. A shrug seemingly fashioned from an oversized tape measure and Gigi Hadid in a wedding dress surrounded by floating butterflies were particular hits.

And finally, it wouldn't be Milan Fashion Week without a spectacle from Philipp Plein, the self-proclaimed ""king of bling."" The designer may have taken stick in the past for his over-the-top collections, but it's undeniable that he understands the power of social media as a tool to elevate his brand's star power.

The collection, inspired by Michael Jackson, was wholly predictable, yet the addition of Chris Brown, Rita Ora, rapper 6ix9ine and a troop of burlesque performers made Plein's show a viral sensation.

""Social media changed the whole game for fashion,"" Plein said in an email after the show. ""More and more brands choose a similar formula to mine ... Now everyone invites celebrities and performers, but when I started I was the only one doing that in Milan.""

America the beautiful

The United Sates may be gripped by political turmoil, but designers are still finding inspiration in the country's sunnier days. Fledgling brand Brognano took its cues from the surfer community of the Californian coast for their first show, an influence shared by Etro, who went one step further and cast professional surfers as models.

Elsewhere Byblos looked to the Nevada desert and Burning Man, citing its vibrancy and radical nature as key influences for Spring-Summer 2019. MSGM found peace and love in tie-dye, while rising star Marco de Vincenzo called on the childhood memory of an aunt visiting his home in Sicily from the US, bringing little pieces of American culture with each visit. The collection was a hybrid, a tale of two contrasting countries, the urban and the rural, or as the designer stated, ""the drama and vitality of Sicily and the innocence and optimism of America.""

Sportswear grows up

For several years now, sportswear has been making itself heard on runways around the world, from the ugly trainer craze still sweeping the fashion industry to canny collaborations -- most recently between Fila and Fendi, who teamed teaming up for next-level amounts of logomania (seen front row on Nicki Minaj at this week's Fendi show.)

But Spring-Summer 2019 is throwing us up a new one: cycling shorts. A trend that has been bubbling on Instagram for a while now -- see Kylie Jenner's skin-tight ensembles -- Lycra has gone luxe. And in Milan they were everywhere: We saw navy ones on Bella Hadid at Fendi, fluorescent ones at Blumarine, printed ones at Prada, and baggy ones at Sportmax. Something for everyone, it seems."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180922205224-19-milan-fashion-week-ss19-super-tease.jpg

Few readers will recognize the woman on the cover of Business of Fashion's print edition this month. She's not a model, she's not a designer, she is not the leader of a luxury conglomerate. Kalpona Akter is a former child worker from Bangladesh.

Akter, now an activist fighting for what she calls ""jobs with dignity,"" began working in a garment factory aged 12 after her father (the family's sole earner) suffered a stroke. She remembers her first day vividly -- the sound of the machines and shouting voices were frightening. On a video call from Dhaka, she recounted having ""never seen so many people in one place before.""

Fast-forward a couple of years and her fear had evolved into activism. By the age of 14, she was campaigning on the factory floor. By 17, it was her bosses who were the fearful ones. They fired her for being a troublemaker and tried to get other factories to blacklist her. This move proved to be short-sighted -- on their part, at least -- as it only served to propel Akter into a far more powerful position. The 42-year-old is now the executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity

By her own estimate, she represents some four million people at the bottom of the fashion supply chain -- many of them whom labor in conditions that would shock those working in the industry in New York, London, Paris or Milan.

Minimum wage for garment factory workers in Bangladesh is currently around $68 per month. She is campaigning to get this up to $200 by the end of the year, while simultaneously battling issues around economic freedom for women, violence and mistreatment on the factory floor.

Fashion's new vanguard

Fashion's complex ecosystem

Akter is one of four people to appear on the front cover of Business of Fashion's (BoF) cover this month, which reveals the title's annual BoF 500 list . Now in its sixth year, the list has come to serve as the definitive guide to the people shaping fashion today.

Akter and her fellow cover stars provide a snapshot of where the industry is trying -- slowly, but perhaps more surely than in previous years -- to go. As a set, they attempt to offer a more accurate picture of the global fashion industry's complex ecosystem.

Completing the line-up are: Francois Henri-Pinault, CEO of Kering, a luxury group that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga; the young Yara Shahidi, an actress, model, activist and student in her first year at Harvard; and Virgil Abloh, the first ever black artistic director at Louis Vuitton.

In a note announcing this year's cover stars, BoF founder and editor-in-chief Imran Amed described 2018 as ""harrowing,"" referencing sexual misconduct (allegations against photographers Mario Testino, Bruce Weber and Patrick Demarchelier have all surfaced this year) and ongoing gender inequality issues, as well as the conditions and pay of workers in the industry.

Speaking from his office before the list was announced, Amed admitted that the selection process was troubling this year.

""In such a difficult year, what was there to celebrate?"" he said. ""In previous years, the BoF 500 has been a huge celebration for the fashion industry. But this year, in particular, we wanted to put our lens on the people who are attacking and addressing some of these issues head on.

""And so it's a celebration, but it's a celebration of the people who are emblematic of the change that we need to see in fashion.""

The other BoF cover stars have different, but perhaps no less pressing, concerns about the state of the industry. At the other end of the supply chain, Pinault sees an inability to look ahead as a major threat.

""The biggest risk for the luxury industry, as for many others, is short-term thinking,"" he said. ""It's good to run a flourishing business now, but what about tomorrow?

""As business leaders, we have a responsibility towards our shareholders, clients and other stakeholders -- as well as to the planet -- to consider long-term issues and to try to anticipate possible risks, even if they seem extremely hypothetical. For example, what if one day we could no longer use leather? Or cotton?""

BoF 500 veteran Alexa Chung (she was added to the list in 2013), a model who recently started her own label, has similar fears about the sustainability of fashion.

""The most pressing issue for me right now is the environmental impact of fashion on the planet,"" she wrote in an email. ""I believe we have reached a stage where companies can no longer blithely plough on doing what we do without educating ourselves about how our businesses could run in a less harmful way.

Alexa Chung Credit: Alexa Chung

""We need to advocate a circular economy by informing and engaging with our customer base and encouraging them to reconsider the consumption of a garment or accessory. We should search for solutions to collect items back, for materials to be re-used, for customers to find and use platforms to re-sell their used garments... the list goes on.""

But the problems facing the fashion industry are vast and complex. Action that furthers one cause -- such as reducing consumption -- may hinder another. When asked about the messages she wanted people to hear the loudest right now, Akter said: ""Keep buying clothes!""

After the Rana Plaza disaster five years ago -- where more than 1,000 workers lost their lives after a nine-story factory building collapsed suddenly in Dhaka -- it's easy to understand how consumers might feel conflicted. Should they stop buying clothes made in Bangladesh? No, said Akter. Her message is to buy responsibly, and to demand more from brands. In her opinion, the power of the consumers' collective voice must be deployed.

Visibility, voice and sustained positive change

There are countless other challenges for the industry to address. Racism, unconscious bias and the use of fur and other animal-made materials are just some of the issues at play. It's also widely believed within the fashion world that we can expect more painful revelations to contribute to the #MeToo movement. So back to Amed's question: What is there to celebrate?

Visibility. The fact that Akter features on one of BoF's covers is powerful, as is the notable number of non-white cover stars featured across major fashion magazines, from Vogue to Elle, this September (a fashion magazine's September issue is traditionally regarded as the most important of the year).

Virgil Abloh's outlook is also gently uplifting. The 37-year-old Ghanaian-American certainly has reason to be positive about the year so far: In June, he presented his debut collection for Louis Vuitton (aptly titled ""We Are the World""), having been named the brand's artistic director of menswear in March.

""I'm an eternal optimist,"" said Abloh during a phone interview on the day his cover was announced. ""A lot of the things we didn't believe were possible, in terms of access, design and voice, proved to be possible this year.""

Abloh, a trained architect, practicing artist and creative director of his own label, Off-White, is the first black designer to hold such a position at the French fashion house. His appointment was another promising step towards greater diversity and inclusion within the industry, and his debut post-show runway walk, in the gardens of the Palais Royal in Paris, had everyone in attendance on their feet. Some -- including Abloh himself -- were visibly overcome with emotion.

The drive for diversity stretches beyond race. At 3 feet 5 inches tall, Sinead Burke, who recently became a contributing editor at Vogue, joins the BoF 500 list for the first time.

From a young age, Burke saw how powerful fashion could be, in terms of building confidence and empowerment. But she consistently felt left out. In order to address the difficulties faced by disabled people who want to engage with fashion, Burke advocates for the inclusion of more voices. In her opinion, the solution is not to ""design for"" but to ""design with.""

""When we're trying to build solutions to the challenges that exist within product, or within architecture, or fashion, often the assumption is that those in power still have all the solutions,"" she said during an interview in London. ""But actually what we really need is collaboration. (We need to bring) those who are most affected, who have lived the experience, to the table.""

Abloh, seems determinedly focused on youth. His most pressing issue is giving more young creative people a voice. He wants to see more people trained and supported so that they can help ""modernize the system.""

This year's BoF 500 list appears to reflect a similar sentiment, with less of a focus on established talent, and more emphasis on the ""new vanguard,"" as Amed put it. Three scientists are included on this yea's list (Ingvar Helgason, Andras Forgacs and Dan Widmaeir), recognized for using technology to find solutions to fashion's sustainability issues. Musician Troye Sivan also made the cut. The 23-year-old singer-song-writer has become a Gen Z queer icon, talking openly about gay sex in his latest single ""Bloom.""

Much like Abloh's outlook, the list -- and the atmosphere around it -- feels cautiously hopeful. If 2018 was a year of ups and downs, a year of reckoning, perhaps the next 12 months will be defined by increased visibility and inclusion, more demand for accountability from business owners, and a sustained trajectory of positive change."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180907090013-01-bof-magazine-cover-the-activist-super-tease.jpg

""There would be no Internet without pornography,"" proclaimed New York-based Marilyn Minter, whose art has challenged notions of femininity since the 1970s. ""And (porn) is one of the huge engines of the culture.""

It's the sort of outspoken opinion one now expects from 70-year-old Minter, an artist long at the forefront of conversations around the depiction of women in art and media.

Her latest exhibition, now on show at Hong Kong's Lehmann Maupin gallery, is typical in its raw portrayal of women. Focusing on what Minter describes as ""21st century bathers,"" the show brings traditional imagery of women bathing and grooming themselves from art history into the present.

""We're used to seeing an art history of bather...women in nature, Greeks, all the way to the Expressionists and Impressionists, women constantly grooming themselves,"" said Minter during an interview at the gallery.

""And I wanted to bring it into the 21st century. So I have the bather in the shower.""

The hyper-realistic works depict women showering behind steamed glass (which they have drawn on or are in the midst of licking). The glass acts as a ""metaphorical"" boundary between the image and the viewer.

According to Minter, each painting takes around a year to create. She first shoots a photo, which provides a starting point for the painting, and then applies layers of translucent enamel paint to achieve a sense of depth.

""(It) was a way for me to play around with surfaces and create this illusion of depth,"" Minter said of the dark colors used to bring the steam to life. ""It's about desire, it's about breathing, breath of life.""

Of women, for women

The images in the exhibition, most of which were created between 2016 and 2018, continue the American artist's exploration of women and how they are portrayed.

""I wasn't interested ever in trying to just make another pretty face,"" Minter said of her earlier works, where she would do models' makeup herself.

Marilyn Minter unveils steamy 'shower' images

""I didn't really do it,"" she explained. ""I was thinking in terms of the makeup (that) was just left on. I liked (the) model sweating under the light. I liked to see it run because that's intervening.

""There are no perfect moments.""

These earlier works found inspiration in both pornography and advertising. Some of Minter's most provocative paintings were based on images from hardcore porn movies.

""I was trying to make a case that there are no politically correct fantasies,"" she said.

""I thought it was time for women to own sexual imagery and make sexual imagery for their own pleasure and for their own amusement. And at that time I was picking images from abusive history and repurposing them.""

Minter recalled being branded ""traitorous"" by some feminists, who at the time considered her bold paintings to be counter-productive. But she maintains that her art is empowering -- especially in the age of #MeToo.

Once an insular industry trade event, New York Fashion Week has transformed into a high-priced, fast-paced, public-facing marketing opportunity. Shows are livestreamed, Instagrammed and live-tweeted, immediately transmitting what happens on the runway to the masses.

With social media helping to democratize the industry, conversations surrounding fashion week aren't always centered on the clothing. Here are five of the wider conversations spurred by the Spring-Summer 2019 event.

Diversity on the runway

The fashion industry is, like our culture at large, increasingly engaged in discussions around representation. More than ever, designers are being forced to consider who should be seen -- or excluded -- on the runway and why.

Chromat founder Becca McCharen-Tran has long championed broader inclusion by casting a diverse range of femme, female-identified and gender non-binary models on her runways, featuring people of all different shapes, sizes, ages and abilities. This season, her models wore swimwear and athletic apparel, inspired by the idea of wearing T-shirts at pool parties in an effort to hide one's body.

Elsewhere, British artist Patrick Church confronted ageism with a series of printed bodysuits, crop tops and skin-tight wares that were modeled exclusively by older women. Tome's models -- wearing sustainable menswear-inspired pieces -- also represented a variety of different age groups. Meanwhile

Shanel Campbell, who has dressed the likes of Solange and Teyana Taylor, made her event debut with an all-black cast of models, and a predominantly black team working behind the scenes. And Marco Marco Underwear, which presented everything from evening gowns to sheer bodysuits, hired an all-trans lineup. The show reportedly made history by assembling the largest group of trans men ever used in a runway show at New York Fashion Week.

T-shirts as political billboards

Fashion has always been political. But in recent years, designers have become less discreet with their words.

Jeremy Scott, for example, sent out a 62-look show (seemingly aimed at club kids) featuring words like ""resist"" and ""riot"" in a comic-book font. The designer then took his bow in a T-shirt urging attendees to contact their senators in protest against Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the US Supreme Court.

""Project Runway"" alumnus Christian Siriano may best known for gowns and evening dresses, but he too found space in his lineup for a political T-shirt. It directed guests to ""Vote For Cynthia,"" referring to New York's gubernatorial candidate, Cynthia Nixon, who was seated on the front row (and who was today defeated in the Democratic primary, despite Siriano's best efforts).

Kerby Jean-Raymond, of the buzzy label Pyer Moss, used slogans like ""See Us Now?"" in his range -- particularly potent, given that his brand is dedicated to celebrating and elevating the experiences of African Americans. One of his line's most talked-about designs was a simple graphic tee printed with the words ""Stop Calling 911 On The Culture,"" a reference to recent high-profile incidents of unnecessary and racially motivated calls being made to US police. The $125 item went on to sell out within a day of release.

Pitch-perfect collaborations

With high fashion increasingly taking its cues from the streetwear market -- which prizes partnerships and ""drops"" -- it's no surprise that there were a number of collaborations on show.

Luxury label The Blonds, known for its over-the-top looks, partnered with Disney on a collection inspired by the studio's villains. Yes, Maleficent, Ursula and Cruella de Vil all got their runway moments on the backs of Paris Hilton, Leiomy Maldonado and Patrick Starr, among others.

Streetwear label Kith welcomed brands like Ugg, New Balance and Levi's to its roster of collaborators, in addition to producing collections for Tommy Hilfiger and Greg Lauren. In an unexpected twist, the label also unveiled a 24-look capsule collection with Versace, featuring fur jackets, sweatsuits, biker shorts and more.

The fashion show as 'happening'

With the over-proliferation of fashion shows and the growing role of social media, brands are opting for increasingly dramatic fashion week productions. What may have once been a simple catwalk show is now a high-wattage fete, complete with dancers, drones and live musicians.

To that end, Telfar, winner of the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund award in 2017, held its show on a helipad near the East River. Featuring the likes of Selah Marley and Moses Sumney, and presided over by singer Ian Isiah and South African duo Faka, the event saw audiences watched behind a chain-link fence while performers roamed freely around a drum set.

New York label Opening Ceremony put on a performance -- though one of a different kind altogether. Founders Humberto Leon and Carol Lim recruited drag queen Sasha Velour to curate a line-up of performers to showcase the brand's new wares, including notable queens like Shea Coulee and Hungry, as well as non-drag talent like Christina Aguilera.

Ralph Lauren arguably went the biggest (it was the brand's 50th anniversary, after all). He took the industry to Central Park's Bethesda Terrace, where the likes of Hillary Clinton, Kanye West and Donna Karan listened to Oprah pay tribute to the designer. The fashion veteran also turned out a casting that spanned a range of ages and races, as well as a collection showing the company's breadth, from Polo Sport and RRL to women's evening wear.

Rihanna steals the spotlight

Rihanna closed out New York Fashion Week with a show for her lingerie and intimates line, Savage X Fenty. And while the event started late (the organizers were waiting for editors to arrive from the delayed Marc Jacobs show), it has attracted almost universal praise.

The show dovetailed many of the week's trends: It was an elaborate production with dancers, runway choreography, an incredibly produced set and an expansive line-up of models representing a variety of colors and sizes -- including two pregnant models.

If Rihanna's celebrity glow wasn't enough, she also cast Bella and Gigi Hadid. With the livestream repeating lines like ""We know beauty and brains are not mutually exclusive,"" and, ""We know that we can be as competent in the boardroom as the bedroom,"" the entire production was -- as Rihanna herself called it when speaking with Vogue -- ""a celebration of womanhood."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180913105307-savage-fenty-fw18-1-super-tease.jpg

There's a memorable picture of Donna Gottschalk that is circulated in some corners of the internet. In the photo, taken by photojournalist Diana Davies at 1970 Christopher Street Liberation Day parade in New York (America's first gay pride parade), she is blonde, short-haired, 20, and carrying a sign of her own design that reads ""I am your worst fear I am your best fantasy."" Her expression is defiant.

When this photo was taken, Gottschalk was just beginning her own photographic practice. In the decades that followed, she would focus her lens on pockets of the lesbian community that were often ignored by the masses, from radical organizers in New York and lesbian separatists in San Francisco, to a rural commune in Maine.

Though she was born and raised on New York's Lower East Side and studied art at the prestigious Cooper Union in the 1960s, she was far removed from the glamorous queer-friendly enclaves the mainstream lapped up. You wouldn't find her at Andy Warhol's tabloid-feeding Factory; the Chelsea Hotel, where the likes of Robert Mapplethorpe, William Burroughs and Gore Vidal worked and played; or the lofty private parties where closeted women led their double-lives.

""The people that I was taking pictures of were not people that, ordinarily, people thought to photograph. They were my personal friends and family,"" she said on the phone from her Victory, Vermont farm, where she lives with her long-term partner. Though she left New York for good in 1979, her accent is thick.

While some of her friends would go on to some form of notoriety (award-winning documentary photographer Joan E. Biren is a longtime friend; so is the poet Judy Grahn), many lived their lives on the margins of the margins. They were poor, transgender, homeless; sex workers, addicts, survivors of abuse. In Gottschalk's intimate portraits, taken in bedrooms, kitchens and yards, they're given a beauty in humanity they were otherwise denied.

She traces her inspiration back to Diane Arbus, Irving Penn and August Sander, ""the masters that were intrigued by portraiture of people -- real portraiture, not commercial photography. You know, they didn't set up a shop and say come in here and we'll make it look good and take your portrait.""

Like them, she was drawn to marginalized groups, and prioritized personality over artifice. But sharing her work with the public, as her idols did, was never her primary intention. (There was one group show at the Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco in the early '70s, but ""nothing ever came of that."") Instead, she wanted to create personal keepsakes. She'd tell sitters suspicious of her camera: ""If I get to be old, I want to remember you. I want to remember you just the way you are now.""

""I had a portent that most of the people that I was taking pictures of wouldn't live, wouldn't make it. They were poor. There were no safety nets,"" she explained. ""At the time, in the 1970s, (my work) wasn't happy-happy stuff. It wasn't what people wanted, I think, or needed. The lesbian community needed to see (that) we're not all miserable; you can thrive.""

But now, whatever her original plans, she's been given her first solo show, ""Brave, Beautiful Outlaws: The Photographs of Donna Gottschalk"" at New York's Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art. The exhibition includes 37 photos, selected with curator Deborah Bright, and the museum has acquired 10 for their permanent collection.

Gottschalk said it was timing more than anything that convinced her to take the risk after all these years. She says most of the people she photographed are dead. Many died young and broke. Also, ""I'm almost 69, you know, and I didn't know what the heck would happen to (my archive). I'm getting up there.""

The interest in her work, including coverage in the New York Times, W magazine and Wallpaper, has her ""completely floored.""

""I'm very happy, very much so, because many of the people who are photographed in that show... these are people who just disappear,"" she said. ""And I am so happy that they're going to be in a museum for the rest of the time that the museum exists.""

With proud, wistful expressions, the elderly figures in Peter Bos' portraits seem gentle enough -- kind, even. But the men's tattoos belie a darker truth: They were once fearsome headhunters whose facial markings symbolize the decapitation of their foes.

These are members of the Konyak tribe, a group of approximately 230,000 people living in the Indian state of Nagaland, close to the Myanmar border. Inhabiting remote hilltop villages, these agricultural communities often used patterned body markings to celebrate major milestones and rites of passage.

Face tattoos, however, were reserved for warriors -- specifically those returning from conflicts or raids with enemy heads.

""I never felt intimidated or threatened -- they were very warm,"" recalled Bos, a Dutch portrait photographer, in a phone interview. ""We think of headhunting as something evil or rough, but for them it was more just a way of living.

""We went into their houses, spent time with them and asked about their past -- about their poems, sayings and songs -- which made it easier for them to feel relaxed in front of the camera,"" said Bos, who shot the aging headhunters over four visits to the region.

""But the old men were very fragile, and had a sadness in them.""

The tribesmen's body art is slowly fading from sight, both literally and figuratively. Since Christian missionaries arrived in the region during the second half of the 19th century, headhunting and the accompanying tattoo ritual have been gradually consigned to history.

Both practices were effectively eliminated by the 1970s, according to Phejin Konyak, the great-granddaughter of a headhunter, who has spent almost four years documenting her tribe's disappearing culture.

""Every tattoo pattern depicts someone's status or cycle of life,"" the 38-year-old said in a phone interview from Nagaland. ""What I did was record all of the existing patterns, so they are not lost. (I also documented) the oral traditions, like songs and poems, to capture them at a moment when it's all vanishing.

""These people are the last bearers of this tradition, and when they die it will be gone forever.""

A 'living library'

Konyak's research -- which includes illustrations of tattoo designs and their meanings -- appears alongside Bos' photographs in the pair's new book, ""The Konyaks: Last of The Tattooed Headhunters."" The work also details the tribe's customs, rituals and social structures, charting the arrival of British missionaries and the disappearance of animist beliefs and shamanism.

The author's personal history informs her self-professed ""mixed feelings"" toward Christianity. Having left her 700-person village at the age of 4, Konyak was educated at a convent school in Dimapur, almost 300 kilometers away.

The patterns used for facial tattoos vary between different Nagaland villages. Credit: Peter Bos

""Of course, it brought us education -- and I wouldn't have written this book if I didn't get a modern education,"" she said. ""But in Nagaland the conversion to Christianity and the exposure to modernity has been very rapid. It just happened suddenly. We've gone from headhunting to iPads in the span of a few (decades).""

There is a certain irony to Konyak's mission: Her great-grandfather, Ahon, reportedly helped end headhunting by working with the British to broker peace between warring tribes. But while the author welcomes the end of a violent practice, she fears that much else has also been swept away.

The fate of traditional tattoos, which were hand-tapped into the skin using sharpened rattan canes and tree sap pigment, is symptomatic of a wider cultural erosion, Konyak said.

""Even old folk songs ... are seen as nothing important,"" she added. ""If only we could take the good things of the past and mix them with the new lifestyle.

""I think there should be a balance. We cannot remain isolated; we have to adapt to changing times. But if we lose our identity, then what's the purpose?""

Some of Bos' subjects assumed traditional clothing, while others are pictured wearing sportswear or modern accessories. Credit: Peter Bos

Konyak believes that there is ""no chance"" of her tribe's lost traditions being revived, though she sees value in recording what she describes as a ""living library."" In addition to producing an illustrated children's version of the book, she is having her work translated into one of the tribe's dialects (although because the Konyaks' languages have no written form, this means painstakingly transliterating an oral dialect into Latin script).

""Preservation has to come internally, from within the local population,"" she said. ""Unless there's a drive from within the tribe, then there's little chance of (traditions surviving).""

Contrasting worlds

For Bos, the juxtaposition of old and new provided rich visual material. Many of his subjects assumed traditional clothing -- even inserting antlers or tusks into their ears -- while others are pictured wearing sportswear or modern accessories.

The portraits were often shot inside traditional longhouses, which are made from bamboo, palm leaves and wood from the surrounding hills.

""Their longhouses are very beautiful,"" he said. ""They're very dark inside, but they all have this hunting-trophy wall with all the skulls of animals. They keep all of the heads, apart from the (old) human ones that are not allowed by the church anymore. And the bamboo structures just make for a beautiful backdrop.""

Bos also captured everyday life in the region's villages, which he visited for up to six weeks at a time. But it's his portraits -- which include his collaborator's own great-aunt and great-uncle -- that seem to embody the spirit of the book.

""They were still alive, but time had caught up with them,"" he said of the elderly villagers.

""They were not really of this world anymore."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180821120630-headhunters-of-nagaland-5-super-tease.jpg

In a striking image by Korean photographer Nina Ahn , a solitary figure stands by a window, street lights glimmering around her. Another shows a woman in her 20s sitting alone on a guardrail beside an empty highway in Seoul.

The photographs are intended to capture the loneliness of South Korea's youth -- specifically a subculture referred to as ""honjok,"" a neologism combining the words ""hon"" (alone) and ""jok"" (tribe).

The term is often used to describe a generation that embraces solitude and independence, reflecting the country's growing number of single-person households and changing attitudes towards romance, marriage and family.

""It's a sense of giving up,"" Ahn said in a phone interview from Seoul. ""We live in a generation where simply working hard for a bright future doesn't guarantee happiness, so why not invest in 'me' time?

""The fact that my photos carry a sentiment of dreariness means that (it) is the face of the current generation.""

Photographer Hasisi Park also explores isolation among young South Koreans in her work. She often depicts her subjects as powerless beings in the great wilderness or society at large.

Park, who is also based in Seoul, attributes the rise of ""honjok"" to the social pressures of the modern age, namely limited opportunities to interact with others and a lack of time to dedicate to oneself.

""The society we live in can be very unstable, and I think young people don't want to be compromised anymore,"" she said in an email interview.

Redefining the family

There were over 5 million single-person households in South Korea as of 2016, accounting for almost 28% of the total number of households, according to the Korean Statistical Information Service . For Michael Breen , author of the book ""The New Koreans: The Story of a Nation,"" this development is at odds with the historical traditions of Korean society.

""I think it is a natural consequence of democracy and economic development,"" he said in a phone interview. ""In a lot of Asian societies, individual interests and rights have been subordinated to those of family or group organizations. But the longer you exist with democracy the more their values would become individualistic over collective.

""When I first came to Korea in the '70s, every Korean I knew had five or six siblings, and they all came from large families,"" Breen added. ""You would usually see a lot of relatives living in the same village.""

But a growing middle class, coupled with government efforts to promote family planning, has contributed to a dramatic drop in the country's fertility rate -- from 6.1 births per woman in 1960 to just 1.2 in 2015, according to World Bank data. Women, in particular, are moving away from traditional notions of family and the perceived burden of raising children, Breen said.

""With the (prospect of) added pressure from the in-laws, a lot of women opt out from the idea of marriage,"" he said.

The growth of individualism can be a source of contentment, according to Jang Jae Young, manager of a website dedicated to the single lifestyle, honjok.me

""Our parents' generation was busy putting bread on the table,"" he said in an email interview. ""They had to sacrifice themselves to feed their families and contribute to the economy.

""But now there is a stronger desire for self-realization and happiness, even if that means being alone.""

Changing priorities

Although Ahn's photographs portray a palpable loneliness, she believes that her contemporaries are more willing to enrich their lives through experiences like travel.

""In our parents' generation, people knew that after working hard and saving up for certain number of years, they would be able to buy a house for their family,"" she said.

""But we came to a realization that we'll never be able to own anything like that, even if we work for our entire lives.

""(My peers) know that there is no happily-ever-after, and they are responding to life in a wiser way. Our priorities in life have changed.""

According to Park, who also produces intimate portraits of family life, the ""honjok"" generation is now an economic force in its own right. From one-person apartments to restaurants catering to unaccompanied diners, Korean society is increasingly geared toward young singles.

""(It) has gotten big enough to form a culture with consumer power,"" she said.

Yet Jang, who created the site after living alone in Seoul for over 10 years, sees growing individualism as a double-edged sword.

""I hope it grows into a self-supporting culture of happiness, but South Korea is suffering from low birth rate, becoming a super aged society,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say it is only a positive phenomenon."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180703160541-nina-ahn-6-super-tease.jpg

The scenes could scarcely look more mundane: young South Koreans, disinterested by the camera's presence, shop for groceries or sit by the pool.

But, faced with injustice around them, bearing witness to lives lived with resilient normality can be a radical act, says curator Antwaun Sargent, pointing to the photographs by Gowun Lee, part of a new group exhibition at Aperture , the New York photography gallery.

""What you see in these images is a shift in society.""

Lee's subjects are queer -- an umbrella term for sexual and gender identities that are not heterosexual or cisgender -- their sexual identity resulting in many facing discrimination, violence, or cultural erasure in South Korea, where conservative attitudes to gender and sexuality prevail. But her simple images contain within them a statement of resistance, says Sargent: we're here and not going anywhere.

""That's a call -- embedded in those images -- for a society to do more, to be more open, to be more tolerant,"" he says. ""To really understand the plight of queer people and to make changes that make that a more prideful society.""

Shifting social attitudes

The exhibition, titled ""The way we live now,"" is made up 18 photographers and artists, whose images document shifting social attitudes and the overlapping battles over the truths we live by in this moment of social and political change.

As the USA and many countries around the world finds themselves embroiled in conflicts over rampant inequality, reactionary right-wing politics, and escalating nationalism, the show aims to present a rising generation resisting the simple divisions of the past.

Amid the madness of daily news, there are new truths emerging, shared among a generation who are less divided than ever by national borders and more connected online: an openness to diverse sexual identities, a compassionate understanding of drugs and addiction, and an opposition to mass incarceration.

Selected from over one thousand submissions received after an open call by organizers Aperture, the exhibition includes photographers from across the globe, addressing intersecting issues including race, sexuality, mental health, government oppression, and resistance.

Different generations

The Bubblegum Collective capture South Africa, 14 years after the end of Apartheid, through portraits of young artists, designers, and activists. Lili Kobielski documents Cook County Jail in Chicago, a jail that has become one of the state's biggest mental healthcare providers. Diego Camposeco documents Latin American communities in American South, creating a rich picture of a community who have little voice.

Sargent says he has enjoyed participating in the conversations between people of different generations that the exhibition has brought to the fore.

He took a friend's mother in her late 50s to see the photographs by Camilia Falcao that show transgender women at various stages in the process of transition.

""For her, where trans-ness is a relatively new concept, she's trying to go: 'is this a man or is this a woman?'"" says Sargent.

""What she was doing was not being ignorant, she was looking for the traditional marker of what constitutes a female, a woman. And so I said to her that the very nature of that project is that sexual identity, gender, for our generation has not been something that is tethered to a body part.""

""That's a totally radically different definition of what it means to be a woman, that what previous generations would have had.""

Bucking tradition

The way we live now -- which takes its name from a bitter satire of a corrupt political establishment by Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope -- pre-empts these kind of inter-generational conversations.

By working within the style and photographic traditions of the 20th century, they can question the certainties that underlie much documentary photography of previous generations, says Sargent.

Like Luther Konadu, a Canadian photographer who composes shots of young friends sitting round the table to resemble the photography of Carrie Mae Weems. Konadu uses the same framing but wants to provoke viewers to question how stories are created by Weems and by any photographer.

""There is, in some ways, this 'bucking' of tradition and doing thing differently,"" says Sargent

Most direct is Jonathan Gardenhire, an artist based in New York, whose images question the knowledge handed down from previous generations.

His photographs include within them classic books, such as the historically acclaimed 1986 ""Black Book"", a collection of images of African American men, whose author -- white photographer Robert Mapplethorpe -- has more recently been criticized for ""exoticizing"" his black subjects.

""What he's asking is: 'What have we done with this knowledge?' This knowledge that has been put into the cannon and revered and cited, over and over and over again,"" says Sargent.

As many of the photographers in the show ask, more or less directly, which of the truths of the past do we keep and which to we throw away?"	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180724111106-aperture-tease-super-tease.jpg

Slovakian photographer Maria Švarbová has had her colorful work shown in galleries and festivals around the world, from Milan to Mexico City.

In 2014, aware of Švarbová's interest in architecture and public spaces, a friend suggested she scope out an 80-year-old pool in her hometown of Zlaté Moravce that had once belonged to a local high school. Though it had been closed for more than a decade, Švarbová was surprised to find the pool full and the space pristine.

""When I saw the first swimming pool, I was definitely fascinated by the architecture of this large open space,"" she said on the phone from Bratislava. ""I prefer swimming pools that are old and without reconstruction. I can see a timelessness.""

Švarbová said that all of the pools she photographed (13 pools in 13 Slovakian cities) were built between 1920 and 1970. Their stark colors, repetitive lines, spaciousness and lack of ornamentation exemplify the functionalist architecture that dominated the region from 1948 to 1989, when Slovakia -- then part of the former Czechoslovakia -- was a communist state.

Where some might see coldness, Švarbová saw opportunity.

""For me, it's sci-fi, it's futuristic,"" she said. ""I like to combine in my work old things -- for example, (buildings) from the (communist) era -- with modern things. I would like to show people something new, where there is old and new with each other.""

She enlisted models in primary-colored swimsuits to adopt angular positions inspired by the Spartakiads, mass gymnastic events organized by the communist government where thousands of participants performed routines in unison.

In post-production, bodies were multiplied, colors were enhanced and asymmetrical elements were erased. The carefully composed result is both serene and surreal; an imperfect world, unnervingly perfected.

In Pursuit of Rare is a new series telling the stories of the master makers who deal in the most precious things on earth.

While most vintage car enthusiasts seek to return vehicles to their former glory, Jonathan Ward prizes and preserves the beauty in their decay, while hiding some high tech secrets under the hood.

Ward is the founder of ICON, a California-based company that reimagines classic SUVs like Toyota FJs and Ford Broncos with modern tech and materials.

Icon

While that remains the bulk of the business, Ward has another, more unusual passion project: take vintage cars and, instead of restoring it to the way that it would have looked and driven when it was created, preserve the decay that has occurred through the years but update the vehicle to a cutting-edge driving experience. It's a project he calls ""Derelict.""

""The whole idea of the Derelict series is that we do a lot of work to make it look like we did no work. We want to capture the beauty that is only possible through time earned patina. So that natural decay and all the coloration, because every scuff, every dent tells a story,"" he said.

Icon

Each commission is completely one-of-a-kind, and Apple's Jonathan Ive is reputed to be among the clients. Once concept is settled, then begins the process of finding these very specific models.

""Once we get the green light, I put out an APB to a network of hunters that work for us that help us track down these vehicles. It could be everything from a simple online ad through to package delivery service employees that we work with because they're in everyone's garage or even a couple of firemen so they kind of know what's hiding here and there, and then we pay a finder's fee to them we bring the vehicle here.""

Icon

This process takes anywhere from 72 hours to two years, and there have even been times where the search had to be abandoned.

To achieve the results Ward so meticulously desires, his technicians and engineers have to employ some pretty unique processes. On the shop floor you'll see everything from aerospace machinery used in the early 1900s for the military, up to the latest in laser technology.

Icon

The result looks like it could have been found in a barn (which it probably was), but on closer inspection every element has been carefully designed and selected to achieve both a uniform aesthetic but also the complete modern driving experience. Imagine a rusty, vintage Thriftmaster pickup truck that drives as fast as a sportscar.

It's a somewhat radical concept in the luxury car industry. ""A lot of people look at the Derelict projects and go, 'Why on earth would anyone spend all that time and money on something that looks, pretty bad?"" So not everyone gets it,"" Ward mused.

Icon

Each year, Icon delivers about 250 vehicles, but the Derelicts are the most rarefied. They only produce around three or four a year so, in total, they have delivered just under two dozen.

""The business model of building the Derelicts is pretty darn stupid. At the end of the year we're lucky to break even on them,"" he admitted.

""We are constantly riding the knife's edge on a design and engineering perspective. Trying to make sure we don't do anything that negates the on road capability while balancing decisions that could hurt the design aesthetic. That is the art form of what we're doing.""

At the height of World War II, the US military commissioned Kodak to produce a new type of color film that could capture infrared waves invisible to the human eye. The resulting photographs, taken during aerial reconnaissance missions, allowed allied forces to distinguish between foliage and the enemy camouflage it concealed.

Now, more than seven decades on, photographic artist Lynda Laird has used precisely the same technology to retell one of the conflict's defining episodes.

Her images of abandoned bunkers were taken along the Normandy coast, where the D-Day landings took place in June 1944. Because vegetation reflects a large amount of infrared, the leaves, grass and bushes in her photographs appeared bright red when the film was developed.

But while the colors evoke images of violence and bloodshed, it was the history of this photographic technique that initially inspired the idea.

""I didn't know what was going to happen with the film,"" said Laird during a phone interview. ""It's very variable, and depends on which filters you choose. Sometimes it's much pinker, sometimes the colors are more yellow -- I didn't know until I got the film back and (thought) 'wow, the reds do really feel like blood, and it's quite aggressive.'

""For me, that's why it works quite well. But that wasn't the plan. It was much more about the film being relevant to the work.""

The deep shades of red offer a stark visual contrast to the grey concrete structures and blue skies behind them. Another powerful juxtaposition is created between the stillness of the scenes Laird captures and the horrors that once unfolded around them.

""They were really peaceful and tranquil,"" the 36-year-old said. ""A lot of the bunkers have become part of the landscape, in that there are plants growing all over them. Some of them are really still quite brutal, but even the ones that are on the beach are sinking into the sand -- it's like nature has taken them over.""

A ground-level history of war

The infrared photographs form part of a wider multimedia project that revisits Operation Overlord, the code name used for the Battle of Normandy. Commissioned by the town of Deauville, a seaside resort occupied by the Nazis during the war, Laird's ""Dans Le Noir"" (or ""In the Dark"") also features maps and videos.

Courtesy Lynda Laird

At the center of Laird's story is a series of diary extracts written by Odette Brefort, a member of the French resistance who lived in Deauville during the war.

""Since midnight it's been impossible to sleep: the humming from planes, the anti-aircraft bombs, the machine gun noise,"" Brefort wrote in one diary entry. ""I went downstairs because I couldn't sleep and after 15 minutes it went quiet. Thinking it would be better, I went back to bed. What a mistake!""

She goes on to describe the ""deafening"" fighting that took place, before a power cut plunged Deauville into darkness. Laird presents the diary extracts alongside elaborate maps that Brefort made for fellow members of the resistance detailing the location of enemy forces.

""When we remember (the war), we look at soldiers and people who fought,"" Laird said, ""and it's often missed that people were living through it -- what role they took on and the impact it had on them.""

Laird's project includes a series of videos shot in the seas off Normandy at the exact time of day the landings took place, her lens partially submerged by the water. The Scottish photographer has collected sand and seawater from the area for a future installation, and she hopes to create new sound recordings in time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day next year.

""Photography was my starting point, but now I go out and record sounds first,"" said Laird. ""I do a lot of research and I read a lot of archives, (which are) really important to my practice.

""A lot of my work is to do with memory and a sense of place, trying to look at what's invisible in a landscape -- what you can feel and what you can sense."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180619152922-d-day-bunker-7-super-tease.jpg

Reduced to just their facades, the otherwise unremarkable buildings in Zacharie Gaudrillot-Roy's photographs take on a surreal new quality. The eerie, sparsely populated pictures appear to play into the French photographer's self-professed aim of creating ""confusion between fiction and reality.""

Gaudrillot-Roy has spent almost a decade producing the digitally manipulated images as part of his ongoing series, ""Façades."" But while his focus on frontages can be interpreted as a commentary on architecture, he instead wants viewers to share his curiosity about what might lie behind.

""My feeling is like (that of being) a spectator,"" he said in a phone interview, ""as if I was wandering in a city that I could know. But it's not real, as if I was a stranger.""

The result is an almost dystopian vision of urban and suburban scenes -- fictional structures reminiscent of Russia's ""Potemkin villages,"" or fake settlements, that were designed to give the illusion of life and prosperity. Credit: Zacharie Gaudrillot Roy

""Most of the time, you don't go into buildings that you don't know, You don't speak to people you don't know,"" he added.

Gaudrillot-Roy's creative process begins simply enough: wandering the streets in search of structures that capture his imagination. Having photographed the buildings from a variety of angles, he then uses image manipulation software to erase their volumes and digitally extend the backdrops behind.

""I'm really influenced by cinema,"" he said, admitting that this connection to film was, at first, a happy accident. ""I was not thinking about (this) at the beginning, but now that's why I take pictures by night.""

Most of the images were taken in the 32-year-old photographer's home city of Lyon, south eastern France, where he co-founded the photography gallery and workshop L'Abat-Jour (or ""The Lampshade"").

Others were shot in Montreal, Canada, or around the Swiss town of Porrentruy, where he recently completed an artist residency.

Gaudrillot-Roy has created around 30 of the images to date, and hopes to expand the series with images of Lithuania's second-largest city, Kaunas.

Supermodel and designer Claudia Schiffer is CNN Style's guest editor. She's commissioned a series of features around the theme of icons and iconic imagery. The opinions in this video belong to the individuals featured.

Donatella Versace is one of the fashion industry's most recognizable figures. Versace's fans call her an icon, a title that was further established at the Fashion Awards hosted in London at the end of last year when she received the Fashion Icon award.

The moment capped off a successful year for Versace's artistic director who wowed the fashion industry and fans online when she staged a special tribute to her late brother, and the brand's founder, Gianni Versace, during the label's Spring-Summer 2018 show during Milan Fashion week in September.

Marking 20 years since her brother's murder in 1997, the show brought together Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Helena Christensen and Carla Bruni, who walked arm in arm down the catwalk during the finale as George Michael's ""Freedom"" played.

On the eve of the latest round of shows during Milan Fashion Week, Donatella Versace's name and image remain firmly in the public eye, with Ryan Murphy's ""American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"" in which Penelope Cruz plays the role of Donatella Versace, undoubtedly contributing to the spike in interest.

But it's her contribution to the fashion industry and influence extending far beyond the sector that makes Donatella Versace an icon in the eyes of many. The sheer green, navel-deep dress that she designed for Jennifer Lopez for the 2000 Grammy Awards is regarded as the reason Google Image Search exists

More recently, she created all of the costumes for Lady Gaga's 2012-2013 ""Born this Way"" tour. And in 2015 she modeled Ricardo Tisci's Autumn-Winter 2015 Givenchy campaign. Tisci, who was creative director of Givenchy at the time said in a statement, ""I approached my friend Donatella because she represents what a Fashion Icon is to me.""

The Calanque de Sormiou beach, a beautiful cove at the bottom of a winding descent through a nature reserve near Marseille, is where French fashion designer Simon Porte Jacquemus chose to debut his first menswear collection to the world.

Staged on the sand inches away from gently lapping water during magic hour on a June evening, guests were assigned beach towels to sit on or directed toward large rocks to clamber up onto for a view of the show. The front row was jagged, unkempt and hardly policed in the way that a traditional front row in Paris or London might be. The Mediterranean Sea stretched out beyond the runway, providing a perfectly blue backdrop.

Why Jacquemus chose to present his collection in such a stunning location wasn't difficult to interpret. When asked, he confirmed he was looking for paradise but also somewhere that was accessible. ""This is not a luxury resort or anything like this, it's just a paradise for everyone,"" he said.

The atmosphere was remarkably relaxed and utterly different to the feel of a traditional Paris Fashion Week catwalk presentation. Shoes were removed, people smoked cigarettes and ate ice cream as they waited for the show to begin. Children swam nearby, refreshingly unaware of getting in photographers' shots.

'The little brother of the Jacquemus woman'

To some, it might have seemed risky to show your first menswear collection so far from the center of activity in the capital, but Jacquemus seemed firm. ""There's no sensuality in Paris, to me, so that's why I've brought people here.""

After presenting La Bomba (he names all of his collections) during the Paris shows in September, his celebration of confident and sophisticated female sensuality was secured, and the imagery of barely there dresses and figure-celebrating silhouettes was still vivid in our minds.

So the expectation was that he would present an equally sexy male character during his debut. But there was a difference. According to Jacquemus, the man he presented was ""more like the little brother of the Jacquemus woman. ... He's just starting; he's still very young.""

The collection, named Le Gadjo, captures the spirit and diversity of men from the South of France. Jacquemus, born in Provence, returns to the area often, and his Instagram feed is largely a tribute to long days on the beach, his family and the unique color palette of the region.

Sandy hues, striking blues, olives and orange shades sampled from coastal sunsets made their way down the runway. Casual tailoring mixed with swimwear and tracksuits; the knitwear was laid-back, the sort of thing you would throw on after showering the sand off on a cooler summer evening.

The cast of models was diverse and gorgeously youthful. Staying on afterward to hang out, a group of models gathered on the rocks playing music on their iPhones as the sun set. From a distance they looked like local teenagers.

Jacquemus doesn't work with casting directors, preferring to find his models in more organic ways, on Instagram or through friends. ""I don't like casting directors,"" he said. ""I like someone or not, you know, and of course the idea was to have a lot of Mediterranean guys, but there were no rules.""

Women for his mother, men for his lover

The designer has often said that the Jacquemus woman was for his mother, who passed away when he was just 18. When asked why he chose to pursue a menswear collection now, his answer was simple. ""I fell in love one year ago, and it gave me the energy to tell a story about a man.""

After the show, guests made their way along a path that led to a small harbor area where drinks were served and a trio of guitarists provided the entertainment. Locals from the nearby houses mixed with fashion editors and friends of Jacquemus. Love was in the air."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180629112742-jacquemus-menswear-tease-4-super-tease.jpg

Sometimes, fashion's greatest power is its stealth -- its ability to turn up in unlikely places, on unlikely people, and in the smallest details. Consider the case of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the 85-year-old force of nature who sits on the Supreme Court.

Ginsburg learned long ago how to stand out. Forging her distinguished career at a time when women were not seen as appropriate candidates for law school, let alone judgeships, Ginsburg succeeded in being taken seriously, in remaining visible. And she has devoted herself to helping others do the same: advocating for those society tends to overlook, those ""disappeared"" by the blindness of prejudice or sexism.

Today, as a Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg continues to stand out -- literally, visually -- by virtue of the decorative collars that she famously affixes to her judicial robes.

Beyond a feminizing touch

Given her historic position and stature -- she's the second female justice, appointed in 1993 -- you might think that Ginsburg would have little need for such sartorial distinction. Yet, her collars make crucial symbolic points, albeit subtly.

In adopting the collar, Ginsburg was following a tradition established by Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's first woman (appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981), who sought to feminize her robe with a simple white lace jabot. Ginsburg though, expanded the concept, amassing an entire wardrobe of collars, collected from around the world, in a wide array of styles ranging from simple half-circles of fabric or lace to elaborately beaded and jeweled affairs.

Beyond their role as a feminizing touch, these collars constitute a communication system, a kind of fashion semaphore.

There is her favorite ""majority"" collar (an embellished gold jabot with tiny, delicate pendants) and her ""dissenting"" collar , for example, which instantly telegraph Ginsburg's opinions (to those court observers fluent in ""Ruth"") before a single word can be uttered. (Ginsburg wore her ""dissenting"" collar a day after President Donald Trump's election -- a dark, beaded number composed of long, metallic, finger-like projections, resembling a piece of medieval armor -- throwing sartorial shade while maintaining the official neutrality demanded by protocol).

When espied on the judicial robe, Ginsburg's collars startle the eye a little; they seem incongruous. This is because the traditional black robe inhabits a realm quite far away from both femininity and fashion. Somber, unadorned, and voluminous enough to obscure nearly the entire body, the American judicial robe -- like those worn by clergy, choir singers, or graduates -- is designed to subsume the individual into the collectivity, privileging the institutional body over a specific, human one.

When worn by a group, such as the nine Court justices, the robe merges distinct persons into a single entity consisting of seemingly disembodied heads, suggesting pure, abstracted intellect -- minds detached from bodies that have been 'disappeared'.

But those disappeared bodies were always expected to be male. The judicial robe -- a pared-down version of British court versions --was created for men. And traditionally, men do not ""wear"" their bodies the way women do; we do not focus on male physicality (at least""straight, white, male physicality) as we do women's. According to the classic dichotomy found in many religious and philosophical traditions, men are figured as ""mind"" or ""spirit,"" while women represent the baser realms of ""body"" and ""flesh.""

Re-injecting the 'body' into judicial robes

To clothe the law in a garment that so obscures the body is not a politically neutral act. On the contrary, it carries with it the potentially dangerous assumption that bodies can be easily overlooked, that we know so well what they are, that we can move beyond them.

This risks perpetuating the traditional presumption that the justices' bodies will always be the ones we expect, the ones resembling those originally meant to wear the robe: straight, white, and male. It also implies that such bodies comprise the only subjects of the law.

Ginsburg's collars forestall such presumptions. By drawing attention to the specific person beneath the robe, they disrupt the amorphous collectivity of nine black-clad jurists. Her collars re-inject the concept of ""body"" into the dis-embodying judicial robe, signaling not only the presence of a woman, but by extension, the presence of a biological human body -- which demands acknowledgment and consideration.

To re-establish the body within the robe is a progressive political statement: Theoretical (and visual) bodiless-ness is a privilege available only to those whose bodies do not hinder them. Those with the most ""noticeable"" bodies (including women, gay people, the disabled, transgender people and people of color) are always, paradoxically, at greater risk of not being noticed by the law -- susceptible to having their needs overlooked (needs for reproductive rights, gender and marriage equality, or racial justice, for example).

Ginsburg's collar reminds us that the law cannot be purely abstract or disembodied -- that fairness requires it to remain attached to all bodies and their needs.

And finally, while the collars quite specifically identify Ginsburg as an individual, they serve another purpose, too: They turn what was a generic male garment into a potentially generic female item as well, inviting future women to occupy it.

This has been literalized in cinemas screening the new documentary ""RBG"" (by Betsy West and Julie Cohen), where pasteboard silhouettes of Ginsburg's judicial robes -- complete with ornate collar -- have been set up. Moviegoers can pose for selfies in ""RBG drag,"" as if wearing the robes themselves. The implied message is clear and inclusive. It says to anyone, especially women and girls: ""Imagine yourself here! This could be you!""

Of course, men still dominate the Supreme Court, six to three, with no change in sight for the moment. And femininity in fashion -- of the sort we see in many of Ginsburg's ruffled or lacy collars -- still codes as decorative, incidental, or girlish, even though Ginsburg is a deeply formidable woman. On other women, frilly adornments -- bows, ruffles, lace, ribbons -- hardly suggest righteous power. This remains a problem -- the decorative suggests the less central, the less important, a side embellishment. Perhaps then it would be liberating to read Ginsburg's frilliness as irony, as permission (or as an invitation) to reclaim femininity in fashion for its subtle, surprisingly undermining power. Now might be the right time to proclaim the dainty lace collar the next pink pussy hat.

In a black and white photo from the 1950s, singer and actress Eartha Kitt is seen dressed in head-to-toe leopard print. She looks defiant and self-assured, while, next to her, a cheetah sits nonchalantly on a leash.

It is an iconic photo. It is also one of the images that, three decades ago, inspired burlesque dancer Jo Weldon to start researching the story and legacy of leopard print. Her findings have been brought together in a new book, ""Fierce: The History of Leopard Print,"" in which Weldon charts the origins, evolution and changing status of one of fashion's most ubiquitous patterns.

""Kitt was a starting point, as I was deeply fascinated by her as a child,"" Weldon said in a phone interview. ""She looked fabulous in her prints -- a strong figure. But she was also a woman of substance. To me, the spots tied both aspects together.""

Leopard motifs -- and feline imagery in general -- have been used to signify power, independence and confidence for centuries, according to Weldon.

""Leopards have long been seen as fierce, very resilient animals."" she said. ""I think people feel a primordial connection with them.""

Historically, leopards have played a prominent role in iconographies around the world. The ""Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük,"" a clay figurine dating back to around 6000 B.C., shows a female figure resting her arm on a leopard.

Seshat, the Egyptian goddess of wisdom, is often pictured wearing a leopard or cheetah hide. And goddess Xi Wangmu, known as the Queen Mother of the West in Chinese mythology, is depicted with the teeth of a tiger and the tail of a leopard.

""During the 18th and 19th centuries, leopard fur and clothes came to signify wealth and status,"" Weldon said. ""Then you enter the 20th century and the start of mass-produced fabrics and garments. The print entered the mainstream, and began having modern significance.""

An evolving trend

Leopard print's reputation has gone through a number of iterations since. It has been deemed low-brow, provocative, tacky and dangerous. It has been worn by starlets and associated with cheap clothing. In pop culture, from movies to music, leopard-clad women have been identified as mean, shallow and loose, which Weldon points out through a series of chapters titled ""The Trophy Wife,"" ""The Bad Mother"" and ""The Femme Fatale.""

Yet, the motif has also been embraced by the upper echelons of fashion. Christian Dior is credited as the first designer to put leopard print -- rather than fur -- on the runway in 1947. Style icons like Josephine Baker, Elizabeth Taylor, Jackie Kennedy and Edie Sedgwick all wore the pattern.

In recent decades, Beyoncé has publicly sported leopard print, as have Anna Wintour and Michelle Obama. And, season after season, fashion magazines hail ""the return of leopard"" on designer catwalks, from Balmain to Armani, Cavalli to Givenchy.

""Leopard print has swayed in so many different directions because it's open to interpretations,"" Weldon said. ""It can be seen as a 'neutral,' that looks great next to bolder colors, but it can also perfectly stand out on its own.""

""Our appreciation of it also goes back to our relationship with the animal: We admire it and fear it, we find it irresistible yet we know it's dangerous. Felines evoke nocturnal activities and playfulness. All of that goes into the print and, by association, to the woman who wears it.""

These dichotomies may explain leopard print's endurance in the public imagination, as well as its ongoing popularity among diverse segments of consumers. Weldon believes the ever-evolving trend is, today, as relevant as ever.

""In all its forms -- sophisticated, luxe, rebellious, sexy -- (the) leopard print makes a statement. It can't be ignored, whether you like it or loathe it. That's why it's still so prominent in mainstream culture.

""At a time when women are being pulled in different directions, and are trying to define and affirm what it means to be a strong woman, the pattern feels relevant. It says 'I want to be seen.'""

Beyoncé's fourth cover of American Vogue was one for history. Not because she was the first black woman on the cover (Beverly Johnson, 1974), not because she was the first black woman to cover a September issue (Naomi Campbell, 1989), and not because she had racked up the most Vogue covers as a black woman (Shari Belafonte and Rihanna both have five). Instead, for the first time in history, the cover of American Vogue was shot by a black photographer: Tyler Mitchell.

""When I first started, 21 years ago, I was told that it was hard for me to get onto covers of magazines because black people did not sell,"" Beyoncé wrote in her extended captions that went along with the imagery. ""Clearly that has been proven a myth. Not only is an African American on the cover of the most important month for Vogue, this is the first ever Vogue cover shot by an African American photographer.""











1 / 6 September's Vogue cover was shot by photographer Tyler Mitchell.

In 126 years of Vogue, the magazine has had various permutations. It started as a weekly, transitioned to a bi-weekly and then finally in 1973 went monthly. Representatives from Condé Nast point to a 1932 cover by Edward Steichen of a woman in a bathing suit as the start of cover photography from the publication, but 1959 brought the first year of all photographic covers, beginning to usher in an era of Vogue as we know it today.

These landmark dates bring context to numbers like 126 years and 1,512 issues of Vogue that are bandied about social media — in fact there have been over 2,800 covers. But even with those clarifications, the lack of black photographers still is a glaring omission.

""Fashion editors in general tend to have a handful of their favorite, reliable photographers whose work, for whatever reason, seems to move or sell copies,"" Valerie Steele the director and chief curator of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology told CNN in a phone interview this week.

""And with the cover it's quite a special issue because they want someone who is going to sell copies of a magazine. They are not going to use anyone who is remotely edgy or different, they want someone who is reliable and is going to look similar to other things."" The commercial viability is increasingly important with the September issue, which has been positioned as the most important issue of the year, as explained in a 2009 documentary. As Steele noted, it is known for having the most advertisements of the year.

The majority of high fashion's most coveted photography is all shot by a small group of photographers. Since beginning to do photographed covers, Vogue estimates that they've given the honor to about 60 people, many of whom were reused.

The late Richard Avedon shot over 140 covers, beginning sporadically in the 1960 and 70s before leading to an almost exclusive period, shooting all but one cover from June 1980 to October 1988. Other names also reappear: Steven Meisel, Patrick Demarchelier, Irving Penn, and Mario Testino amongst them. These names, in kind, also routinely book some of the biggest high fashion ad campaigns.

""I think about how in general most of these photographers are men,"" Antwaun Sargent, an art and culture critic said via phone. ""And how Annie Leibovitz had to be the only one in some ways. This conversation isn't just about race, but it extends to gender and things like age. There's a difference in the ways that men and women shoot the body.""

In records reviewed and information provided by Condé Nast, there are only a handful of female photographers in Vogue's cover history. Annie Leibovitz appears as the only woman to have shot a cover of Vogue solo since Karen Radkai and Frances McLaughlin-Gill in 1950s and Toni Frissell, who preceded them both in the 1930s and 40s. Inez van Lamsweerde has also shot three covers with her partner Vinoodh Matadin since 2017.

To arrive at this point, Vogue (and the high fashion industry at large) has ignored generations of photographers, including some of the black photographers who have informed Mitchell's own work.

""The way that [Tyler] thinks about lighting black skin, his interrogation of blackness in general is something that many generations of photographers have looked at,"" Sargent said, referring to a variety of Mitchell's statements, chief amongst them, one that says he shoots with an ""honest gaze.""

While a few names like Gordon Parks -- Parks was the first black photographer to shoot for Vogue in the 40s -- and Lorna Simpson have shot for Vogue in-book there's plenty more that have not. Photographers like Carrie Mae Weems, Awol Erizku, Mickalene Thomas, Micaiah Carter and Shaniqwa Jarvis, all from a variety of generations, and all black, all with a reputation for shooting commercially, have largely been left out of American Vogue. Jarvis has shot for Supreme, Nike and Adidas — while those brands are not high fashion, they speak to commercial viability. In fact, this summer discussion arose that a shoot Juergen Teller did for an international issue of Vogue mimicked Thomas's trademark aesthetic. Why was Thomas not just hired?

On Instagram, Naomi Campbell spoke to the scarcity of black photographers in high fashion. When stylist Ugo Mozie posted , criticizing Vogue for taking so long to cast a black photographer for the cover, the iconic supermodel commented ""You're correct, it's a disgrace!! In my 32 years, I only got to work with one fashion photographer, this is why I will continue to push for diversity in my industry."" While her agents declined to specify whether Campbell was saying she had only worked with one black fashion photographer at Vogue --she's had seven covers --or in the industry overall, with a career as prolific as hers, the stat is damning. While her agents declined to specify whether Campbell was saying she had only worked with one black fashion photographer at Vogue -- she's had seven covers -- or in the industry overall, with a career as prolific as hers, the stat is damning.

But why is this change coming now?

Before the cover was revealed Huffington Post ran a report that Vogue had ceded control of the cover to Beyoncé. According to the publication, Beyoncé had brought Mitchell to Vogue and as such single handedly initiated this change in history.

""Until there is a mosaic of perspectives coming from different ethnicities behind the lense, we will continue to have a narrow approach and view of what the world actually looks like. That is why I wanted to work with this brilliant 23-year-old photographer Tyler Mitchell,"" she wrote in her cover story. ""If people in powerful positions continue to hire and cast only people who look like them, sound like them, come from the same neighborhoods they grew up in, they will never have a greater understanding of experiences different from their own. They will hire the same models, curate the same art, cast the same actors over and over again, and we will all lose.""

Vogue's recounting paints a different tale. They suggested Mitchell's name to Beyoncé amongst a list of other photographers, and understanding the historical significance, Beyoncé selected the young creative. Mitchell has even supported this version on his Twitter account, in a now deleted tweet. Regardless of which actually happened, the new move extends fashion's long running conversation about representation, finally behind the lens.

For decades, Vogue had no real reason to venture out of the creatives they had been using. Stylists and editors continued to use their go-to photographers. But in the past few years with America's disinterest with print magazines , a slate of sexual assault accusations that caused Condé Nast to distance itself from various photographers and changing conversations in fashion about identity, changes were iminent.

""[My black photography students] have all been saying, we don't really see ourselves out there, in the industry, in photography."" Kimberly Jenkins, a lecturer at Parsons said via phone. ""One of them in particular was saying she wanted to be a photographer because it wasn't only that she didn't see black photographers in fashion but she didn't see any black women photographers.""

That mentality is the latest maturation of a conversation that's been occuring in fashion for over a decade, arguably starting with a call for more diverse castings of models on runways and in ad campaigns. Those calls were soon met with calls for more black designers and stylists and even the hair and makeup teams. But the role of photographer rarely crept into the dialogue.

""It's such a powerful position; you know we're definitely doing the styling now, and we're definitely doing the hair and makeup but to let a person of color, especially a black person, take control of the lens and control the gaze for a major publication? That's a huge responsibility,"" Jenkins said. ""You're guiding [the public] in how we're going to look at something.""

And now, even that shall be through a ""mosaic of perspectives."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180806142657-beyonce-vogue-cover-tyler-mitchell-super-tease.jpg

It wasn't the $12,000 pink pinstripe suit or the $48,000 blue lizard jacket that raised eyebrows. After all, House of Bijan is often described as the most expensive men's clothing store in the world, and Paul Manafort was just another good customer.

It was how Donald Trump's former campaign chairman paid for these couture pieces that caught the attention of the store's 26-year-old CEO and owner, Nicolas Bijan.

""It's not typical to pay by wire transfer from a foreign bank,"" he said in an exclusive interview with CNN. ""A majority of our clients pay by credit card. Occasionally we'll have a client who wants to pay with wire transfer. But that's unusual.""

The wire transfers , reportedly made from bank accounts in Cyprus, were revealed during the first week of Manafort's trial on tax and bank fraud charges. The opening days of the case have centered around the defendant's reportedly lavish lifestyle.

Over a five-year period, Manafort spent a total of $520,000 at House of Bijan. But those purchases were not considered unusual enough for the store to ask Manafort where the money was coming from.

""We don't ask our clients how they come into wealth or where the money is from,"" Bijan said. ""It's none of our business -- that would be overreaching.""

A wealthy clientele

The appointment-only boutique was opened in 1976 by Nicolas Bijan's Tehran-born father, Bijan Pakzad. A universe unto itself, the House of Bijan's Rodeo Drive store is decorated with white marble floors, walls painted in the brand's signature Mediterranean yellow and a Baccarat chandelier adorned with 1,000 crystal bottles of Bijan's fragrances.

""My father always loved color, so when you walk into the store you see these beautiful French antique displays in front of Fernando Botero paintings in these color-coordinated closets,"" Bijan said. ""When you walk in right now, there's a beautiful linen and silk yellow sports jacket displayed with a yellow flower arrangement.""

House of Bijan has dressed an international clientele including the last five US presidents. Bijan said that Donald Trump was once a client of the brand's Fifth Avenue store, which closed nearly two decades ago.

Manafort's wardrobe included a $21,000 limited edition Bijan black titanium ""Royal Way"" wristwatch with crystal, an $18,000 suede beige coat and 18 cotton shirts, in assorted colors, bought for $24,600. Not to mention five silk tie sets costing $6,700.

""To be honest with you,"" Bijan said, ""I think I can fairly say we never even knew what he did for a living.""

While Bijan claimed that Manafort wasn't a top spending client, his purchases date back decades.

""He was a regular and longtime customer,"" Bijan said. ""You can see he has pieces from many years ago, from the 80s and 90s, and even recent pieces that we designed for his collection.""

Internal records, submitted to the court by House of Bijan and as seen by CNN, show that the company's general manager traveled to The Peninsula hotel in New York in April 2011. Manafort ordered $64,700 worth of clothing from the brand's employee during the trip.

""We visit our clients all over the world if they're not available to visit us on Rodeo Drive,"" Bijan said. ""In the last year, I was in Abu Dhabi several times, Jakarta, Indonesia and London quite frequently.""

By appointment only

House of Bijan recently expanded its brick-and-mortar presence, with stores opening in the Wynn Las Vegas casino resort and the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills last year. But while these new shops accept walk-in customers, the Rodeo Drive flagship remains appointment-only.

""This is a very unique business; we may have two clients per day in the boutique,"" Bijan said. ""If we have more than one client in the boutique at the same time, it's chaos.""

On any given day at the House of Bijan, you may see a Rolls-Royce or a pristine Bugatti parked up outside. The oval-shaped, ivy-lined entrance opens into a cozy two-floor boutique.

Once inside, an 18th-century French armoire at first appears to be another piece of furniture. But Bijan's father removed its back and converted it into a secret door that leads to a dressing room.

""That's just part of the shock value we (offer) our customers to make them smile or laugh,"" Bijan said.

All of the clothes sold by Bijan are manufactured by hand in Tuscany, Italy. T-shirts start at $700, tie sets go for $950. Exotic animal skin items can sell for as much as $100,000.

""My father always taught me that (our brand) is not rich enough ... to make things cheap,"" Bijan said. ""There's a lot of mystery behind our brand and a lot of people who criticize Bijan are people who don't understand, because they've simply never been here.""

One-of-a-kind items

For those who have shopped at House of Bijan, it's unlikely they'll see someone else walking around in the same outfit.

""We only make one or two of each piece,"" Bijan said. ""That way you know there's only one or two in the world, and most probably you'll never see someone wearing the same tie as you. For us men -- don't ask why -- psychologically that means a lot to us.""

Bijan took over the company after his father died in 2011, dropping out of California's Pepperdine University to devote himself to the business full time.

""Every man misses his father,"" Bijan said. ""I would love to share details about my life and the business with him. I lost him at a very young age.""

Today, Bijan estimates the store is one of the highest -- if not the highest -- selling store on Rodeo Drive, per square foot. The company does not disclose its revenues.

Whether dressing a president or the president's former campaign chairman, the brand remains neutral when it comes to politics, according to Bijan.

""We don't have partisan issues at Bijan,"" he said. ""Our politics is fashion."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180806232034-bijan-2-super-tease.jpg

Ari Aster's terrifying debut feature ""Hereditary"" begins with an extraordinary opening shot. In a cluttered room, the camera gently zooms in on an elaborate dolls' house, singling out a first-floor bedroom, completed in intricate detail. As the diorama fills the lens, a man -- real, flesh and blood -- walks through the bedroom door, shaking his son out of sleep. The boy is late for his grandmother's funeral.







































1 / 20 ""Hereditary"" -- Ari Aster's debut feature has shot into headlines as arguably this year's scariest movie. Underpinning the drama is a disturbing family home where misdeeds abound and tensions -- domestic and supernatural -- run high. It's indebted to a long line of spooky houses on screen. Scroll through to discover CNN Style's top picks. Credit: A24

The camera moves on, but the mise en scene is established. The uncanny is turned loose, the real and the phantasmagoric emulsified. These characters are the playthings of some external force, the setting a willing conspirator. Home is where the horror is.

Such ideas are not new to the genre, and whether it wants to admit it or not, Aster's film is the convergence of so many of horror's expressions of the domestic sphere. To speak nothing of the plot (and it's best not to) the writer-director exploits everything from Greek tragedy to Gothic literature to 1980s slasher flicks, with dashes of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Don't Look Now"" and ""The Shining"" all stirred into his nightmarish cocktail.

Revolving around a stay-at-home artist untethered by grief, Toni Collette's performance is receiving early Oscar buzz. But every actor needs a stage, and the one conjured by production designer Grace Yun deserves attention -- it too is a character in its own right.

The family home is a profoundly unsettling space, even if we have seen some of these ideas before. This familiarity begs the question: why are we still so scared? And secondly: why do we keep coming back for more?

No safe spaces

French philosopher Gaston Bachelard writes in ""The Poetics of Space,"" ""If one would ask us what is the most precious benefaction of the house, we would say: the house accommodates dreaming, the house protects the dreamer, the house allows us to dream in peace.""

It follows that if peace and protection is stripped away from the house, it presents something of an existential crisis to its occupants. (Darren Aronofsky's ""mother!,"" cloaked in grandiose allegory, had this simple idea at its heart.)

However it manifests, we all fear a loss of control over our perceived safe space. But perception is both subjective and objective. Some question whether homes can ever be safe spaces -- none more gleefully than ""the master of suspense"" himself, Alfred Hitchcock.

In 1965 Hitchcock famously quipped that ""one of television's greatest contributions is that it brought murder back into the home, where it belongs."" The director's aphorism rings true -- homes are, in many ways, brimming with violence.

""They're places rife with tension: psychological violence, emotional violence, and in some cases, literal violence,"" said Mark Jancovich, professor of film studies at the University of East Anglia. ""We imagine (violent threats are) external, we want to believe they're external, but actually they frequently bubble up from within.""

""We may be locking ourselves in with the very people we should fear most,"" he added, chillingly. Statistics bear this out. In the US between 2005-2010, strangers accounted for only 9% of violent crimes committed in the victim's home

In any case, we still want to believe our house is a safe space. Horror films set in homes actually might help us in this regard.

There's an argument that watching scary movies is cathartic: a consequence-free simulation of our worst anxieties and fears. The experience is stressful, but ultimately rewarding given that when the credits roll we can return to reality unscathed. Aristotle might suggest the catharsis helps us explore and understand our fears, and so when we think about our home, we can use this knowledge to assert a sense of control back over it.

Yun says she suffered nightmares while crafting ""Hereditary's"" domicile. In theory at least, they weren't for nothing.

Out of sight, not out of mind

It may take a while to convince audiences the film is a positive mental experience. Nevertheless, viewed through this lens the home becomes a switchboard, and there's plenty of ways Yun and Aster can plug into our fears.

The Graham family's 20th-century house is rural enough to evoke Gothic mansions but built with a modern sensibility. Its interiors, with wood-paneled walls and cast-iron bedframes, is a stately home on a suburban budget. Outside a treehouse perches in isolation, the cabin not quite in the woods.

""(Ari and I) didn't want it to look decrepit,"" said Yun in a phone interview, ""we wanted it to ride the line of believability."" At first glance the place is, but the devil's in the detail. Annie's deceased, ornery mother once lived in the house. Her influence has seeped into the timber, and echoes unsolicited down the maternal line.

Legendary director Dario Argento has argued that "" without psychology, the horror film doesn't exist ."" Grief is as much a source of horror as the paranormal in ""Hereditary,"" and both are reflected in the design. Annie's studio is filled with miniatures of her home life, real and imagined, life-like scenes as accurate as they are disturbing. ""As an artist (they're) her way to process traumatic events -- events that are unresolved for her,"" said Yun.

The domestic dioramas she makes spill out into the full-scale home. Yun researched dolls' houses and noticed the way each room had its own defined aesthetic -- color schemes, wallpaper patterns and symmetry. Reverse-engineering the house, she subtly made sure ""each room had its own unique aspect to it.""

It helps audiences navigate the space, Yun explained, but also offers a sense ""you're trapped inside Annie's artwork."" Freud's literal translation of the German "" unheimlich ,"" from which the uncanny derives, is ""unhomely."" Both are apt descriptions for the effect Yun creates.

Curiously, Yun admitted she's ""not well-versed"" in the horror genre. ""Ari thought my ignorance was somehow a benefit,"" she said, given he ""didn't want a photocopy"" of what was already out there. It's interesting -- and perhaps speaks to something unconscious -- that the way Aster uses the house, constructed to accommodate his 80-page shot list, evokes some genre staples.

Gary Oldman transforms into Winston Churchill

Over 100 years of scary movies have codified home interiors. We know from ""Psycho,"" ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" and recently ""Get Out,"" that entering basements is a fraught with danger. Attics are zones of perilous discovery for trespassers (""The Innocents""), and a space where occupants confront uncomfortable parts of themselves (""Jane Eyre"").

In life, so in horror cinema, ""you need a sealed off space,"" said Jancovich. We can't live among everything we own, he argued, and we choose what to put on show. Thinking of the house as a metaphor for the brain, there are peripheral spaces where we push possessions -- or memories or thoughts we don't want to confront but can't let go of -- out of sight and out of mind. Combined, these spaces can become a repository for our fears.

Through repetition of space and symbol, the genre does a lot to reinforce its own visual language. In ""Hereditary,"" as Annie hovers in front of her mother's bedroom door, we know without prompting that no good can lie behind it.

That's not to say Aster's film isn't original, or its home not subtle. For instance, the way Yun fleshes out the character of Annie's reticent daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro), with an outré studio of her own, is a twisted delight which invites close inspection and spawned its own Etsy page

""(Aster) loves films that, when you go and watch it again, you discover something new, you discover another layer,"" said Yun. Her production design is full of details and motifs that will only register on a second or third viewing. Annie's other miniature houses dotted around the home deserve scrutiny, for one. ""I don't want to give too much away,"" she said, ""but all that stuff was thought about, for sure.""

""This design was trying to be evocative,"" Yun reflected. ""I feel like I did birth something at the end,"" she added, ""it was cathartic in a way.""

Yun may feel purged, but audiences have all that to come. Her baby, that house, lies in wait, ready to welcome its next victims."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180614142721-20180614-hereditary-film-2-01-super-tease.jpg

Many of us are still captivated by the mythologies behind these dubious and sometimes dangerous sects, and the wealth of films, television shows and books on the subject is surely proof of our enduring fascination.

Recent years have seen the likes of HBO's ""Big Love"" and ""Going Clear,"" as well as Louis Theroux's ""My Scientology Documentary"" and the eerie ""Martha, Marcy, May, Marlene"" delve into the disturbing world of cults. Netflix's ""Wild Wild Country"" is the latest entry into the genre.

The six-part documentary series tells the bizarre story of how Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and his followers took up residence in rural Oregon, embarking on a campaign of bioterrorism against the enraged local community.

Aside from all the poisoning, politics and preaching, Rajneesh's followers were notable in the way they presented themselves in quasi-Buddhist red and orange robes, occasionally combined with a turtleneck and beads. In contrast to the wide collars and kipper ties of the native Oregonians, the ""orange people"" as they were sometimes referred to looked like from a different planet.

The Rajneeshan's sartorial efforts weren't fully appreciated at the time, but they've recently found many fans on the internet. Enthusiasts of the show cheerfully share images, and a number of fashion sites run pieces on how to get the Rajneeshan look. In fact, looking at pictures of the cult, you could be forgiven for believing you'd been given a preview of the latest Alessandro Michele collection for Gucci, with all the 70's glad rags and lustrous manes of hair.

Such a strong focus on visual identity isn't unusual in cults. Leaders are often keen to create a distinct image, combing through historical and religious iconography to draw people into their ranks.

How uniforms attract followers

History has long shown that if you want to get people to behave as you want, a uniform can go a long way. ""A uniform is usually a clean slate, a starting point,"" said Alex Esculapio, a writer and Ph.D. candidate with a focus on fashion and sociology. ""It shows you're not alone and you belong to a group of people. It becomes your new identity, and really signals a new start.""

Whether it's cults, terrorist groups or paramilitary organizations, violent fringe factions often like to create a recognizable visual identity. Right wing demagogues Oswald Mosley and Mussolini used drab colors, like black and brown, to create an image of militaristic strength, while Marxist groups seem to favor berets and fatigues. At protests around the world you can find the instantly recognizable hoodies of the anti-fascist Black Bloc group. Religious cults might be more spiritual than political, but they clearly understand the power of uniform.

""The thing that all cults, religions, or any social groups looking to distinguish themselves from mainstream culture have in common is a uniform that really sets them apart and makes all the members look alike. It creates a group identity, which is a signal to outsiders,"" said Esculapio.

""They're similar to an organized religion, who often have specific uniforms, such as Buddhist monks or Catholic priests, and there's also an overlap with the fashion mentality in general, the idea of style tribes. I think it's a dynamic that is present in all social life, but it becomes heightened in the case of cults.""

Perhaps the best-known example of this practice is the most violent and notorious cult of all, the so-called Manson family. In their early days at Spahn Ranch, Charles Manson cultivated a carefree, almost pastoral look for his family. The girls grew their hair long and uncombed, wore floral dresses and walked in bare feet. They could almost have been mistaken for a church group on an outing.

But after a series of brutal killings and a guilty verdict, Charles Manson shaved his head and his remaining supporters followed suit, creating a peculiar pseudo-Eastern look.

The flip side of the sartorial choices of cults

Manson was using aesthetic to both lure people in and to push them away. He created a pastoral, utopian, hippie version of his followers for when they needed to attract lost souls and runaways, and then turned them into a violent, freakish nightmare version for when they were put on a world stage.

Another infamous American cult who used uniform and stylistic language to create a feeling of purpose and vision was the suicide sect Heaven's Gate.

The group shot to worldwide attention in 1997 when 39 members, including group leader Marshall Applewhite, took a lethal dose of phenobarbital and vodka, before laying down to die in adjoining bunk beds. But the most striking element of the photos splashed across the media was that every member was wearing the same pair of Nike Decade trainers and black jogging bottoms.

As morbid as these images were, the pictures of the cult members' feet almost resembled a controversial fashion campaign, a feeling which was cemented when Saturday Night Live splashed Nike's famous '""Just Do It"" motto across the images and created a proto-meme straight from the realm of gallows humor.

Alex Esculapio, who has written about Heaven's Gate, believes that the trainers and uniforms were a way to create an identifiable and relatable aesthetic.

""They were different from a lot of what people might expect from a cult, because they were in touch with fashion. They were really keen on creating a visual identity and had been since the beginning. They had a few different incarnations, but they always used a specific style of clothing to emulate what they saw as aspirational. Nike shoes were particularly popular in the US in the 90's. They had specific grooming rituals, [for example] none of the men had a beard and they shaved their heads.

""Their neighbor at the time described them as looking like tech-nerds, so obviously they were in touch with what was happening at the time. There was a tension between isolation and hyper-awareness of modern culture, they knew they needed to stay in touch to survive,"" said Esculapio.

However, some of the most dangerous and violent cults of all didn't need to enforce identifiable dress codes on their followers. Reverend Jim Jones may have carefully cultivated his own preacher-in-sunglasses image, but his followers looked like they could have been pulled from any mall in America.

That lack of a distinct visual identity didn't stop more than 900 members from killing themselves in his name. The same goes for David Koresh's Branch Davidians, who visually resembled almost any other community in Texas, yet believed their leader to be the second coming and were willing to die for that."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180604173423-wild-wild-country-cult-uniforms-super-tease.jpg

Mércio Gomes is a Brazilian anthropologist living in Rio de Janeiro. The opinions in this article belong to the author.

A mixture of deep sorrow, anger and resentment has swept Brazilians across the country -- particularly in the city of Rio de Janeiro -- with the burning of their beloved Museu Nacional, or National Museum.

The fire started at about 7:30 Sunday evening, local time. It went on until the early hours of Monday, when firemen on their Magirus ladders sent enough water gushing out into what seemed to be a sacrificial bonfire to control the last of the flames.

By Monday morning, when I visited the site, the firemen were busy trying to enter the huge, early 19th-century neoclassical building to start gauging the extent of the destruction. For all we know, everything may have been burned to ashes.

Looking out over the building, its outer walls, though marked with ash, seem as tall and imposing as ever. But images from inside the museum show that the windows are all smashed, and the inner walls look practically carbonized. Thick volumes of charred wood, ash and debris -- from the collapsed roofs and burnt artifacts -- still smoldered on the floor, a horrifying testimony to the utter destruction of the museum.

Throughout the night, millions of Brazilians were glued to the news, mesmerized in horror and dismay as they watched the destruction of, perhaps, the most impressive colonial-era building Brazil has been able to maintain.

But then, as if searching for something less distressing to say, some of the museum's researchers and clerks roamed about in front of the building giving interviews to the press and revealing what they'd been able to save from the exhibition rooms and annexes before the fire moved in -- deep drawers filled with sheets of pressed flowers and leaves, a few small meteorites and, thank God, the library of one of the departments that was left unscathed. Oh yes, and no one -- not even the four security guards who witnessed the beginning of the fire -- has been reported injured.

This morning, I watched a crowd of students visit the museum, eager to enter as if to throw themselves into the ashes. After skirmishes with the police, the protesters stood outside the building shouting angry slogans and criticizing the federal government and the current administration. They demanded punitive action against those responsible for what they see as disgraceful political and administrative neglect.

Nobody yet knows the cause of the fire, but it is officials' irresponsibility, funding shortages in particular, which is being blamed for this tragedy.

Everyone has their preferred culprit in this national disgrace. With Brazil just weeks away from a general election, this mood of mutual accusation has, to use an ironic metaphor, flooded the nation like a tsunami.

It's not only politicians, the federal government, the Ministry of Culture or administrators at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (which the museum is tied to) -- virtually everyone is to blame. And everyone feels part of the larger cultural mechanism that has produced an attitude of carelessness and a basic incapability to keep an institution like the National Museum in a state of good repair.

We Brazilians have lost much of the material memory of our short past. A good part of our 518 years of history -- or that which had been transformed into storable objects and could be seen by all -- disappeared in just a few hours.

Perhaps we can, in a decade or so, reconstruct the museum and reconstitute part of its collections of scientific objects, memorabilia and curios to once again entertain the children who flocked to see them. It is, after all, the children of Rio de Janeiro and other cities around it who are the ones to suffer the most for this loss.

Huge fire engulfs museum in Brazil

The people of Rio de Janeiro were fond of taking their sons and daughters, grandchildren or a pack of nephews and nieces to the museum to show off their knowledge of odd-looking mummies brought in from Egypt by the Emperor Dom Pedro II, a huge skeleton of a humpback whale looking like a ribbed torpedo, or the brightly iridescent green and yellow feathers of a Kayapo headdress.

Never to be seen again are, perhaps, those old funeral urns unearthed from the island of Marajó at the mouth of the Amazon River, or the museum's collection of arachnids and insects stored in funny-shaped, smudged glass containers.

When I think that I can no longer take my youngest daughter or grandson to the Museu Nacional -- that is what gets me emotional. It is this sorrow that has penetrated our souls and may leave Brazilians feeling empty and forlorn for a long time to come."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180904091829-brazil-museum-aftermath-super-tease.jpg

Aric Chen is Lead Curator for Design and Architecture at M+ , the new museum of visual culture under construction in Hong Kong.

Upon first seeing digital renderings of architect Liu Jiakun's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing -- a row of 38 steel rods pulled taut by cables, like fishing poles bearing a formidable catch -- many were struck by its audacious simplicity.

As a first foray outside Britain for the Serpentine Gallery's hugely successful series of temporary pavilions (they have previously been built in London's Kensington Park and designed by heavyweight architects like Zaha Hadid, Sou Fujimoto and Bjarke Ingels) one might have anticipated a bit more flamboyance. Instead, Liu has given us something to think about.

We should have expected no less. The Chinese architect, now in his 60s, is rarely prone to showmanship, his stern demeanor only occasionally betrayed by a wry, playful streak. His previous work offers moments of sublime beauty: the play of water, concrete and light in his Luyeyuan Buddhist Sculpture Museum in Chengdu, the city which he's based, or the monumental, sun-dappled staircase of his Suzhou Imperial Kiln Museum

But mostly, Liu is known as an architect with the common touch. He unapologetically describes his work as ""low-tech,"" letting inexpensive materials and basic construction techniques speak for themselves.

""His projects engage with a local context, connecting Chinese public life and urban cultural space,"" said the Serpentine's artistic director, Hans Ulrich Obrist, in an e-mail.

Liu's buildings may be clever and impressive, but they are never pretentious. His style is often described as a form of architectural ""realism."" And as we near the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, his approach stands in stark contrast to an event that announced China's return as a global power.

Centered on the Bird's Nest stadium, that dazzling tangle of steel by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron and the now dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei (how times have changed), the Games served as a glaring reminder of architecture's power to represent and even shape a new epoch.

But as the Olympic fireworks lit up the Beijing sky, Liu was in Sichuan province where, just three months earlier, the magnitude-8.0 Wenchuan earthquake had devastated the countryside and killed almost 90,000 people . He and his studio aided recovery efforts by inventing a system that quickly turned rubble into usable bricks (Liu called them "" Rebirth Bricks "") while constructing an achingly humble memorial to a rural schoolgirl who had perished in the tragedy.

Shifting attitudes

A stone's throw from the Forbidden City, Liu's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing is almost perfectly aligned with the Bird's Nest along the capital's historically significant north-south axis. But the two structures are separated by more than just the decade between them -- they represent a shift in architectural priorities as well.

Even the most perfunctory glance at China's ever-expanding skylines offers enough evidence that the architecture of spectacle, with its kaleidoscopic contortions and gravity-defying acrobatics, is still in fashion. But beneath it all, the spotlight has pivoted towards approaches more rooted in Chinese culture.

Often small-scale and made using local materials, this is the architecture long practiced by Liu and the Pritzker Prize-winning Wang Shu , and increasingly by younger cohorts like Zhang Lei, Zhang Ke, and Xu Tiantian. Encouraged by everything from growing cultural self-assurance to government policies promoting rural development, their work is now emerging at the fore.

""He's the right architect at the right time,"" the Serpentine Gallery's CEO, Yana Peel, said of Liu in a phone interview.

According to Liu, his pavilion reflects the Confucian concept of ""junzi,"" a kind of morally cultivated self, as expressed in the metaphor of an archer's bow.

""I wanted it to give a sense of inner strength,"" he said by phone of the structure, which gently curves upwards at either end and is paved with the type of floor tiles once used in the Forbidden City. ""It's like an archer standing firm without firing a shot. It's pure force, but how you handle that force reflects your cultural attitude.""

Put another way, Liu's pavilion aims to reveal architecture at its most essential -- a visceral embodiment of potential energy held in elegant tension. But it's difficult not to also see, in the strain of its tightly-drawn posture, something more ominous about the growing controls over many aspects of Chinese life coming from the seat of power nearby (the Communist Party's headquarters stand adjacent to the Forbidden City).

Nonetheless, naming Liu as the designer of Beijing's inaugural Serpentine Pavilion was an inspired choice. Less than 20 years ago, Liu had become one of the very first architects to open a private practice in post-reform China, joining a field that was previously monopolized by state design institutes.

The country's architecture has had some catching up to do. But it says something about recent years that now we speak not only about how far it has to go, but of how far it has come."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180530105355-serpentine-pavillion-beijing-super-tease.jpg

It's 88 degrees Fahrenheit in Paris, and backstage at the unairconditioned Le Trianon theater is sizzling. Sweat-drenched assistants move around in a daze, giving garments a last-minute punch of steam from an industrial iron or adding the finishing touches -- an altered sleeve here, a few more crystals there -- to dresses that will cost tens of thousands of dollars. Teenage models clomp between fittings and makeup stations in preparation for what will be a very tense 15 minutes.

Amid it all, Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren, the Dutch designers behind Viktor & Rolf, move through the fray with unexpected calm, given the occasion. This season's haute couture show, just hours away, is the apex of a year of celebration as the designers mark their brand's 25th anniversary.

Horsting and Snoeren, one of fashion's most outrageous odd couples, have been champions of the avant garde from the beginning. Since meeting as 19-year-olds at the Arnhem Academy of Art and Design in the Netherlands, they've aspired to design clothes that are more curious than commercial, spawning countless conversations about the separation of art and fashion with collections that straddle both.

Their menswear, womenswear and haute couture have earned them industry praise and patronage from the likes of Bjork, Madonna, Lady Gaga and Tilda Swinton, with the latter inspiring and walking in the pair's Autumn-Winter 2003 ready-to-wear show.

After revisiting their archives for ""Viktor & Rolf: Fashion Artists 25 Years,"" an exhibition at the Kunsthal Rotterdam museum, and ""Viktor & Rolf: Cover to Cover,"" an upcoming coffee table book, the designers have mined the past again for the runway. This latest show has seen them recreate 25 of their most iconic pieces in white, embellishing them with more than half a million Swarovski crystals.

""We've always cherished the work we did in the past. That's just part of who we are,"" says Snoeren. ""We wanted it to not be nostalgic. We wanted it to be a light-hearted, fun, celebratory way of looking at the past.""

But for those who have followed the brand, it's hard not to get pangs of nostalgia looking through the garments hanging from metal rails around us. The final selection is a retrospective of the weird and wonderful: One gown appears to be sewn from a duvet and pillows (Autumn-Winter 2005), while another seems to have had a cannonball knocked through its tulle skirts (Spring-Summer 2010). A painted dress from Viktor & Rolf's aptly titled ""Wearable Art"" collection (Haute Couture Autumn-Winter 2015) transforms into a hangable canvas when taken off the wearer.

""We had to really show the codes of the work we've done,"" Snoeren says. ""And it's interesting to see how timeless, in a way, the pieces are and how they connect because you can't really tell when each piece was made. Somehow, they've become a new unit -- in our eyes at least.""

Such impractical concepts reflect the kind of creative independence that many designers dream of but few can afford. It is all made possible by Viktor & Rolf's business model, which uses profits from licensing and its wildly popular fragrance empire (which started with 2005's Flowerbomb) to fund more creative endeavors.

""I think at a certain moment, the success of our perfume business ... changed things for us,"" Horsting says. ""We realized how important it is to put creativity at the forefront, and it (also) gave us more freedom to do that.""

In 2008, Viktor & Rolf became a subsidiary of Only the Brave (the Renzo Rosso-owned company that backs Maison Margiela, Marni and Diesel) and in 2015, Horsting and Snoeren surprised many when they announced they were discontinuing their ready-to-wear lines.

At the time, Russo told Women's Wear Daily the decision was ""a strategic decision to position the Viktor & Rolf brand in the highest luxury segment of fashion."" But Horsting and Snoeren were also relieved to excuse themselves from a system they'd become disillusioned with, burdened by expectations around trendiness, wearability and commercial viability. They returned their focus to couture (they showed couture for two years from 1998, and returned to the schedule in 2013) and have recently branched out into bridal and occasionwear.

""We find it difficult to work in the (ready-to-wear) system -- the pace, the industrial system itself -- even if we worked with great partners. We just had a really hard time finding our groove there. I don't know how else to say it. We tried a lot of different ways, but I don't know. It wasn't us,"" Snoeren says.

At the rarefied world of Paris Couture Week, it's fantasies, not clothes, that are most in demand. Historically, this has been Viktor & Rolf's specialty. In Autumn-Winter 1999's ""Russian Doll"" couture show, for example, the designers showed an entire collection on one model, Maggie Rizer, personally dressing her in layer after layer on the runway. And in their Spring-Summer 2001 show, tap dancers in Louise Brooks-style wigs were drafted in to wear the clothes. (Horsting and Snoeren, wearing matching white suits, joined in on the final number.)

Horsting explains that runway concepts often come first, ""and then the clothes are almost actors in a play."" But today, they've decided to minimize the element of performance: ""We really wanted to focus on those moments, so we didn't want any distractions.""

Indeed, when the show finally begins (30 minutes behind schedule), the models walk through rows of chairs on black carpet, which is sprinkled with Swarovski crystals, with minimal fanfare. The clothes -- a Bowie-esque catsuit of mesh and glitter, a trench coat with the giant word ""NO"" protruding from the collar -- take the spotlight.

When the models line up on the stage for the finale in front of a twinkling curtain of gold lights, and dramatic music swells throughout the theater, it seems a fittingly spectacular climax."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180706150852-11-cnn-viktor-rolf-anniversary-super-tease.jpg

In a sleepy town in Tuscany, over 8,000 kilometers from Pyongyang, you can find one of the West's largest collections of North Korean art. The man behind the operation, Pier Luigi Cecioni, has been bringing North Korean artworks to Pontassieve -- a small commune just a stone's throw from Florence -- for over 10 years.

The pieces in his collection all come from the same Pyongyang art studio, Mansudae. With an estimated 4,000 employees, it is the largest state-run art house in North Korea -- and one of the largest art production centers in the world.

Cecioni formed his working relationship with Mansudae back in 2005, when, during an official tour of the country with an Italian orchestra, he asked to look at some North Korean art.

Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings.

""Once I was there, I said, 'I'm actually very interested in art -- do you have anything to show me?'"" Cecioni said in his studio. ""They brought me to Mansudae's studio. Nobody had ever heard of it (in) the West, so I asked them whether they would they be interested in doing some business in the West, and they said 'sure.'""

With over 1.2 million square feet of studio space, Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings made from semi-precious stones. Cecioni sells them all, with prices ranging from $300 to $7,000, depending on the size and detail of the work.

The best-sellers, he explained, have been hand-painted propaganda posters, which are the most affordable and have proven popular with art collectors.

Cecioni sells works from Mansudae for $300 to $7,000.

Cecioni said that dealing with the state-run art house has proven to be surprisingly easy. ""Doing business with North Korea is, in a way, very old fashioned,"" he said. ""They're very trustworthy. What they say, they do. And what you say, you have to do.""

How Cecioni imports the artworks -- some of which are over two meters wide -- is similarly straightforward: ""There is DHL in Pyongyang. So they are sent through DHL to us, and they arrive in five days,"" he said.

Sanctions taking effect

Beyond the world of art collectors, Mansudae is best known for large bronze statues, which can be found in African countries such as Namibia and Senegal.

The sale of these socialist-style statues has, however, come under scrutiny from the United Nations, which last year blacklisted the studio as part of tightening sanctions against Kim Jong Un's regime. It is believed that the monuments were being paid for in cash or land, helping North Korea evade existing sanctions and take in millions of dollars in income.

Cecioni imports artworks from Pyongyang using DHL.

""This money is highly significant,"" the coordinator of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, Hugh Griffiths, told CNN in December 2017. ""We are looking at at least 14 African (UN) member states where Mansudae alone was running quite large construction operations.""

Cecioni only deals in two-dimensional art, claiming that Mansudae's statue business is separate from the studio's main operation -- despite being run under the same name.

""It's like a big art company, there are many branches,"" he said. ""The money they received from us essentially goes back into running the studio. The very large statues -- that's Mansudae, but it's so different from the other things they do. It's definitely a multi-million-dollar enterprise, so I'm sure there is some direction from the (state).""

Cecioni said last year's UN sanctions has affected his business, as he's no longer able to import North Korean art.

Despite Cecioni's convictions that the art he buys plays no significant role in generating income for the regime, his business was still impacted by last year's UN sanctions.

""The sanctions that are on Mansudae specifically -- I think they were not well placed,"" he said. ""I don't think they had the right perception of what Mansudae really is. They aimed at the statues, and they also hit the things we do, which are irrelevant for the economy of the country.""

Cecioni's ability to acquire new works has come to a sudden halt. ""The sanctions on my business have had a tremendous effect, because we cannot import anymore,"" he said.

Best-sellers, according to Cecioni, have been hand-painted propaganda posters.

But while the Italian is not bringing in any new artworks, he still has over 300 pieces in storage. Demand from international customers hasn't slowed, he said.

But instead of selling from his existing stockpile, Cecioni has begun rejecting sales, saying that the art has always been difficult to accurately value, and that he wants to keep the works he has on hand until he can start importing again.

""We are not really trying to sell anymore,"" he said, ""because we cannot replenish our inventory."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180503145954-north-korea-art-2-super-tease.jpg

Norman Foster is a world-renowned English architect. He heads the international firm Foster and Partners and won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1999. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his.

Osvaldo Borsani was a true innovator. Born in 1911, the architect, designer and visionary left his mark at a crucial time in Italy's design history. From the 1930s he started working with other creative luminaries like Lucio Fontana, Roberto Crippa, Aligi Sassu, Fausto Melotti, and Arnaldo Pomodoro.

In 1943 he completed his own Villa Borsani in the town of Varedo, near Milan, still beautifully preserved as it has always remained with the family. Along with the extensive archives housed on its grounds, it offers a rare insight into his richly layered modernism. In 1953, along with his twin brother Fulgenzio, he founded his own manufacturing company, called Tecno -- a project for which he worked his whole life.

My introduction to the world of Tecno was in 1983 when Marco Fantoni, the son-in-law of its founder, Osvaldo Borsani, visited our London studio. At the time I was working on the Headquarter tower for HSBC in Hong Kong and Marco was offering the services of Tecno for the interior fitout.

Although the idea of a collaboration on the Hong Kong Bank was never realized, Marco later proposed a commission to develop a new range of furniture for Tecno. This was not the first such approach by a furniture manufacturer. Alias, also in ltaly, and Knoll in the United States, had made similar overtures but for a variety of reasons they did not feel right. Whether it was the chemistry of the personal relationships or my research into the company and its background -- whatever the reasons -- I felt confident enough to take Marco's idea forward.

Twin brothers

I eventually made a visit to Tecno's facility at Varedo, a fifteen-kilometer drive from the center of Milan. There I met the founder -- Osvaldo Borsani with his brother Fulgenzio. lt seemed to be the essence of a successful close-knit family enterprise that had prospered on a commitment to design and innovation.

Visiting this flagship on my trip it was difficult to believe that it had been realized almost thirty years earlier in 1955, shortly after the launch of Borsani's design classic, the P40 lounge chair.

Meeting the team within this building was to find an extraordinary cross-section of the Borsani family. One of the most challenging aspects of any design enterprise is how to balance the opposing forces of creativity and the commercial imperative. The Borsani bothers resolved this conflict by Osvaldo being the creative force and Fulgenzio taking care of the business side.

Their respective children, Valeria and Paolo, were very active in the company and with, Marco Fantoni and Robert Timosci formed the inner circle for our collaboration. This was the manner in which the so-called Nomos (from the Greek for 'law of custom') table and a related workplace systems of furniture was to evolve. In 1987, the design won the coveted Compasso d'Oro ADI Award.

Designing an exhibition

The public launch of the Norman Foster Foundation in Madrid in June 2017 was an opportunity to show the Foundation archive and the Fantoni family were surprised to find such a wealth of material on Nomos and its evolution -- apparently lacking in their own archive ABV based in the family's original Villa Borsani in Varedo. lt transpired that they were planning an exhibition that would chart the life and times of Osvaldo Borsani, the story of Tecno and its significant projects.

Given the importance of Nomos in any such narrative, it is perhaps hardly surprising that within the space of a few days the two Foundations had decided to collaborate on the exhibition with a request from Tommaso that the project team within the Norman Foster Foundation should lead on the design of the exhibition.

For me it has proved to be an opportunity to explore the life and times of a talented individual and the remarkable company that he created. Although the Nomos range is physically small, on the scale of the epic architectural projects which have engaged me over the years, it has a special personal significance, not just because it was my first involvement in product design for industry, but it was a manifesto for the importance of the furnishings within a building.

The central theme of a timeline is well established in the exhibition and will enable the visitor to walk through the different periods in the work of this not so well known but significant design pioneer and along the way to find insights into the wider process of design.

Dissolving barriers

Osvaldo Borsani spanned the custom design of a range of individual pieces which could change their shapes kinetically across to the systems thinking of large scale furniture installations for commerce.

Part of the mission of my Foundation is to encourage the links between architecture, design and the arts -- to demonstrate the importance of dissolving barriers -- especially between industry and design.

When I described the way in which the Nomos products had evolved under the large modular roof of the Varedo factory, I remember Borsani present at many of the key visits, as a figure in the background, elegantly dressed in tie, white shirt, cardigan and jacket. He did more than engage with us and approve the project. He was responsible for an environment in which it was possible to do what we did. He had created and cultivated an attitude of mind which encouraged craftsmanship and an attention to detail and quality. These were instilled across a relatively small workforce but they ran deep and had been nurtured over decades.

There are several parallel themes running through this exhibition but for me one of the most important is the nobility and pride in the human touch that lies behind the making of something well."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180416120820-villa-borsani-x9a4036-hdr-super-tease.jpg
a7e33a1fadc947b1bf803cb4452b4619	['David Hockney']	2018-02-07 08:43:02+00:00	David Hockney at 80: An encounter with the world's most popular artist	https://www.cnn.com/	US	David Hockney at 80: An encounter with the world's most popular artist	1	"David Hockney's home studio is set deep in the Hollywood Hills. We drive there from Sunset Boulevard, past sweeping views of the canyon below, 1920s Art Deco homes and modernist glass boxes perched at intervals on the hillside.

The ""English Angelino,"" as he sometimes refers to himself, lives in a corner house off the main road, just where the hill flattens out. A verdant, anonymous compound behind high gray fences, it's quiet, with no through traffic. With only a four-figure number on the door and a buzzer, there is no hint that this has, since 1979, been home to one of the world's most recognizable and popular artists.

We are buzzed in and directed up a short path to Hockney's studio, a building set aside from his home. From here, it is hard to make out his actual house, which is apparently a series of one- and two-story buildings -- bungalows almost -- enveloped in plants and shrubs. There are steps down, and somewhere tantalizingly out of sight is Hockney's famous swimming pool, a recurring subject in his paintings.

David Hockney at 80: A rare encounter with the artist

The studio -- a long, white, airy space with a staircase leading up to a gallery -- is a converted paddle tennis court. Upon entering, we see half a dozen or so works in progress. Hockney is preparing for a show at Pace Gallery in New York in April.

We hear him before we see him -- his hacking smoker's cough, to be precise. At 80 (and a half), Hockney is sitting in a favorite comfy armchair, reading the Financial Times. He peers up inquisitively through owlish glasses, before struggling up to greet us. He's wearing a blue and green striped cardigan (familiar to me from recent photos) and paint-spattered trousers, his once vibrantly dyed blonde hair now gray and thinning. He clutches a cigarette packet in one hand.

I'm little nervous at the beginning and don't want the interview to start before the cameras are ready to roll. We've arrived with three cameras to capture Hockney's every gesture, every laugh and every cigarette drag (he smokes three or four cigarettes during the interview).

“ I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years ... Every day I've done what I want to do. ” David Hockney

Making polite conversation, his assistant J.P. asks where I'm staying. I name a new boutique hotel on Sunset that he hasn't heard of. I complain about the lighting design in my room, which was so moodily dim that I couldn't find the bedside light switches. Evidently no one reads in bed these days -- the dominant fixture is a giant TV.

Hockney quickly interjects: ""Yes, they are just big voids,"" he says, referring to the TV screens. ""I don't like voids.""

Painting the pool

Hockney says that his swimming pool was also looking ""a bit like a void,"" so in the summer, the day before his 80th birthday, he had it drained so he could repaint the bottom himself with arcs of blue.

""Once it was painted, it made you see all the plants,"" he says. The job took him two and half hours, ""and that's how long it took me 20 years ago.""

Hockney's ex-lover, Gregory Evans, who lives next door and runs the business side of things for him, apparently questioned whether he was up to the job. ""Of course, I thought I could do it,"" he says a little defiantly.

He admits that he is stubborn, and you can sense a fierce willpower. He is not happy with the shade of blue -- it's ""a bit too pale"" -- and he may do it again. An hour or so later, after the interview is over, I politely ask if we can film his swimming pool. No, says Hockney -- ""Gregory wouldn't like it.""

A bigger retrospective

The pretext for our visit is Hockney's 80th birthday retrospective, which has already drawn well over a million visitors to London's Tate Britain, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

""I realize it is the last time (a retrospective) will be done in my lifetime,"" says Hockney. And that's the truth of it.

I ask him how this retrospective compares with the one in 1988 (around the time of his 50th birthday). ""Well,"" comes the blunt reply, ""it's 30 years later, 30 years more painting. A big difference, 30 years.""

We both laugh and I blush a little with embarrassment. It's arguably a stupid question, but there is also a feeling that Hockney wants his later work to receive the same attention that his paintings from the 1960s and 70s did.

“ I think in painting you can do things you can't do in photography. Edvard Munch said photography can't compete with painting because it can't deal with heaven or hell. ” David Hockney

Throughout the interview Hockney is his usual chatty, funny, contrary, bee-in-his-bonnet self. Naturally, he mentions smoking more than once -- ""Sixty-five years ago. I began smoking and they were called 'coffin nails' then.""

His father had been ""a big anti-smoker but (he died from) eating chocolate biscuits at 75. I'm five years older than him now,"" he says with a certain relish.

Fish and chips

Having first achieved success in his early 20s, Hockney has long been financially comfortable. But it seems that money never mattered that much to him, providing he has enough to run his studios.

He has always been generous by nature. I mention an early lithograph he gave away in 1954 -- the interior of a Yorkshire fish and chip shop with a 17-year-old art student, elbow on the counter, patiently waiting for his food to arrive.

""Yes I remember it. I remember drawing it on a lithographic stone they had at the art school in Bradford (in West Yorkshire).""

Hockney has astonishing recall. There were only ""about five copies,"" he says. I tell him that the copy that he gave to the shop's owners recently sold at auction for just under £19,000 ($27,000). Hockney shrugs; he's not remotely bothered. He's well aware that his work has risen hugely in value.

One of the first people to acquire Hockney's art was his friend and fellow student at London's Royal College of Art, the late R.B. Kitaj, in the early 1960s. Kitaj paid £5 ($7) for a drawing of a skeleton. ""That was quite a lot of money then,"" Hockney says, recalling being pleased that he was then able to buy cigarettes in packs of 20 rather than 10.

Hockney holds on to much of his own work, and has set up a foundation to look after it. I mention how much I admire his drawings of his mother, who died age 99 in 1999 (he painted her virtually every time he visited her). Hockney hints that he may exhibit them one day.

A gay pioneer

Hockney recalls the royal photographer, Cecil Beaton , purchasing one of his more sexually explicit paintings, ""Adhesiveness,"" for less than $60.

""I remember delivering it to his house,"" he tells me. ""He had it for 40 years."" The money helped pay for Hockney's first visit to New York in 1961.

We sometimes forget that, as a gay man in the public eye, Hockney was a pioneer of sorts -- an artist too honest not to paint his desires. Fresh out of college, he celebrated his sexuality through his work at a time when gay sex was still outlawed in England (it wasn't legalized until 1967). Those early pictures ""look rather good and stand up,"" he says.

'I feel 30 in the studio'

It's difficult to imagine Hockney not working. His work ethic is utterly engrained.

Hockney likes to paint in silence, ""to look, and look again."" Unlike Lucian Freud, for whom Hockney sat for a portrait for a total of 120 hours, he doesn't talk much to his sitters. Freud, he says, was ""amusing, gossipy and bitchy about other artists.""

Hockney laughs but doesn't elaborate. Both artists attended royal lunches as members of the Order of Merit, and he confides that Freud was always better at conversing with the Queen, as they had a common interest in horse racing.

Hanging by the studio staircase is Hockney's design for a six-meter (20 feet) high stained-glass window honoring the Queen, which is set to be unveiled in Westminster Abbey in October (we are quickly told that we can't film it). Suffice to say, it shows nature at her most glorious.

The image was drawn from memory on an iPad and features a favorite subject, hawthorn blossom. Hockney was obviously inspired by his prolonged stay in Yorkshire (2005-2013) where, year after year, he painted the seasons en plein air. A composite photo shows how it will appear once it's installed by the Abbey's transept. It looks splendid, enlivening an august religious space.

Every day, Hockney paints for six or seven hours. ""I'm perfectly happy doing this,"" he says. ""I feel 30 when I'm in the studio, so I come in every day and work, because then I feel 30.""

Hockney never seems to stop thinking about work. He takes iPad images of his current paintings to bed, so he can look at them and know ""what to do straight away"" the next morning. Painting is Hockney's be-all and end-all.

Our interview is regularly punctuated by his smoker's laugh, a guttural infectious chuckle. But he also seems older and more fragile, perhaps a tacit awareness of mortality. More than ever, he is reluctant to leave his studio -- his refuge, his cave.

He doesn't want to walk far or go to restaurants where he can't hear anything (he has got progressively deafer in recent years, and wears hearing aids in both ears). He is less and less keen on flying, disliking both long flights and travelling alone.

""Travelling, I feel 80,"" he says poignantly.

A bigger book

For almost the first time in his life, Hockney has begun looking back at his work in its entirety to reflect on his exhilarating artistic journey. Implicit in our conversation is the sense of an artist reflecting on his place in art history. And his undeniable conclusion is: ""Yes, I've made a few memorable pictures. I know that now.""

A crucial moment in this self-reflection has been the release of ""A Bigger Book,"" a 77-pound ""sumo"" book published in 2016. It is, he acknowledges, his autobiography.

""Well, I realized,"" says Hockney, flipping through the pages, ""that this would last 100 years. Most people will see my work in this book. So why not make it good?""

""A Bigger Splash"" (1967) by David Hockney Credit: Tate

His own copy -- which comes on a bespoke stand designed by Marc Newson -- is within easy reach, a few feet from his armchair. ""I keep looking through it,' he admits.

""I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years,"" he muses. ""Every day I've done what I want to do.""

""That's a privilege', I say. ""I know I'm privileged,"" comes the reply, ""I've always known that I was privileged.""

Hanging on the wall, just by the studio entrance, is a framed handwritten note. It was pressed into Hockney's hand by a stranger while he was visiting a museum. It reads: ""Thank you for brightening our world.""

""That was OK, wasn't it?"" he asks rather sweetly at the end of the interview. ""Yes,"" I exclaim, ""more than OK. Thank you!"" And it's true. Hockney has been in fine fettle -- funny and characteristically open, two of the many reasons why he has been so admired and loved for so long.

On camera, the years seemed to fall away. He sparkles and looks momentarily boyish. Before we wind our way back down the Hollywood Hills, he signs my Hockney book for me -- ""with love, David and a kiss"" -- and sees us out with a gentle handshake.

If you see a drawing of pre-Great Fire London, you see a jumbled low-rise city. An urban miasma of homes and inns punctured by an incredible amount of spires that point toward the sky.

It is an image of a city whose horizontal horizon contained the hustle and bustle of worldly life while its vertical dimension was dedicated to higher ideals.

So it was for the majority of the history of high-rise architecture. Towers were structures that performed special roles: symbolic, monumental, even mythological. They acted as symbols of power, of godliness, or in the case of the biblical story of Babel, overreaching ambition.

It was only at the beginning of the 20th century that the earthly world of human life began to occupy the sky. And it happened in Chicago, where a new phenomenon of towers emerged in the super flat landscape of the American Midwest. As the city's size and population exploded at the turn of that century the technologies of construction combined with supreme Chicagoan pragmatism to invent the modern typology of the skyscraper.

Chicago's 42-meter (138 feet) tall Home Insurance Building opened in 1885 and was the first tall building to use structural steel in its frame. Others followed fast, and the Chicago School, as it came to be known, developed a new typology that combined modernity with decoration and ornament.

In these buildings you can see old architectural ideas of what buildings should be being stretched and pulled into new shape by modern possibilities. Other examples included the Monadnock Building (the largest commercial build in the world at the time of its construction in 1892), the Reliance Building (famed for developing large plate glass windows), and the Marquette Building (with its intricately patterned terracotta exterior). Each of these helped develop the skyscraper typology.

Enabled by technology, these new commercial American buildings were also a function of economics. Building high meant developers could multiply plots of land vertically, stacking floor upon floor to multiply value again and again. It meant that the kinds of speculation familiar to the stock exchanges of Chicago and New York could be applied to the act of building.

In Europe, architects eyed the possibilities of high-rise differently. Instead of commercial value, early modernists saw how a different kind of social value could be created. Advances in technology, they hoped, could be harnessed to create a more equitable social good.

Emerging as part of post-war reconstruction, towers became an important part of the provision of public housing. Symbolically, these towers of the welfare state offered something new, something modern with light and air that represented an escape from the grimy industrial city of the past, liberation from the old order.

Looking out over the London skyline now, we see both of these kind of towers: high-rises built as homes for the people, and shiny, thrusting vertical edifices of the financial heart of the city -- the Gherkin, Cheesegrater, Walkie Talkie et al. We see the new luxury developments, super high-rises built as high-end homes -- or more often investment opportunities. Just as old London's skyline reflected the aspirations and ideas of its age, we see silhouettes that reflect ours.

And amongst them, the charred shell of the Grenfell Tower, after a tragic fire in 2017 killed at least 71. It stands as a totem signifying the battle over the right to the city that has characterized recent years. As social housing has been increasingly privatized and funding squeezed, we have seen the boom in other kinds of high-rises for business and for the wealthy. It has led to a schizophrenic state where there are calls to demolish all of the tall post-war housing stock while at the same time accelerating high-end luxury living.

Outside of the big 'P' politics of the situation, towers still seem to contain those very same ancient Babylonian dreams and fears. Highness brings with it a separation from the city below. For some, towers mean power and success or a kind of quiet beauty, while others see alienation from the street and arrogant elevation above. Somehow the pragmatism of vertically stacking still carries echoes of those early significances, as if contemporary buildings can't shake old superstitions. On the one hand places full of the light of aspiration, on the other hubris and the moral peril as if defying the laws of gravity is somehow an overreaching of the normal social or economic order too.

It's strange that the tower, such a new phenomenon relatively speaking, has so quickly become typecast -- as if we've exhausted our imagination of the possibilities of vertical life. Perhaps it's appropriate that -- back in its birthplace -- the tower as a speculative possibility was the centerpiece of this year's Chicago Architecture Biennial . In an exhibit titled ""The Vertical City,"" artistic directors Sharon Johnston and Mark Lee invited over 15 emerging architecture practices to reinterpret the tower as a building type through giant-sized five meter tall models.

Tatiana Bilbao's ""(Not) Another Tower"" suggested how the technology of vertical buildings might become a framework to allowing for a more ad-hoc community to become a kind of civic collage in the sky. Office KGDVS proposed a kind-of ultimate vertical multiplication project where their 'ideal' building type of the palazzo was placed one on top of another, each layer larger than the last so that it formed an inverted spire. Serie Architects reimagined the possibilities of the structural frame to built a tower of nested tables to create bigger and smaller floor plates, one sometimes within the other. Kéré Architecture's big blue tubes punctured with holes suggested a more optimistic idea of the Tower of Babel, where all kinds of life; living, working and leisure could all be part of the same structure.

My own firm -- Sam Jacob Studio -- imagined how a high-rise building might be formed out of stacking sections of very different kinds of buildings one onto of another so that rather than repeating the floor plate, a whole host of different types of spaces and uses might be possible.

In other words, these propositions showed that there are many ways to reimagine the tower beyond its current state. To reinvigorate the possibilities of vertical building with the same energy that was the source of its original invention -- as both an economic and social possibility.

After the Great Fire of London in 1666, the city was rebuilt. As part of the new city, 51 new churches were built, including a series of churches by Christopher Wren's assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor, each with strange and striking towers. Among them, Christchurch Spitalfields with its obelisk on top of a triumphal arch, St Anne's Limehouse, which seems crowned by series of turrets supported by a mass of intersecting columns, and St Georges Bloomsbury with a ziggurat placed above a temple.

If we need to look anywhere for inspiration for the next generation of towers (and surely, we do, looking at what's being erected around the world right now) then there would be nowhere better to look.

These spires must have seemed unfeasibly tall and shockingly modern in their day. Yet they're rich and intriguing contributions to the city, explorations of our collective aspirations and fears, full of diversity and imagination that suggest new ways that me might live together. Could we not imagine towers today that could take on the same kind of role?"	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140218103154-shanghai-world-financial-centre-story-top.jpg
acaf91bd445b4c6091450ce80622779e	['Michael Govan']	2018-03-28 05:31:21+00:00	Is art for pleasure or politics?	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Is art for pleasure or politics?	1	"Written by Michael Govan

Michael Govan is the director and CEO of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). On March 28, he chairs an Intelligence Squared discussion with four contemporary artists on the topic: Is art for pleasure or politics? The opinions in this article belong to the author.

Henri Matisse famously declared that he dreamed of an art ""devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter ... a soothing, calming influence on the mind, rather like a good armchair."" His close friend Picasso, who more often indulged the darker sides of human emotion, wasn't especially political in his art either.

Nonetheless, in the mid-1930s, during an urgent rush of creativity, the latter painted a dramatic mural-sized protest over the bombing of Guernica in the direct black and white tones of a newspaper. The political directness of his ""Guernica"" (pictured above) may have been inspired by the revolutionary attitude of his Mexican friend Diego Rivera, or the politically charged paintings of his historical compatriot Francisco Goya's famous series, ""Disasters of War.""

The painting is an obvious example of how aesthetics and protest are not mutually exclusive. Picasso showed that painter and painting could be both.

The art world has always debated where it falls on the spectrum between pleasure and politics. Do we really want art to challenge us with the conflicts and threats we find in the news every day?

If it does so, contemporary political art risks preaching to an audience comprised of a small, well-educated liberal elite that is already aligned with its message. Arguably, this art will then become complicit in feeding on the same market and power structures whose hands it bites.

Is it unfortunate that a few high-profile transgressive images can spoil a government's appetite for art that might be described as simply beautiful, inspiring or educational? Maybe. Or maybe not. Are Ai Weiwei's artistic provocations a threat -- or more like a Socratic gadfly nibbling at the state to rouse it into becoming its better self?

The responsibilities of art

At LACMA (the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where I serve as director), you'll find plenty of examples of contemporary artists addressing our political era's most pressing issues: Alejándro Iñárritu's new and beautiful VR installation that engenders empathy for the plight of immigrants; a huge and seductive painting by Mark Bradford that calls out the injustices perpetrated by U.S. police against African-American men; or a spectacular mural by Barbara Kruger that, if not strictly protest art, is certainly pointed in its cry for greater awareness of what a capitalist consumer culture portends.

Having said this, many of us gravitate toward art, or art museums, not for politics or protest, but for the type of comfort Matisse sought. We may even use art to find solace in an unstable and sometimes threatening world. The people waiting in lines outside every museum that has hosted Yayoi Kusama's recent traveling retrospective were seeking (beyond Instagram moments) pleasure and wonder in trippy, brightly-colored, literally glowing, immersive environments. And why not?

Consider also, however, that the pursuit of pure beauty can be more political than we think. Artists are always citizens of somewhere. They are also human, and thus carry the same responsibility that most of our politics, religions and philosophies suggest: that we should improve, not diminish, our lives and the world we inhabit.

The principles of aesthetics aren't at odds with social and political responsibility. To use another example from LACMA, Chris Burden's bright and iconic ""Urban Light"" sculpture at the museum's entrance may have inspired more playful pictures on social media than any other major artwork in the world, but it has its own politics. The artist himself saw his composition of 202 historical street lamps, made a decade ago, as a statement about what constitutes a sophisticated society: ""safe after dark and beautiful to behold,"" as he put it.

An ongoing debate

The art world is far from consensus on the relationship between art and politics. Indeed, the lineup of artists discussing this very topic at an Intelligence Squared event in Hong Kong this week exemplifies the diversity of opinions on how -- or even whether -- the two should interact.

Boundary-defying 33-year-old Chinese artist Lu Yang mixes media and the Internet into a bold soup of topical issues, poking at social mores while declaring that her work has nothing to do with politics. Irish artist John Gerard's computer simulation of a flag made from black smoke in an abandoned oil field (popular with museums and on YouTube) seems to capture the zeitgeist of our concerns around politics and the environment.

Similarly, Icelandic-Danish artist Olafur Eliasson has, in addition to numerous installations addressing climate change, founded a project that produces and markets inexpensive solar-powered lights for the developing world -- encouraging awareness and taking action at the same time.

And Iranian artist Shirazeh Houshiary makes work that is subtle in its politics. In more than one of her artworks she has combined the human breath, through voice -- of Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, and Sufism -- poetically insisting that we are one humanity and spiritual whole.

Great art has, through time, been made in many guises. It has been made as protest and as propaganda, made to disturb and to sooth, made to question and to express. Our increasingly globalized media-driven world brings us closer to many people's struggles; it also brings us stories, and beauty, from everywhere."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180328093432-picasso-guernica-super-tease.jpg

Culture is a powerful tool. It's how we change the world. And for eight years, we had a presidential administration that knew this acutely.

As they demonstrated time and time again, Barack and Michelle Obama were adept at using culture to communicate with the public in meaningful ways.

Together, they kept artists and musicians in close company and hosted forums with leading cultural figures.

They also filled their home with artworks by the likes of Alma Thomas, Glenn Ligon and William H. Johnson, signifying not only good taste but a commitment to building a more representative White House.

The Obamas knew how to deploy culture. And in those moments, we witnessed an administration unafraid to challenge tradition while simultaneously respecting the sanctity of government and its offices. The former first couple seemed to use every opportunity at their disposal to push contemporary life and culture forward.

Today's unveiling of their official portraits at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery is no exception.

Painted by Brooklyn-based Kehinde Wiley and Baltimore-based Amy Sherald, these portraits will have a huge impact on American society. They mark a momentous shift in our cultural landscape -- one that should never have taken this long, but is certainly worth the wait.

To start, the paintings are the first presidential portraits by African-American artists to enter the gallery. This iconic wing of the Smithsonian now has a black genius in its midst, and, much like the administration itself, the presence of these artists in an institutional space is not to be understated.

Moreover, both Wiley and Sherald are contemporary American painters with a gift for honoring the tradition of their craft while pushing its boundaries in true style.

Much like the Obamas, they show a propensity for balancing the expected with the edgy, offering a refreshing -- and much needed -- shift in the traditions of presidential portraiture. Today marks yet another instance where the art world has chosen to move with society rather than allowing it to stagnate.

I believe that we will feel the cultural effects of the Obamas' time in the White House for generations to come. These portraits mark yet another pivotal moment in both their legacy and American history. In many ways, today's unveiling makes me feel hopeful that we can live in a country that is truly representative of the diversity of its people.

It also makes me feel hopeful that we can realize a nation that believes in affording opportunities to those who deserve them.

And as such, I am reminded of the words of abstract expressionist painter Gerhard Richter: ""Art is the highest form of hope."" Over the years, I have returned to these words to remind me that change is only possible when there is hope, and that art's capacity to deploy said hope is boundless.

I agree with Richter, and I find his sentiment particularly apt in the context of an administration that ran a campaign on hope -- and won.

Artist reimagines classic paintings with modern twist

It has always been the job of art to record the times. We make art to tell our stories and reinforce our histories. But we also, often, make art to present the world as it should be, not always as it is. There is no limit to the power of an artwork that can posit ideas for a better and more just society. Again, it's how we change the world.

Culturally, socially and politically, we are in a moment of deep expansion as a country.

These developments come with their own growing pains -- ones that seem to test us every day. But nonetheless, it is moments like the commissioning of these portraits that remind me that we can, have and will push forward.

It's a time to be hopeful for the future and to recommit to building a cultural identity that is truly representative of our nation's people and promise."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180212161207-barack-michelle-obama-portraits-super-tease.jpg
894a1ee1cb1a4791891bb97ac1b26b70	['Siri Hustvedt']	2018-02-14 13:01:16+00:00	We need to talk about erotic art	https://www.cnn.com/	US	We need to talk about erotic art	1	"Written by Siri Hustvedt

Siri Hustvedt is the author of a book of poetry, four collections of essays, a work of non-fiction, and six novels, including the international bestsellers ""What I Loved"" and ""The Summer Without Men."" Her most recent novel, ""The Blazing World,"" was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize and won The Los Angeles Book Prize for fiction. The opinions in this article belong to the author.

Twenty-nine years ago, a group of anonymous feminist artists known as the Guerrilla Girls unveiled a poster that read, ""Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum? Less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art Sections are women, but 85% of the nudes are female.""

This week, Sotheby's is auctioning 89 works under the title ""Erotic: Passion & Desire."" Fifty-five of the artists are men. Three are women: Marlene Dumas, Tracey Emin and Lisa Yuskavage. As I scrolled through the hodgepodge of offerings, however, I noticed one female nude after the other in traditionally passive, receptive poses, many of which are no different from countless nudes that hang on the walls of museums all over the world but are not identified as erotic art.

The venerable auction house explains: ""Whether it is to compel, to shock or seduce, these artworks remain one of the central subjects of art history while intimately charting the socio-political developments of our many cultures -- both old and new.""

I am fascinated by this reference to ""socio-political developments."" At this particular socio-political moment, a moment of both #MeToo and the exposure of flagrant misogyny, Sotheby's auctions erotic art mostly made by white men. Although this certainly tells us about the socio-political realities of the art world and its ongoing marginalization of female artists and artists of color, what ""developments"" are being intimately charted?

""Young Lady Laying on a Bed"" (1771) by Hugues Taraval Credit: Courtesy Sotheby's

Arguably, lot 74, a copy of the first issue of Playboy, offers us a peek into 1950s white America, just as lot 56, the seated Colima figure with a huge penis, tells us something about fertility ceremonies in pre-Columbian West Mexico.

""Pre-Columbian sculpture will be paired with Picasso works on paper; masters of photography from Man Ray to Mapplethorpe will be set off against 19th-century marbles and antique reliefs; in turn creating juxtapositions that will enliven and deepen collectors' understanding of the subject matter,"" Sotheby's writes. Notice the evasive language. The word ""sex"" is not mentioned.

In an age when every 12-year-old has access to pornography online, when every possible sexual taste is there to be ogled, Sotheby's wants to stress that it is not selling pictures as aids to masturbation. This is erotic art. The difference is crucial. Porn is a low, crude, cheap, bodily business, not about to ""deepen collectors' understanding."" Art, on the other hand, even when it depicts unbridled orgiastic activities, is high, intellectual, cultured, and expensive. As such, it can be related to refined mental activity or ""understanding.""

Whether buying a French 18th-century canvas by Hugues Taraval with the title, ""Young Lady Laying on a Bed""; a Mel Ramos naked babe mounting a cigar; or a wild George Grosz drawing of two excited women and a man with a penis proportionally as big as the Colima figure's, potential collectors can feel reassured that however titillating the ""subject matter,"" the work comes stamped with Sotheby's seal of approval as high art.

The boundary between erotic art and pornography has always been troubled, but ever since the Greeks, the mind, culture, and thinking itself have been identified as masculine in the West, while the body, nature, and emotion have been identified as feminine. This hierarchy is still in place. As Lynda Nead points out in her book ""The Female Nude: Art, Obscenity and Sexuality"" : ""The representation of the female body within the forms and frames of high art is a metaphor for the value and significance of art generally. It symbolizes the transformation of the base matter of nature into the elevated forms of culture and the spirit.""

This creative transformation is the business of the male artist. As a culture, we are still struggling with what it means to be artist and woman. After all, we masculinize and feminize human activities all the time. The hard sciences are masculine and cerebral; the arts are soft and feminine. And because the arts are broadly coded as feminine, and erotic art in particular evokes the lower sensations and emotions, it becomes all the more important to give it a high, mental, masculine stamp. Although they are homoerotic, Robert Mapplethorpe's static, classical photographs of cropped male, often black, bodies fit nicely into the idea that art is the metamorphosis of brute nature into ideal, perfect forms. The naked becomes the nude.

It is no secret that buying art is a matter of prestige. The act of acquiring a canvas or sculpture or photograph and paying good money for it means that you admire what you have purchased, that having the name Picasso in your house is a form of self-enhancement. Ownership signifies that the owner looks up to the talent, the brilliance, the authority of the artist.

Most heterosexual men, either consciously or unconsciously, are still deeply uncomfortable with the idea of looking up to a work that has a woman's name on it. To be succinct: the male collector who buys works by women risks feeling emasculated. This is true, despite the fact that distinguishing a woman's artwork from a man's (including the offerings by women in this auction) is often impossible.

The Sotheby's sale is taking place at the same time as a Carolee Schneemann retrospective at New York's MoMA PS1. Schneemann, who is 78, has been making confrontational, sexual, feminist art since the 1960s. She often used her own body as the vehicle of representation in performance and film.

""The female nude is part of a revered tradition, although she is not to take authority over depictions of her nudity,"" she told the Guardian in 2014. ""She is just to be available.""

Schneemann, along with many others, has taken that authority. This act is most definitely ""a socio-political development."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180214125751-sothebys-erotic-art-tease-super-tease.jpg
a82b1c16917c497aa9c6d91913be0a69	['Joanna Bourke']	2018-04-02 13:55:12+00:00	How artists interpret war	https://www.cnn.com/	US	How artists interpret war	1	"Written by Joanna Bourke

Joanna Bourke is a professor of history at Birkbeck, University of London, and the editor of ""War and Art: A Visual History of Modern Conflict."" The following is an edited excerpt taken from her introduction. Opinions in this piece belong to the author.

War is the most destructive activity known to humanity. Its purpose is to use violence to compel opponents to submit and surrender.In order to understand it, artists have, throughout history, blended colors, textures and patterns to depict wartime ideologies, practices, values and symbols. Their work investigates not only artistic responses to war, but the meaning of violence itself.

Frontline participants in war have even carved art from the flotsam of battle -- bullets, shell casings and bones -- often producing unsettling accounts of the calamity that had overwhelmed them. Tools of cruelty have been turned into testaments of compassion and civilians have created art out of rubble.

Art, according to Izeta Gradevic, director of Sarajevo-based Obala Art Centre, can be more effective than news reportage in drawing international attention to the plight of ordinary people at war.

""When you face an art form,"" she told journalist Julie Lasky, ""it is not easy to escape death.""

Art in difficult times

The declaration of war typically triggers practical difficulties for artists. At the very least, the sense of crisis risks relegating the arts to a minor role in society.

As Charles C. Ingram, acting president of New York's National Academy of Design, complained in 1861, the ""Great Rebellion"" (American Civil War) had ""startled society from its propriety, and war and politics now occupy every mind."" He lamented that ""no one thinks of the arts"" and even artists had set aside ""the palette and pencil, to shoulder the musket.""

The state appropriation of space sees exhibition possibilities plummeting. Economic sanctions severely limit the availability of supplies. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, for example, Japanese artists faced restrictions not only of paint, but of materials such as silk, gold and mineral pigments that had been used to create ""nihonga,"" traditional Japanese-style paintings.

But everything from excitable patriotism to down-to-earth curiosity has led millions of artists into the heart of darkness. Some were official appointees, sent by their governments to create a record of what was happening or to offer visual slogans to aid morale. Voluntarily engaging in active war service could allow artists to circumvent some of the restrictions created in wartime. In fact, governments often proved willing to support artists who threw themselves into the war effort.

As the New York literary journal The Knickerbocker extolled at the start of the American Civil War, ""ARTISTS! ... remember that your elegant brushes are recording the history of a nation.""

This required artists to serve the interests of the collective, however. Many struggled to resolve the tension between artistic freedom and censorship. Was their art supposed to bolster recruitment or demonize the enemy? Were they expected to be ""official war artists"" (as British artists were called during the First World War) or ""official recorders"" (as they were renamed during the first Gulf War)?

Even the most message-orientated artist might find that they had little control over the way their images were used. They returned from the front lines to discover that their sketches had been altered or even brazenly distorted by publishers and propagandists.

Art as propaganda

Was it the job of artists to reconcile people to war? German artist Otto Dix thought not. His painting ""Trench"" is a searing indictment of the inhumanity of war, but critics were appalled. In the Kölnische Zeitung, a popular daily newspaper in Cologne, critic Walter Schmits complained that ""Trench"" weakened ""the necessary inner war-readiness of the people"" and offered people ""no moral or artistic gain."" Museums are ""for art ... not propaganda,"" he insisted.

But many artists embraced their role as propagandists. Miyamoto Saburo's "" Meeting of Generals Yamashita and Percival "" is a powerful example. The painting shows negotiations between Japanese and British generals during the surrender in Singapore, one of the most humiliating defeats in the history of the British army. In contrast to the forceful presence of General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the commander of the forces of the British Commonwealth (Lieutenant General Arthur Percival) is portrayed as cowardly and arrogant.

The painting won Japan's Imperial Art Academy Prize in 1943 but, more importantly, it was hoped that it would bolster morale at a difficult point in the war. The tradition of sensoga (or Japanese war painting) was awkward for those who sought to depict the horrors of conflict. Artists became embroiled in controversy when they exhibited more brutal representations.

In 1943, for example, Tsuguharu Fujita exhibited ""Desperate Struggle of a Unit in New Guinea,"" which depicts a fierce battle scene based on the defeat of Captain Yasuda's troops in 1942. Drawn in muddy browns, there are no clear distinctions between combatants on either side. War hurts. Everyone.

Although military commentators praised the realism of the work, even using it to encourage kamikaze pilots, others were disparaging. Ishii Hakutei, one of the founders of the sosaku hanga (""creative prints"") movement, doubted that the painting would be ""useful . . . in drumming up war spirit."" There was ""a danger that the viewer will sense evil before admiring the loyalty and bravery of the imperial troops.""

The realities of war

Attempting to capture and convey the visceral horrors of the vulnerable body at war has taken many different forms. It has also been the focus of a very different genre of war art: medical illustration.

Sketches and photography made during conflict have been employed in diagnosing pathologies, aiding surgical practices and assessing the progress of a disease and its treatment. But there is also an artistic tradition in war medicine that emphasizes its artistic merits as much as its medical usefulness.

Its pioneer was Charles Bell, a surgeon, neurologist, anatomist and artist, who in 1815 offered his surgical services to the men who had been wounded during the Battle of Waterloo. One of Bell's watercolors, for instance, shows a soldier whose arm had been torn off by an exploding shell. His sketches and paintings were intended to illustrate wounds and operative techniques in order to educate other surgeons.

His emphasis on gestures was intended not only to reveal physical suffering, but to excite sympathy in observers. In his words, while the public were viewing the battle at Waterloo in terms of ""enterprise and valor,"" in his sketches he sought to remind people of ""the most shocking sights of woe""

For Bell, visual representations of agony were crucial if the public was to both understand the realities of war and sympathize with its victims. It took great courage, as well as grit, for artists like Bell to look closely at the wounds of war and use their artistic portraits to reflect on violence and corporeality.

Changing attitudes

The theme and mood of war art has undergone major shifts over the past two centuries. Prior to the twentieth century, war artists were more likely to depict heroic tales rich in religious imagery, such as the ""Massacre of the Innocents"" and the ""Passion of Christ."" Nineteenth-century British painting reveled in depicting decisive military maneuvers taking place in sumptuous battlefield landscapes.

In France, artists such as Nicolas-Toussaint Charlet, Jacques-Louis David, Auguste Raffet and Antoine-Jean Gros were inspired by the deeds of Bonaparte and his army. Perhaps the most powerful of these is Gros' ""Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau,"" exhibited at the Salon in 1808. It shows Napoleon visiting the corpse-strewn battlefield in Eylau (eastern Prussia) the day after the bloody French victory over the Prussians.

Tens of thousands of men from both sides had been killed. While Marshal Joachim Murat is portrayed as a callous warrior, Napoleon is depicted as a compassionate, even Christ-like figure, blessing the men on the battlefield.

Even at this stage, though, opposition to the heroic tradition was growing. As the Crimean War dragged on and reports of strategic mistakes proliferated, artists began expressing a general sense of disgruntlement. They began shifting their sympathy away from portraits of great generals.

As with Lady Butler's art, the true heroes were increasingly the ordinary soldier and his family. Joseph Noel Paton's "" Home "" (1856) was an important turning point. Its sentimental depiction of a wounded corporal in the Scots Fusilier Guards returning to his wife and mother proved comforting to a population ravaged by war and anxious about its aftermath.

Paton did not rest content with reassuring representations of the war, however. His "" The Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Crimea, and staff, "" painted a year before ""Home,"" was damning. It depicted British officer FitzRoy Somerset as Death riding a skeletal horse over the corpses of his own men. Famine, Disease and Death stalk the land.

Admittedly, Paton did not exhibit this sketch at the time. It was first exhibited in 1871, by which time artistic dissent was more established. War artists were turning sour.

Artistic bitterness escalated during World War I. The bloodbath at the Battle of Passchendaele was decisive for young artists such as Paul Nash. In an angry letter to his wife Margaret, he explained that the war was ""unspeakable, godless, hopeless."" Its horrors were so great that he no longer considered himself to be ""an artist interested and curious,"" but was instead a ""messenger who will bring back word from the men who are fighting to those who want the war to go on forever.""

Such artist-messengers, like their counterparts in literature, developed a narrative -- what the literary scholar Samuel Hynes called the great ""myth of war"" -- that began with ""innocent young men, their heads full of high abstractions like Honor, Glory and England"" and ended with disillusionment.

From World War II henceforth, a new, acrid kind of art was required. Representing the ""authentic"" combat experience entailed assaulting the senses of sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch. It required artists to visually represent the sound of grenades detonating, the stench of high explosives, the metallic taste of blood, and the sight of human bone, muscle, tissue, skin, hair and fat strewn around.

To paraphrase the essayist Elaine Scarry, ""to see pain in war art is to have certainty -- to see heroics is to have doubt.""

Intrinsically political

Arno Breker, often referred to as ""Hitler's favorite sculptor,"" once declared that art ""has nothing to do with politics ... for good art is above politics."" He was wrong. Art is intrinsically political. It is often explicitly so, most obviously for artists who use their creative talents to protest against warmongering.

It is often explicitly so, most obviously for artists who use their creative talents to protest against warmongering. Even artists who explicitly seek to change the way people understand armed conflict can find that their art actually obfuscates atrocity. Art can turn violence into a tempting melodrama or consumable drama; ""war as hell"" is beguiling.

But even when not explicitly depicting the human body in its abject or mortal states, war art involves the cultural contemplation of violence. The victors and the defeated, the landscapes in which they moved, and imagined pasts, presents and futures are refracted through the creative energies of artists. The dead also live on in the hand of the artist and the eye of the witness.

Loss is there for all to see. Audiences as well as artists celebrate an aesthetic of responsibility; looking closely rather than looking away."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180228144440-war-and-art-homepage-tease-super-tease.jpg
e6a3e052fed0412d98b612ea8f44f09a	['Marlen Komar']	2018-06-15 10:35:06+00:00	Frida Kahlo: the Mexican artist who used fashion to make a powerful political statement	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Frida Kahlo: the Mexican artist who used fashion to make a powerful political statement	1	"Written by Marlen Komar, CNN

Frida Kahlo's heavy unibrow and technicolor clothes are as recognizable as her art: her image has been replicated on postcards and museum magnets, Barbie dolls and Snapchat filters jewelry and runway collections . But, like her surreal portraits, Kahlo's appearance was layered, heavy with meaning and intention.

A proud ""mestiza"" -- a mixed-race woman, born to a German-Hungarian father and a half Spanish, half indigenous Tehuana mother -- Kahlo purposely mixed Western fashions with traditional garb, using her clothes to craft another kind of self-portrait. Through her dress, she constructed an ethnic and political identity that spoke of the same duality found in her paintings, and sent a highly political statement of cultural identity, nationalism, and feminism.

""(Frida Kahlo) created her distinctive style as a blend of traditional Mexican and European fashion, combined with the fundamental effects of her disabilities and her political beliefs: Kahlo as a bohemian artist, a Tehuana, a hybrid persona,"" said Circe Henestrosa, co-curator of ""Frida: Making Her Self Up,"" a new exhibition at London's Victoria and Albert Museum.

And yet since Kahlo's death in 1954, this element of her dress has been lost, whitewashed by corporate and creativity entities looking to make her more accessible. It's this sanitization that Henestrosa and Claire Wilcox, her co-curator, are aiming to fight back against. With a display of 200 personal artifacts and items of clothing belonging to Kahlo -- silk skirts with floral embroidery, Revlon eyebrow pencils, Guatemalan coats, cotton huipils (loose tunics) -- they explore how Kahlo used her dress as both adornment and metaphor and brought Mexican identity politics to the world stage.

""('Frida: Making Her Self Up') is recapturing this lost message, a person and her beliefs, visually expressed through dress, which was the starting point of my research,"" Henestrosa explained. ""We aim to provide a personal, political and cultural context for Kahlo's story.""

Growing up in a Westernized, upper-middle-class family, Kahlo had few traditional garments in her closet. However, despite her privileged upbringing, Kahlo was a vocal leftist, joining the socialist party when she was 16, and the Mexican Communist Party in her early twenties. For years she even claimed she born in 1910, the year the Mexican Revolution started, and was, as such a ""daughter of the Revolution.""

As a young adult, Kahlo surrounding herself with the freethinkers, socialists and intellectuals of Mexico City, with whom a growing appreciation precolonial Mexican heritage was on the rise. Among them was the famed Mexican muralist Diego Rivera , who would become her husband in 1929.

A fellow communist and supporter of the revolution, Rivera often created political murals that attacked the ruling class and capitalism, elevating Mexico's native heritage and anti-colonial efforts instead. So when he suggested Kahlo begin wearing traditional clothing as a show of Mexican pride, she embraced the idea wholeheartedly.

""Kahlo and Rivera shared a romanticized attachment to indigenous people, as did so many of the radical left at this time. The matriarchal society of the Tehuanas held a particular appeal for Kahlo, who was building her own image as an outsider: independent, but faithful to tradition, while at the same time embracing a modern, liberated lifestyle,"" Henestrosa said.

""Themes of female empowerment would be directly incorporated into her artwork through her self-portrayal in the style of the Isthmus (of Tehuantepec) women.""

To Kahlo, her dress was just another way to perform the beliefs she espoused through her political affiliations. She would mix her contemporary dresses with Huipil blouses with Mayan roots, where each pattern told the story of the wearer, for example, and showcase her mixed heritage by combining colonial silver earrings with indigenous necklaces of jadeite and onyx.

She also regularly wore rebozo scarves, either wrapping them around her shoulders or threading them through her braids. First introduced by the Spanish colonizers during Christopher Columbus' time -- only to be reworked by the Aztec villages with their traditional embroidery and eye-popping dyes, the rebozo was also worn by the women of the Mexican Revolution during the 1910s, when they were popular among the ""adelitas,"" female revolutionaries, who used the scarves to smuggle guns past government checkpoints, helping to oust a 35-year dictatorship. The accessory soon became a symbol of Mexico's fight for freedom, and by wearing the scarf, Kahlo was honoring both pre-colonial and post-revolution women alike.

""The rebozo is a piece that evolved during the colonial period to become a symbol of femininity and, after independence, nationhood,"" Henestrosa said.

The world has no choice but to take notice: As her fame grew, her image reached all corners of the world, from society dinners with the Rockefellers and gala openings in Paris to newspapers in the Midwest. And every time she was photographed or her name made the front page, she brought the rich history of Mexico with her.

The fashion community in particular was rapt. In 1937 she brought the rebozo to the American masses when she was featured in a Vogue article titled ""Senoras of Mexico,"" and in 1938, Italian designer Elsa Schiaparelli based ""La Robe de Madame Rivera"" (""Mrs. Rivera's Dress"") on the painter's iconic Tehuana costume featuring intricate red floral beading down the shirtfront, bringing Mexico's traditions to fashion's most exclusive circles.

But as her iconic look became ubiquitous, it began to lose its meaning. After her death, without her present to give voice to her politics, her image has been reduced to the superficial: a dress is just a dress, a scarf, just a scarf. This isn't only disrespectful to Kahlo's memory, but dangerous for her legacy.

In an essay written for the ""Frida Kahlo: Making Herself Up"" catalog, art historian and cultural theorist Oriana Baddeley pointedly summarized the issue: ""In Kahlo's case, there is the constant danger that the woman, not the artist becomes the focus of audience attention. Halloween costumes can evoke the appearance of Frida but not the artistic language of Kahlo,"" she writes.

""The cartoon characteristics of Fridamania so easily become parody obscuring the intelligence underpinning the work of one of the 20th century's great artists. It remains important to remember that it was Kahlo who first created Frida."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180611145644-frida-kahlo-olmec-figurine-super-tease.jpg

The dark depths of Lake Patricia in Canada still hide a secret that was once poised to change the course of World War II.

To gain the upper hand against the deadly German U-boats, the British had come up with a strange idea: make aircraft carriers out of giant icebergs. They were, after all, abundant, completely free and believed to be unsinkable. Crazy as it sounded, the project was approved by British prime minister Winston Churchill himself.

A prototype was built and tested at the lake over four months -- and parts of it remain there, 50 feet below the surface. The ice has long melted, but Project Habbakuk still lives.

Strategic material

In 1942, at a branch of the British War Office, an eccentric scientist named Geoffrey Pyke was trying to figure out how to protect Allied ships in the ""U-boat alley,"" an area of the Atlantic Ocean where Nazi submarines, out of the range of Allied warplanes, ruled the day. With building materials like steel in short supply, he thought, why not take a chunk of ice from the Arctic and tow it south to land planes on it?

""Pyke was a sort of holdover from the last Victorian boffins, someone we'd never take seriously now because he didn't have multiple degrees. But he did have credibility,"" Susan Langley , a professor at St. Mary's College of Maryland who's done doctoral research on the subject, said in a phone interview.

At the time, ice was considered almost indestructible: the International Ice Patrol , established to destroy icebergs after one had sunk the Titanic in 1912, had reported that blowing them up wasn't easy, even with torpedoes and incendiary bombs.

""Pyke thought ice was the new strategic material that would win the war,"" Langley said. ""And Churchill was willing to entertain the idea.""

He decided to call the ambitious design HMS Habbakuk, a misspelling of the name of prophet Habakkuk, who, in the Old Testament, wrote: ""...be utterly amazed, for I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.""

The largest warship ever

Building a warship out of ice was just as hard as it sounds. ""One problem was that if you wanted to launch aircraft off of something, it had to have 50 feet of freeboard above the water, but because icebergs are 90% submerged, that meant having almost 500 feet below the water,"" said Langley.

Such a vessel would be almost impossible to move. Also, when the tip of an iceberg melts, it makes it turn and roll, which would be a problem with aircraft trying to refuel on it. Finally, a flight deck of some other material was required for planes to land and take off.

""So they decided to have a hull of ice, but build it like a conventional ship, which meant it had to be kept frozen through some kind of refrigeration system.""

The proposed warship would be the largest ever built: 2,000 feet long and 200 feet wide -- more than twice as big as the Titanic -- with a weight of over 2 million tons and enough space for 300 aircraft. It would sail the seas at a speed of 7 knots (8 miles per hour) and withstand waves of 50 feet, giving Churchill his secret weapon against the U-boats.

He approved the project on Dec. 4, 1942 with a memo that was classified as ""Most secret,"" and asked for a prototype to be built.

'Mad wild schemes'

Britain now needed ice, so it turned to Canada for help. The experiment was assigned to the National Research Council, and the man in charge, C.J. MacKenzie, called the design ""another of those mad wild schemes.""

He chose Lake Patricia in the Jasper National Park in Alberta as the test site due to the availability of an ironic source of free labor nearby: a camp of conscientious objectors. ""They were never told what it was. They called it 'Noah's Ark.' They knew it was something for the war effort, but they didn't know what exactly,"" said Langley.

In early 1943, a 60-foot long prototype vessel was built with walls and floors of wood, tar, refrigeration pipes and a massive chunk of ice from the lake. ""It was like a big shoe box, with a giant ice cube in the middle and the refrigeration piping running around it like a rib cage. Frozen into the middle of the ice was a smaller rectangle, where the refrigeration unit was,"" said Langley.

A roof was put on top of the structure to protect it from the elements and disguise it as a boat house.

It worked, but it wasn't all smooth sailing. Some of the piping arrived damaged, so water couldn't be used for the cooling system and air was pumped through instead. There were doubts about the strength of the ice and the viability of the structure itself; although a better building material called ""pykrete"" (from Pyke and concrete) was developed around this time by adding wood pulp to the ice mix, it wasn't used in the prototype, and manufacturing it in the huge quantities needed for the Habbakuk seemed impractical.

Three factors

The test had shown that the ice ship wasn't pure fantasy. But by mid-1943, the project started to sink.

Its demise was a combination of three factors, according to Langley. First, Iceland could be used as a permanent base in the North Atlantic, which negated the need for floating aerodromes. Second, newer planes that could patrol for longer were introduced. And finally, the development of the centimetric radar helped track U-boats more accurately. The war was starting to turn in favor of the Allies.

""Those three things made it obsolete before it even reached fruition,"" said Langley. ""It was viable, but not at the scale that Churchill wanted and as quickly as he wanted. It was feasible to build the structure, but impractical to actually implement it.""

In June 1943, all testing in Canada was stopped and Churchill was informed.

What's down there?

Once the project was abandoned, the refrigeration machinery was removed and the model was just left there, before subsiding into the lake. Although most people in the area had a rough idea of what had been going on, some mystique started to grow around it.

Langley, who's also an underwater archeologist, overheard a conversation in 1982 about ""an airplane made of ice"" that was still in Lake Patricia. ""I thought that was impossible, but I wanted to find out more.""

So in 1984 she dived down to have a look. ""Good thing I had no idea what I was looking for, or I don't know what I would have thought, probably that a barge full of heating ducts or something had sunk. It was interesting, so I started getting grants to go back.""

Langley summarized her research and multiple dives to the wreckage in a Ph.D dissertation, and is also writing a book. Her work has contributed to the rise of a small influx of divers visiting the area to see for themselves.

The wreckage sits on a diagonal, with the deepest corner at the 100-foot depth. It's not the easiest of dives, because the lake is at a 4000-foot altitude in the Rockies, so there's an increased risk of decompression sickness. Visibility is low and it's fairly dark all the time, not to mention an algae bloom in the summer. To help identify the wreckage, an underwater commemorative plaque was installed in 1988 in its proximity.

""It's at the shallowest corner, so if you can dive to 85 feet, which is what most divers can do, you can go and have a look at it.""

It might be wise to hurry up, though, because not much is left.

""It's in terrible shape now, almost completely collapsed,"" said Langley. ""It's not sexy. Part of that is time, part is gravity, part is that it's been loved to death, because it's unusual and people love this story."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180423164137-project-habbakuk-illustration-super-tease.jpg

Stepping into the Wende Museum in Los Angeles is like traveling through time, right back to the Cold War era.

Its name means ""transformation,"" referring to the period of change that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Founded in 2002, the museum hosts more than 100,000 items that illustrate the culture of the former Eastern Bloc -- the largest collection of such objects outside Europe.

The collection has one of its strengths in the materials originating from East Germany -- officially known as the German Democratic Republic (GDR) -- which offer a travel guide to a country that only existed between 1949 and 1990. About 2,000 of these items, spanning propaganda poster to cosmetics, have been collected in ""The East German Handbook,"" a more compact version of another Taschen publication, "" Beyond the Wall ,"" that first cataloged East Germany's visual culture.

The book offers a comprehensive view of life in the country, showing both the mundane (toys, radios, hairspray) and the frightening (gas masks, straitjackets, training kits for detecting land mines), with a few delightful excursions into the kitschy.

6e49b64519bf448ba9e4c23e8cde6a3c	[]	2018-07-21 00:25:55+00:00	Out of the blue: A look back at Air Force One's classic design	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Out of the blue: A look back at Air Force One's classic design	1	"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

The current look of Air Force One is a true design classic. It dates back to 1962, and is the result of collaboration between JFK and Raymond Loewy, one of the fathers of industrial design.

But after more than five decades and eleven administrations, the elegant livery is getting a makeover. President Trump said he doesn't like the current aesthetics and intends to replace the blue hue. According to the media platform Axios, the President would like to make it look "" more American .""

Regardless of Trump's vision, it's highly likely that the next presidential plane will look different as the current aircraft approach the end of their lifespan and emerging technology makes a replacement necessary.

More than One

Air Force One is technically not the name of a plane, but rather the callsign used by air traffic controllers to refer to whatever aircraft is carrying the President. Popularly, though, it is the name given to the presidential plane, a modified Boeing model 747-200B, which under Air Force designation is known as a VC-25A. There are two of them, so that at least one is ready at all times. They're mostly identical except for their tail codes: SAM 28000 and SAM 29000 (SAM stands for Special Air Mission).

The callsign was adopted in 1953 , after the plane carrying President Eisenhower and a commercial airliner, both with the tail code 8610, dangerously entered the same airspace. The president's aircraft at that time was a prop plane -- a Lockheed C-121 Constellations nicknamed Columbine II -- but it was again Eisenhower who flew on the first presidential jet, a modified Boeing 707 that entered service in 1959. At that time, the planes were still full-fledged military aircraft and they sported a red, orange and black color scheme designed by the Air Force.

The radical redesign that still survives today debuted on a brand new Boeing 707 (or C-137 Stratoliner as the Air Force called it) with tail code SAM 26000. It entered service in October of 1962.

""It evolved from an interesting interaction between JFK, Jackie Kennedy and Raymond Loewy, who was a famed industrial designer,"" said Air Force One historian and former Smithsonian curator Von Hardesty in a phone interview.

French-born Loewy was among the most successful designers of his time, having created such icons as the Lucky Strike pack, Coca-Cola vending machines and the Greyhound buses, and popular logos for TWA, Exxon and Shell. ""He criticized the looks of the plane that had been delegated for presidential use, which had a garish orange nose and looked too much like a military plane. He wanted something that would reflect the presidency and he thought this was an opportunity to fashion a really compelling design, which arguably he did.""

'Seafoam' blue

Although one of Loewy's initial sketches included some red, the final design did not. The dominant blue paint job came at JFK's request. ""The seafoam blue and silver on the lower half was a stroke of genius to make the plane seem more horizontal and sleek,"" said designer and former president of the American Institute of Graphic Arts Sean Adams in an email interview.

""The seafoam is a surprising choice, but an elegant solution to the issue of making the plane sophisticated and modern, stepping away from the military look of Eisenhower's Air Force One. The plane spoke to an optimism, youth, and fresh approach that was perfect for the Kennedy administration,"" he added.

The plane remained in service until the Clinton administration, but it was replaced as the main presidential aircraft by another 707 in 1972. That particular airplane, tail code SAM 27000, was retired in 2001 after having served seven presidents: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.

Adams isn't thrilled at the prospect of a revamp. ""Air Force One is an identity with equity. It works,"" he said. ""Why make it look like a Walmart in the sky?""

Red, white and blue

During the Reagan administration work began on a new generation of Air Force Ones, with first lady Nancy curating the interior design. But due to a number of delays, the planes only entered service under George H. W. Bush in 1990. While almost every system was upgraded, the paint job was preserved. ""A good design brings with it a certain inertia and you really need to have a compelling reason to change it. By that point, it was so widely accepted and universally applauded that they just wanted the new 747 aircraft to have it too,"" said Harvesty.

These are the planes that are still in use today, and the Loewy design has undergone only minor amendments, due to the larger size of the 747s.

""It's faithful to the Raymond Loewy design as much as possible on a behemoth of a plane. It's hard to make a 747 look light and sophisticated, but the color, shapes, and typography do a great job. It maintains all the positives from the 1962 version. I'm especially glad that the 1980s didn't creep in on the design with mauve and almond,"" said Adams.

Earlier this month, Boeing confirmed it received a $3.9 billion contract for two new presidential planes. They will still be 747s -- albeit a newer version, the 747-8 -- even though the aging plane is being phased out by commercial airlines.

""The reason is that the Secret Service requires, in the interest of safety, that the President should fly only on four-engine aircraft. The 747 also provides more space for the President, his key staff, and the complex communications equipment required for the president to be in touch with anyone in the world at all times,"" said aviation expert Gene Eisman in an email interview.

But most importantly, they will sport a new look : ""Air Force One is going to be incredible,"" Trump said in a CBS interview . ""It's going to be the top of the line, the top in the world. And it's going to be red, white and blue, which I think is appropriate.""

How exactly this will play out is still unclear. It's unlikely but Trump could even decide to repaint the current planes instead of waiting for the new ones, which will only enter service by 2024 (though the President has requested that the planes be ready sooner in 2021).

According to Von Hardesty, there are no fixed rules regarding the implementation of Air Force One's design, so anything can happen. ""I love the current design. But perhaps the President's motivation is that the aircraft should reflect more explicitly a sense of American patriotism, and red, white and blue, of course, are synonyms of that. If the president wants to review and possibly change the livery, there is no historical precedent that stands in the way of him doing so,"" he said.

But he added, ""I hope they will pull something off that's pleasing and acceptable to everyone. I just hope it doesn't become some ugly debate."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180717113814-05-af1-design-super-tease.jpg

While early 20th-century Hollywood film posters peddled romance and glamour, Russia steered away from the easy marketing of celebrities, and focused instead on creative design.

Spurred by the Bolshevik uprising and the previous era of autocratic rule, Russia's avant-garde artists believed creativity was a tool to improve people's lives. (Popular slogans like ""Art into Life"" and ""Art into Technology"" epitomized this way of thinking.) These artists disrupted all rules to create a new graphic order that took center stage in the posters.

To mark the centennial of Russia's October revolution, collector Susan Pack published a book of rare avant-garde Russian film posters, which she began gathering in the 1970s.

Film Posters of the Russian Avant-Garde "" assembles the best of Pack's hoard, a connoisseur's dream that includes 250 posters by 27 artists from the pre-Stalin Soviet Union -- before Stalin decreed Socialist Realism was the only authorized art form was

Revolutionary art

Many of the designers who jumped on the poster bandwagon came from more traditional artistic backgrounds. The Stenberg Brothers , for example, started as Constructivist sculptors and set designers, and the prolific artist Alexander Rodchenko worked in photography, architecture and industrial design.

""They montaged disparate elements, such as adding photography to lithography, and juxtaposed the action from one scene with a character from another,"" Pack writes. ""They colored human faces with vivid colors, elongated and distorted body shapes, gave animal bodies to humans and turned film credits into an integral part of the design.""

As filmmaking established itself as an art form, so to did these posters and their designers, who often hadn't even seen the films they were advertising and worked from press kits sent from Hollywood.

Their rare works, which were only meant to be seen for a few weeks, are now grouped in a book that will keep them away from oblivion."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171025115111-russian-posters-tease-1-super-tease.jpg

The enclave at the east end of New York's Long Island peninsula hosts chaotic summer crowds, but things slow down considerably in early fall, making it the best time to visit this Hamptons hub.

The crowds are gone, the weather is still nice, you can actually get dinner reservations and the hotel rates are much more affordable.

And you'll have plenty of room to spread your towels on popular beaches such as Ditch Plains and admire the surfers who prefer to avoid the busy summer months.

Where to eat

Duryea's Lobster Deck boasts a scenic location, an amazing Lobster Cobb salad and more. Jason Penney

The town of Montauk has tons of great dining options, and going out to eat here has a much more casual vibe than other parts of the Hamptons.

In the morning, a breakfast wrap from Joni's Kitchen and an iced turmeric latte from Left Hand Coffee hit the spot. In the same area you can also find Bluestone Lane Coffee and Goldberg's bagels.

Herb's Market is great for groceries and deli sandwiches, and on busy weekends they also have a secret late-night menu that comes in handy when you need a burger and fries pick-me-up.

Sit-down dining options are so abundant it's almost overwhelming, but there are some standouts.

Duryea's Lobster Deck is great for lunch or dinner. They are known for their Lobster Cobb salad which you definitely shouldn't miss, but they also have an excellent clam chowder and a selection of decadent seafood platters. It's a great place to dine with a group as the plates are large and perfect for sharing.

Swallow East is a nice spot for a group dinner that doesn't break the bank. While the décor may not be trendy, there's live music and really solid food that's served family style.

Menu highlights include the tuna poke, flank steak, orzo mac 'n cheese and asparagus ""fries."" Most of the dishes range from $15-$25.

A great spot for a sit-down lunch or dinner right in town is The Gig Shack. While it may not look like much from the outside, it serves up some of the best seafood in the game and even has an Instagram-famous bartender. The spicy tuna tartare taquitos, Caesar salad with blackened fish, fish tacos or margaritas are all worth a hit.

Navy Beach, a casual beachfront eatery, takes the cake for the best place to watch the sunset, but it can get a little rowdy during ""magic hour,"" especially in the summer months. It's without a doubt the place to experience the sunset known as ""Montauk Magic.""

For something a bit fancier, The Crow's Nest is one of the most beautiful properties in Montauk. Don't sweat it if you have to wait for your table, they also have a bar down by the water to pass the time until dinner.

Dinner menu highlights include the local fluke and yellowfin crudo, fresh whipped ricotta, blue crab claw tagliatelle and the East Coast halibut.

Where to drink

Even if you came to Montauk to relax, it's worth checking out some of the bars. Options are more limited as summer winds down, with many bars closing for the season in September.

But the bar at the fire pit at Gurney's Montauk Resort is one of the best spots in town and it's open during the fall months.

The deck is situated far enough from the rooms that the late-night crowd doesn't disturb hotel guests. The crowd is eclectic, from Instagram influencers to Wall Street execs.

Most of the bars in Montauk also have a restaurant and many are attached to hotels. Pro-tip for the busy season: Make a dinner reservation to skip long lines in the evening. (But that shouldn't be a problem in the fall).

At Ruschmeyers, a resort that closes for the season in early October, the expansive lawn and fire pit evoke summer camp. Plus they have a killer lobster roll.

On lively weekends the place is packed, but the outside area is large enough to escape the chaos. For those who like to dance, there's a backroom that fills up post-midnight.

The Surf Lodge Deck -- one of the best places to have drinks in all of the Hamptons -- is a former Irish dive bar turned Hamptons hot spot.

Surf Lodge shuts at the end of September for the winter. During the summer months, it hosts a concert series featuring some pretty noteworthy names: St. Lucia, AlunaGeorge, Noname, Skylar Grey and Jessie J, to name a few.

Lower Manhattan bar Grey Lady also has an outpost in Montauk. It's closed by mid September, but the rustic spot with a great area for food and drinks outside is definitely worth a visit when the season rolls around again.

Another seasonal venue, Memory Motel stays open until 4 a.m. for night owls. The dance floor is always packed in season. And yes, this is an actual motel where the party usually spills out onto the lawn in front of the rooms.

Most people who frequent Montauk rent homes for the summer or are lucky enough to know someone who owns a place, but for those headed out for a weekend, there are plenty of lovely hotels to choose from.

Gurney's Montauk Resort & Seawater Spa is the only five-star resort in Montauk. Gurney's is open year-round and has everything you'd ever want right on the property: an exclusive beach club during the day, great dining and 146 gorgeous rooms, suites and beach cottages with ocean views.

The resort features other exclusive amenities such as pop-up fitness classes led by best-of-the-best NYC instructors and Higher Dose infrared saunas. And if you like it so much you'd like to move in, you can. Gurney's residences are situated adjacent to the resort and allow home owners to enjoy all the amenities of the hotel.

Gurney's s the essence of luxury and lifestyle in Montauk, and this top resort brand is only continuing to expand.

Gurney's Resorts recently purchased the Montauk Yacht Club Resort, now known as Gurney's Montauk Yacht Club & Resort. The new property is set to close its doors this winter to undergo $13 million in renovations before next summer. This sister property will likely attract many patrons of the Gurney's brand and offer a different experience situated on Lake Montauk.

Hero Beach Club is a simpler yet still trendy spot. While it doesn't have all of the amenities of the Gurney's resorts, it's situated on a quiet beach and is closer to town.

Montauk has gone from a sleepy town to a Hamptons hot spot. Jeremy Garretson

Outside of dining, nightlife and the breathtaking beaches, there is also a budding wellness scene in Montauk.

For detoxers, there are pop-up work out classes at both Gurney's properties as well as Surf Lodge.

Many studios in NYC also have permanent outposts right in Montauk. New York Pilates has never been better than taking a class overlooking the ocean, and the ever-popular Soul Cycle also has a studio right in town.

And call us old-fashioned, but nothing beats a run along Old Montauk Highway.

Getting there

Getting to Montauk -- 125 miles from New York City -- is no easy task, but it's definitely worth the trip. From NYC, you can travel by air (sea plane or helicopter), car or train (Long Island Railroad).

Flying out to Montauk is definitely the fastest way to get there, but it comes with a hefty price tag. BLADE offers regularly scheduled flights to South Hampton, East Hampton and Montauk. You can choose to buy a seat on a scheduled flight or charter a private flight.

Just one seat on a BLADE flight costs about $795 but will get you to Montauk in about 40 minutes.

Flying is by far the most luxurious option, but for something more cost-effective, the train does the trick.

As if made from the same mold, shiny, glittering terminals have become a status symbol for any city with aspirations.

But all of this is a world away from the remoteness of Russia's Arctic regions and the Siberian wilderness.

Here you'll discover an entirely different type of airport, built in the mid-20th century when the Soviet Union saw in air transport a way to expand the state's reach to every corner of its territory, even if that meant little more than a dirt runway and a radio shack.

You won't find huge duty-free shops, fast food joints or big-name fashion brands, but Russia's wooden airports have a beauty of their own.

Some are a little dilapidated, but even then their frailness and simplicity give them a unique and charming character.

Here's a travel guide to some of Russia's most remarkable wooden airports. But a warning to would-be visitors: Although many of them see regular airline service, getting there can be quite an adventure.

Solovki

Solovki Airport is the gateway to the Solovetsky Islands, an archipelago located in the White Sea, right below the Arctic Circle in the European part of Russia.

Solovki is possibly the most touristy airport on this list, thanks to visitors who come to see the 15th-century Solovetsky Monastery, an architectural wonder also built entirely in wood, which has been granted World Heritage Site status by UNESCO.

There's regular service from here to Arkhangelsk, one of the major cities in northern Russia.

Also on the shores of the White Sea, but on the mainland and not far from the aforementioned Solovetsky Islands, this airport serves a tiny settlement whose name translates as ""Summer Gold.""

The 180 local inhabitants have the company of a colony of harp seals, a local attraction that keeps visitors coming ... by air, of course.

Mezen

A bit farther north, but still in the region of Arkhangelsk, is Mezen Airport, whose wooden structure is painted a distinctive pale blue.

It was built during World War II at a spot that had already been hosting, since the 19th century, a weather station.

It currently handles some 6,000 passengers per year and also serves as a stepping stone to reach even more remote locations throughout the Russian north.

Seymchan

Seymchan is one of the prettiest of Russia's wooden airports. sever.aero

Magadan Oblast, on Russia's far east coast, is a quiet, often lonely place with a population of just over 150,000 -- the smallest of all Russia's oblasts.

However, during World War II it became part of a busy air corridor, the ALSIB, the Alaska-Siberian air route that delivered essential supplies from the US to the then-allied Soviet Union. Seymchan's airport, with its fairytale-like charm, was built in 1942 as part of that war effort.

The airport has regular service to Magadan, the regional capital.

Seen from afar, you could mistake Uorgalan Airport for one of those hotels built in faux-Alpine style that are so common at mountain resorts all over the world.

Uorgalan Airport is indeed located in a mountain area, but a very special one.

The Kondyor Massif is a rare geological formation: an example of a perfect circular intrusion -- that is, a crater-like circle of mountains of volcanic origin.

The role of the airport in this distant corner of Khabarovsk Krai, in Russia's Far East, is to service a platinum mine in operation right at the center of the Kondyor Massif.

Also in the same region, you can find wooden airports at Nel'kan and Mar-Kyuyel'.

Fewer than a million people live in the Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia, a Siberian territory nearly five times the size of France, a large part of it made of endless expanses of taiga forest.

No wonder then that wood is the material of choice for many of the airports that dot this vast region, where air transport is often the only way to reach isolated communities.

Turukhansk, Yeniseisk and Khatanga

Next to the Sakha Republic is Krasnoyarsky Krai, another huge region with its share of wooden airports.

Three of the most remarkable are Turukhansk, whose old terminal resembles a large barn, Yeniseisk and Khatanga.

Although its facilities are somewhat dilapidated, Khatanga is one of the busiest airports in the Arctic confines of Russia, with over 34,000 passengers in 2017.

It's a staging post for polar expeditions and it has also been designated a diversionary airport for aircraft flying over the uninhabited expanses of Northern Siberia.

Khatanga Airport is capable of handling mid-sized jet airliners such as the Tupolev Tu-154, or even the larger Ilyushin Il-86, and it currently has scheduled service to the regional capital, Krasnoyarsk, as well as the Arctic mining town of Norilsk.

There are plans to upgrade the airport infrastructure.

Igrim

In the oil and gas basin of Western Siberia, Igrim Airport has a wooden terminal and what is surely one of the longest dirt runways supporting commercial operations in Russia.

It handles scheduled and seasonal flights to several larger cities in the region, such as Khanty-Mansiysk,Tyumen and Surgut.

Chara

This airport serves the village of Chara, which was once the center of the Trans-Baikal Gulag. zavodfoto.ru/zavodfoto.livejournal.com

It might look like a hunting lodge, but some 8,000 passengers a year use this airport, which only operates during daylight hours.

Local carrier Angara Airlines operates scheduled flights to the regional capital Chita, near the shores of Lake Baikal.

Khuzhir

And while we're talking Lake Baikal, a mention is due to Khuzhir, another example of Russian wooden airport architecture.

Although it's located on Lake Baikal's Olkhon Island, a tourist destination in its own right, Khuzhir Airport has been officially closed for more than 20 years.

Yet this hasn't deterred former pilot Vladimir Prokopyev and his wife Herolda from continuing to watch over it and keep it service-ready, as in the old Soviet times when it was visited three or four times a day by 12-seater An-12 aircraft. Even the radio set is in working order.

Nowadays only the occasional sports plane makes an unscheduled stop, yet the elderly couple who call this airport home have preserved it as a time capsule from a bygone era."	https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F180911143209-seymchan-airport-super-tease.jpg

Some may say history or culture. But others may say nightlife, and they wouldn't necessarily be wrong.

It seems like the capital of Germany has been teaching the world how to party and play for a long time now. It's a top destination for those who want to enjoy themselves with abandon.

Here's a small sampling of suggested nightlife spots when you travel here, from the unapologetically hedonistic to the proudly traditional. Be sure to check each club's particulars on dress codes and such before you waste time standing in a line. Some can be very particular about who gets in.

SO36

Located in the trendy Kreuzberg district that's long been a home for alternative lifestyles, the name SO36 comes from the postal codes used back when the Berlin Wall was a thing.

The club is known for live music performances, and it has special event nights such as '80s dance parties or roller disco lessons. It has its roots in the punk movement but has now moved on to showcase other genres, too: techno, hip hop, crossover and more. While not specifically a gay or lesbian club, it has a large following in those communities and does not pander to any sexist, racist or homophobic language or behavior.

Some of the bands that have played there: Life of Agony, The Cramps and Church of Confidence.

Tresor

Tresor started out in a shack on Potsdamer Platz in 1991 with a three-month license to operate as an art gallery.

More than 25 years later and a new location, it's a veritable institution. In its cellar, one of its dance floors is set between old bank safes where people are surrounded by dense fog and a musical sound in the vault inspired by DJs and artists from Detroit, Michigan.

This legend in the techno music scene also has its own record label. Berlin nightclubs can be notoriously picky about who can enter, but Tresor has a more visitor-friendly reputation

This is where to go if your style is jazz. This small venue has been operating since 1992 but has had a big effect on the Berlin jazz scene, drawing talent from around the world.

Notables such as Herbie Hancock, Diana Krall, Wynton Marsalis, trumpeter Till Brönner, American pianist Uri Caine and Italian trumpeter Enrico Rava have played here, to give you an idea of the jazz styles you might hear during its regular evening concerts.

A-Trane is also known for its jam sessions after midnight Saturday when the regular show is done. It's in the Charlottenburg district.

A-Trane : Pestalozzistrasse 105, 10625 Berlin, Germany; +49 30 3132550

Kit Kat Club

Do not expect to gain entrance to the Kit Kat in ordinary jeans and T-shirt. This club unabashedly celebrates fetish wear and minimal clothing. The more daring and extravagant you arrive, the better the Kit Kat likes it and the better your chances for entry.

The vibe is beach sex party meets S&M club. The club's Saturday night party ""CarneBall Bizarre"" promises a raucous time with techno, trance and other styles of music conducive to a sexually charged scene. The Kit Kat suggests a Friday night visit for something more low-key and intimate.

Just be very clear about what you're going to be walking into: The club's website has a discussion board with topics such as a person's role in a threesome.

Berlin's nightlife scene is nothing particularly new. If you want to go old school with your night out and do a little ""time travel,"" try Clärchens Ballhaus, which has been around more than a century

Your can relive the glamor of bygone 1920s Berlin at this restaurant and dancing club. The menu has traditional dishes such as wiener schnitzel and pickled herring. And Clärchens offers lessons if you need to brush up your more traditional dance moves.

If you're not up for a night out, you can book a tour of the amazing building that houses it.

It's on the top floor of the 25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin and sports great views. In fact, sunset is actually a popular time here.

It has an extensive cocktail menu with drinks such as the Monkey Monk (gin, chartreuse yellow, fresh mint, fresh lime juice, sugar syrup, soda). And unlike a lot of Berlin clubs with their dress codes, the Monkey Bar says ""come as you are.""

Berghain

Widely considered the ""best nightclub in the world,"" the publicity-averse Berghain draws a singularly eclectic mix: scenesters, misfits, bondage-clad muscled gay men, rich kids, Skrillex-haired lesbians, DJs, drag queens, tourists, old, young, whoever.

The line can take hours to get through, and then you might not make it past the doorman. But if you do, don't be surprised if you're there till next Monday morning.

71e68c1f5c314094b9734cd5e2005282	[]	2018-09-20 08:36:31+00:00	Spike Island: Unraveling the mysteries of 'Ireland's Alcatraz'	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Spike Island: Unraveling the mysteries of 'Ireland's Alcatraz'	1	"(CNN) — A star-shaped fortress atop a picturesque island off the southwest coast of Ireland once housed one of the world's biggest prison populations.

While today Spike Island welcomes boatloads of tourists -- much like Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay or Robben Island off the coast of South Africa -- in Victorian times it was a place that many never left, with more than 1,000 prisoners dying there in less than four years.

In an attempt to learn more about the men who perished on this prison island, bioarchaeologist Barra O'Donnabhain began excavating the convict graveyard in 2013.

Over the past five years, O'Donnabhain and his team have uncovered some of the mysteries buried on Spike Island -- including a grizzly procedure long ago carried out on dead prisoners' corpses.

How an island became a prison

Spike Island -- often described as ""Ireland's Alcatraz"" -- has a multilayered history.

Early records indicate the 104-acre island might have been a 6th-century monastic settlement. It gradually developed into a British military base in the 18th century, before it became a depot for convicts waiting to be shipped to Britain's penal colonies, such as Australia and Bermuda.

""The prison was opened as a crisis response by the government to the Great Famine and to the perceived rise in criminality, because the court system at the time punished theft very harshly,"" explains O'Donnabhain, an archaeology professor at University College Cork in Ireland.

From 1847, men and boys as young as 12 were sent to Spike Island, some for crimes that would today be considered trivial offenses, such as stealing potatoes.

'Hell on Earth'

But by 1853 the number of prisoners on the island had risen to 2,500, making it possibly the biggest prison in the British Empire at the time, if not the world, in terms of the number of prisoners, according to O'Donnabhain.

Up to 40 prisoners were sardined in each dormitory-style room -- measuring 40 feet by 18 feet -- and there were no individual cells save for the punishment block, used to detain the most dangerous criminals.

A number of accounts from the time detail how solitary confinement in the prison's punishment block was like ""hell on Earth."" Over 1,000 prisoners died on the island and were buried in mass unmarked graves. Spike Island

Various convict accounts from the punishment block detail how prisoners were heavily chained from wrist to ankle and severely broken from enduring what they described as ""Hell on Earth.""

The prison's draconian regime of forced labor coupled with poor living conditions and an inadequate diet meant convicts died almost daily in the early years, explains O'Donnabhain.

Digging up Spike

Records indicate that one of the island's two graveyards, which O'Donnabhain hasn't yet excavated, holds upwards of 1,000 prisoners who died before 1860.

O'Donnabhain and his team have excavated 35 burials from the other graveyard, which was used from 1860 onwards. By this point the number of deaths had drastically reduced to approximately one per month.

Arcaheologists excavate one of Spike Island's prison graveyards. Barra O'Donnabhain

He says he was surprised by the element of care employed when prisoners buried their fellow inmates, particularly by how carefully they painted the cheap pine coffins to look like oak coffins.

""I read it as a gift from one prisoner to another,"" says O'Donnabhain. ""You're being buried in a convict graveyard on a convict island that's out of bounds to the rest of society, and yet your peers are just taking care to make a statement that this person was of some worth.""

Skulls for 'science'?

But one of the most curious discoveries was that a handful of skeletons had the top of their skulls removed.

O'Donnabhain speculates that this might have been part of a wider study in the 1870s spearheaded by Italian scientist Cesare Lombroso to identify the characteristic physical features of the ""born criminal.""

""Lombroso did a lot of autopsies of hanged criminals, and he found a particular variation in the architecture of the skull which he said is the sign of the 'natural born criminal,'"" explains O'Donnabhain.

Unsurprisingly, Lombroso's theories have long been discredited

But O'Donnabhain says he can't be certain that that's exactly what they were doing on Spike Island.

Writing's on the wall

The prison housed convicts from 1847 to 1883. ""There were a lot of prisoners who were there for things we would not regard as crime today, and sentenced to hard labor,"" says historian Gillian O'Brien of Liverpool John Moores University. Spike Island

When the 19th century prison closed in 1883, the island resumed its original function as a military barracks, only to re-open as a prison from 1985 to 2004.

When O'Donnabhain arrived nearly a decade later he says the sheets were literally still on the beds.

So, before he began excavating, his team documented the modern graffiti scrawled by 20th century prisoners.

""What really struck me in doing that work was the continuity between the Victorian prison and the modern prison,"" says O'Donnabhain.

The graffiti on the walls detailed the prisoners' nicknames, sentences, and hometowns. O'Donnabhain says these modern prisoners came from the same ""blackspots of social disadvantage"" as prisoners during the Victorian era.

""You see exactly the same dynamic in the sense that it's primarily the poor who end up in prison and its people from socially disadvantaged backgrounds,"" he says.

Spike Island first opened to the public in 2016 and was named ""Europe's Leading Tourist Attraction"" at the World Travel Awards last year.

a8a9d3992da04fffa003db212425bb84	[]	2018-09-20 01:44:18+00:00	Celebrity Edge: Is this the future of cruise ships?	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Celebrity Edge: Is this the future of cruise ships?	1	"Saint-Nazaire, France (CNN) — In an age of ever-bigger cruise ships, it can be hard to stand out without constructing something the size of a small city and pushing it out to sea.

Now, instead of just ramping up the scale of their vessels, cruise operators are starting to innovate with boat design, ripping up the rulebooks on marine engineering to create something very different.

The latest example of this is Celebrity Edge , a large -- but not super-massive -- vessel currently under construction in the Chantiers d'Atlantique shipyard on the northwestern coast of France.

From the outside, it might look like a standard, albeit glamorous, cruise ship.

But Edge has something unusual going on inside -- an innovative endoskeleton design that owner Celebrity Cruises claims will make seagoing travel more epic than ever.

All previous large cruise liners have relied on centuries-old shipbuilding principles that require a solid hull to hold the vessel together. By shifting the spine to the center, Celebrity Edge's sides have been opened up -- allowing maximum light and the potential to create suites with incredible panoramic ocean views.

It's been entirely designed using 3D technology, enabling engineers to push the boundaries of what's possible, while still creating something that can float and withstand the rigors of plying the high seas.

Celebrity says that when Edge's first passengers set sail from Florida to the Caribbean in December 2018, they'll be as close to the ocean as it's possible to get on a cruise ship without, presumably, jumping over the rail.

The price tag for creating this experience is a hefty $1 billion -- and there's a sister ship, Celebrity Apex, due to launch in 2020.

With 28 million passengers expected to take to the waters globally in 2018 (up from 24.7 million in 2017), such a large investment may well be worth it.

But Royal Caribbean Cruises , Celebrity's parent company, must stand out in a crowded field. Chief rivals Carnival and Norwegian are also building new vessels to capture their slice of an estimated $45.6 billion market.

So will Celebrity Edge live up the hype?

CNN Travel got a preview of Edge in the midst of the frenetic work to get the ship launch-ready at the French shipyard.

As morning fog was quickly burned away by a warm sun, the ship emerged, looming over the dockside, by all appearances ready to set sail -- minus a neighboring large crane. Celebrity says that as of September 2018, it's 95.6% ready.

""That doesn't sound like much to go, but the part to go, that is all the visible part,"" says Richard Fain, chairman and CEO of Royal Caribbean Cruises, on hand to give a tour.

There are workmen everywhere. At this point, exploration of the ship requires protective hard hats and goggles. Last minute touch ups to the paintwork are being made in one corner. Wood is being sawed in another. Carpets are being unfurled and cleaned.

The work is intense, but with the ship's superstructure completed and afloat, Celebrity Cruises is excited about what it believes will be a game-changing design.

""It was never our intention with Edge to have a bigger ship,"" Celebrity CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo tells CNN Travel.

But her team did want to make a splash, and so harnessed technology to explore new frontiers.

Fain says the extent of 3D computer modeling in Edge's creation is unprecedented.

""Every ship in the last decade has used 3D renderings [...] to understand what they're building,"" he says. ""But this was entirely done in three dimensions and it's given us the ability to do things that you couldn't do before.""

By shifting the boat's spine, the design team's vision of floor-to-ceiling windows, ""infinite verandas"" in bedrooms and ocean views on display wherever possible became a reality.

""Ships have traditionally been built with what's known as an exoskeleton, so the skeleton's on the outside of the ship,"" says Fain. ""But if the skeleton's on the outside of the ship, that means that the outside of the ship is essentially sealed.""

So how come this has never been done before?

It has, explains Fain, just not on this scale.

That's why the Edge's infinite verandas are so striking. They're featured in each of the ship's 1,467 staterooms, created by celebrated interior designer Kelly Hoppen.

And yes, they're impressive, even when the ship's berthed next to what is essentially a construction site.

The balcony merges seamlessly with the room. A simple press of a button turns the veranda into a self-contained space, then the vast windows can be pushed down to open the balconies directly onto the ocean.

""We can essentially put nothing between the cabin and the balcony,"" says Fain.

They weren't ready during CNN's September visit, but when Edge premieres, there are apparently going to be six two-story luxury villas on board too, each with its own private plunge pool.

Grand designs

Elsewhere, the ship has all the glitz and swagger you'd expect of a new vessel aimed at upscale cruise passengers.

The ambitious Grand Plaza forms the centerpiece of the ship. The impressive chandelier -- part light fixture, part art installation, containing 765 blades made from LED strips -- is already illuminating the area where passengers will socialize and dine in fancy bistros and restaurants.

The interior of the ship is the work of Paris design team Jouin Manku -- which was involved in the Jules Verne restaurant in the Eiffel Tower . The concept is a fusion of modern touches with inspiration from the golden age of transatlantic travel.

""It is designed in a modern luxury elegant way,"" says Lutoff-Perlo. ""I always think about our ships or describe our ships as beautiful boutique hotels sailing around the world.""

Celebrity Cruises is keen to stress the seaworthiness of its new design, describing the construction process in detail.

Fain explains that ships of this type are assembled like Lego bricks, ceiling first.

""They start the blocks upside down and they do them in small sections and then they flip them over, which I always find fascinating,"" he says.

Once the ship is delivered into the water, it has to undergo two sea trials. One is purposefully rough, to fully test the ship's limit. Edge has already passed that one successfully.

The ship also has what's called a parabolic ultrabow, another Celebrity Cruises innovation that, it's claimed, will help make it more energy efficient -- a pressing concern both financially and environmentally.

This builds on pre-existing ""bulbous bow"" designs by locating the ship's propellers to the front of the vessel, reducing drag in the water.

""It still has a bulbous bow, it's just included in this extra sheathing which allows the ship the energy efficiency. The propellers are forward not back, so there's nothing to interrupt the water coming into the propeller,"" explains Fain.

Above the water line, Edge has plenty of overly opulent features.

The pool deck is dominated by two giant hot tubs shaped like martini glasses. On the top deck, a giant X-marks-the-spot is surrounded by a rooftop garden with tree-like sculptures.

The spa wasn't ready when CNN Travel visited, but has also been designed by Hoppen and is going to span 22,000 square feet.

The Magic Carpet

And then there's the so-called ""Magic Carpet,"" which is pretty cool.

It's an orange moving platform that forms an extension to the ship and moves up and down its side, taking on a different role depending on its position. It doesn't move when people are on it.

The platform can move from deck 16, right at the top, down to deck 2, to assist with tendering -- the boarding and disembarking of passengers at various cruise destinations.

""Originally we created it to be a tendering platform, to make that experience a lot better,"" says Brian Abel, Edge's SVP of hotel operations. ""Than we realized we only use that like 20% of the time. So what else are we going to do with it? That's when we came up with the idea of making it move as a restaurant or extension of the pool deck or special dinner.

""It's a nice way to leave the ship and get back on, when you get back on we'll have music playing -- with champagne and water -- and all the other boats will be like 'What's going on on that ship?'"" laughs Abel.

Bookings for Celebrity Edge have already been brisk, according to Celebrity Cruises. But while the vessel's novelty touches will help create a buzz, the challenge will be maintaining its appeal to generate a return on that $1 billion investment.

""Having seen Celebrity Edge in its final stages of construction, I believe it genuinely will be a game-changer,"" Sue Bryant, cruise editor at the UK's Sunday Times, tells CNN Travel.

""There's some really innovative design, not least the clever balcony cabins, which are much bigger than those on rival ships, and the Magic Carpet, a platform that serves as an al fresco restaurant suspended over the side of the ship. On a warm night in the Caribbean, I reckon that will be the hot ticket for dinner.""

Bryant adds that the ship could attract the attention of the millennial market -- ""people who might previously have considered themselves too cool for cruising.""

164408d2129d48f8b10226c5184009b5	[]	2018-09-25 15:43:41+00:00	Lofoten Islands of Norway: Take an Arctic beach vacation	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Lofoten Islands of Norway: Take an Arctic beach vacation	1	"(CNN) — Northern Norway may not spring instantly to mind for those planning a beach vacation. Yet the golden sands of the remote Lofoten Islands draw photographers, surfers and backpackers from the world over.

A road trip along the narrow roads of Norway's Lofoten Islands inevitably takes hours longer than planned. Around every bend there's another breathtaking vista, an even more dramatic mountain, or yet another fishing village of red wooden huts that just begs to be explored.

For those who venture off the E10, one of Norway's 18 designated National Tourist Routes , Lofoten's secrets are worth discovering.

While the islands are best known for their spiky landscape, idyllic waterside villages, Northern Lights displays and world-class hiking, it's the beaches that are the biggest travel surprise.

A mild climate

The islands enjoy an oceanic climate far milder than their latitude would suggest. In fact, the temperature is most often compared to that of Seattle or Quebec City, which lie 20 degrees farther south on the globe.

Locals make the most of the climate anomaly by heading to the beaches on sunny days, yet with ice-cold water and few facilities it doesn't attract the typical beach-seeker. Backpackers, hikers, photographers and surfers are the new Lofoten tourists.

The seaweed-strewn sands, jagged mountain peaks and large boulders fading into the waves create a dramatic setting for watersports and filmmakers alike.

While the summer offers a mild climate for camping, many photographers hope to strike it lucky with a Northern Lights show, most likely to occur in late winter or the fall. More still come to capture the beauty of the coastline after a snowfall.

A world-famous surfing destination

Unheard of by most Norwegians, Unstad Beach is a name familiar to cold-water surfers around the world.

Since 2007, the Lofoten Masters has grown from a local surf gathering to an international standard competition. Legend has it that two locals discovered surfing on a trip down under. Upon returning, they fashioned their own makeshift surfboards and a new community was born.

Nearby Haukland Beach is a strip of white sand by blue-green water reminiscent of a Caribbean island. Although camping is not permitted, it's a perfect spot for lunch or a stroll.

Just a few miles further north is arguably the most famous of Lofoten's beaches. Uttakleiv Beach is north-facing and so attracts aurora hunters in great numbers, while wild camping under the midnight sun on the beach itself or the grassland beyond is popular in the summer.

Hiking opportunities

Extreme surf photographer Chris Burkard travels to find Arctic swells in sub-zero temperatures.

More beaches dot the coastal stretch of the E10 around the small communities of Flakstad and Ramberg on the northern shore of Flakstadøya island.

The best of the bunch is the flat, sandy Skagsanden Beach, a haven for photographers and Northern Lights hunters all year round thanks to its north-facing aspect and the impressive backdrop of the Hustinden mountain.

The two- to three-hour moderate hike to the summit of the 2,267-foot-high (690 meters) mountain is a worthwhile way to spend the day.

Despite its golden sands, shallow turquoise waters, and the Ryten mountain's steep cliffs making this one of the most picturesque beaches on the islands, Kvalvika Beach is often deserted because it's only accessible by foot.

The one-hour hike is straightforward, but the rocky trail can be slippery after rainfall.

Although facilities are non-existent, camping at the grassy dunes and beach is permitted and indeed recommended in the summer for an outstanding view of the midnight sun with very few others around.

""There are no houses, no power cables, just you and a hiking trail. The scale, isolation and the drama of these beaches are unmatched,"" says Cody Duncan , a professional landscape photographer from California who now calls the trails of Lofoten his home.

Tourism comes at a price

As much as the beauty of Lofoten is a major tourist draw, local authorities are caught in a quandary. Each summer the complaints from locals get louder. Norway's freedom to roam laws allow wild camping, but not all visitors clean up after themselves and traffic is an increasing problem.

""The local government needs to react before it's too late,"" says Duncan. ""There's been talk of providing public restrooms at some locations and a shuttle bus from a nearby school to the trailhead for Kvalvika Beach for example, but aside from some trail maintenance and basic signage there hasn't been much action.""

Beyond the beaches and the hiking, Lofoten offers much for the curious traveler, and those just wanting to relax.

While full-service hotels are available at the attractive harbor of Svolvær, the islands' biggest town, far more atmospheric accommodation is available. Snagging a simple wooden cabin (hytte) or a traditional fisherman's hut (rorbu) offers a taste of the quiet life.

Getting there is half the fun

Getting to Lofoten is half the fun. Domestic airline Widerøe is experimenting with direct flights from Oslo to Svolvær, but these are expensive and infrequent.

Other times, as with India's new Pakyong Airport, it's a breathtaking piece of engineering on the roof of the world.

Set in the Himalayan mountains at a height of over 1,400 meters (4,593 feet), the facility serving a remote area of Sikkim state offers one of the most dramatic airport approaches on the planet.

Its inauguration on Monday also marked a milestone for aviation and travel in India

""After the opening of the airport there are now 100 operational airports in India."" said Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, during a speech at Pakyong's opening ceremony on Monday.

""This airport was built at a cost of $68.7 million and showcases our engineers, workers and their potential -- how the mountains were cleared, the ditch was filled, the heavy rains they dealt with. This is truly an amazing feat of engineering.""

As part of that work, an 80.38 meter embankment was built to make space for the 1.7-kilometer-long and 30-meter-wide runway, which is enclosed by deep valleys.

The airport's 2,380-square-meter terminal can accommodate up to 100 passengers.

But its real asset is the incredible Himalayan scenery -- a widescreen landscape captured in a series of stunning images by Indian photographer Rajiv Srivastava , who runs the website Imazin India

First commercial flights to the region

The airport will enter commercial passenger service when SpiceJet , one of the country's largest low-cost airlines launches two daily routes to Pakyong Airport (Pakyong-Kolkata and Pakyong-Guwahati) from October 4.

The Pakyong-Kolkata flight will take around 1.5 hours and the Pakyong-Guwahati route will take slightly longer than an hour.

The flights will offer some much-needed accessibility to the region. Before the opening of Pakyong, the nearest airport to Sikkim's state capital of Gangtok was Bagdogra, in West Bengal -- a five-hour drive.

Pakyong Airport is only 30 kilometers south of Gangtok.

Boosting tourism in Sikkim

It's hoped that the new airport will boost tourism in the region.

Bordered by Bhutan and Nepal, the northeastern state is known for its scenic Himalayan landscapes, boasting 28 mountain peaks, 21 glaciers and more than 200 lakes.

736bcffd65c14bab9ebb5a3a0d4fa70d	[]	2018-09-24 11:43:49+00:00	World's first Boeing 777 retires to Arizona air museum	https://www.cnn.com/	US	World's first Boeing 777 retires to Arizona air museum	1	"(CNN) — It's 24 years old this year, but the Boeing 777 airplane is still going strong -- it's one of the aviation manufacturer's best-selling models and is used by airlines across the world.

But, after nearly quarter of a century of flying, the first 777 has made its final flight -- to an aerospace museum in Arizona, where it'll see out its retirement as a top travel attraction.

The prototype 777-200, call sign B-HNL, rolled off the production line in 1994, eventually entering commercial service for Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific airline in 2000.

Over the years it's clocked up 20,519 flights for Cathay. That's a whopping 49,687 hours of flying time.

The venerable airplane was taken out of service in May 2018 and, after Boeing and Cathay agreed on the donation, it touched down in Tucson on September 19 to begin its new life at the Pima Air & Space Museum

Design feat

This is the original Boeing 777 airplane, now heading to the Pima Air & Space Museum in Arizona. Courtesu Cathay Pacific

Anouncing the deal, Boeing paid tribute to Cathay's role in developing the long-range airplane -- the world's largest twin-engine jet and one of the first to make use of fully digital fly-by-wire controls.

Cathay was one of the airlines that weighed in with design advice during the 777's development, alongside key international carriers including British Airways, All Nippon Airways, American Airlines, Qantas, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, Japan Airlines and United Airlines.

""Cathay Pacific has been instrumental in the tremendous success of the 777 program,"" Boeing's Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Kevin McAllister said in a statement. ""The airline contributed greatly to the airplane's original design and has been one of its biggest ambassadors ever since.""

It flew with Cathay Pacific from 2000 to May 2018. Courtesu Cathay Pacific

Boeing is currently working on a new edition of the 777 -- the 777-9 is scheduled to take off by 2019. The 777 series is widely acclaimed for bridging the capacity difference between smaller jets and the likes of Boeing's 747 jumbo.

""Our 777-200 aircraft have served us exceptionally well over the last two decades, and as we progressively retire these over the months ahead, we eagerly look forward to welcoming the state-of-the art 777-9 aircraft into our fleet from 2021,"" says Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Officer Rupert Hogg.

Hogg said the original 777 ""holds a very special place in the history of both our airline and that of commercial aviation.""

The Pima Air and Space Museum is an aviation buff's dream -- it hosts 150 airplanes inside and another 150 outdoors. This includes an original Wright Flyer as well as a 787 Dreamliner, plus military aircraft to boot.

The ""Instagrammification"" of cafes, art galleries and public spaces is a seemingly growing phenomenon -- after all, the more your business appears on social media feeds around the world, the more foot fall you're likely to see.

The popularity of spots such as the Museum of Ice Cream -- which caused a splash when it began dominating Manhattanite social media feeds in 2016 -- illustrates the phenomenon in action.

More cynical critics would argue these places risk becoming all aesthetic and no substance, but visitors to YND239-20 are keen to stress it's earned its place on the social media bucket list.

It helps that the owners have created a welcoming environment.

2de55cbe25bf4c26bbea43824f6dfec4	['Huynh Huu Phuoc', 'Eat Hoi An']	2018-09-24 23:02:50+00:00	On the hunt for Vietnam's best banh mi	https://www.cnn.com/	US	On the hunt for Vietnam's best banh mi	1	"(CNN) — Walking through Hoi An's Old Town, in central Vietnam , the omnipresent buzz of motorbikes fills the air.

Vendors push carts overloaded with ceramic vases and bowls. A pedicab slows down to offer a ride.

A woman touts custom-made tailoring and leather bags from a store, where a lush curtain of foliage falls from the rooftop.

But I am single-minded in my mission: To find the best banh mi in Hoi An -- and maybe even the world.

Banh mi basics

The king of sandwiches brings together several cultural traditions all in one crispy bun, namely a golden French baguette (introduced to Vietnam by French colonists in the late 19th century), pork pâté, Chinese char siu (barbecued pork), American hamburger meat, mayonnaise and a mix of Vietnamese herbs and chili sauces.

To assist in my quest, Huynh Huu Phuoc -- a Hoi An local and founder of Eat Hoi An street food tours and cooking classes -- has shortlisted a few of his top banh mi stalls and restaurants.

""If there's one thing to eat in Hoi An, I must say it's banh mi,"" Huynh tells CNN Travel . ""We have the best banh mi in the world.

""Eating is really part of our culture -- it's a fashion and a passion. You can eat banh mi all day. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, fast snack ... there's no right time to eat it.""

Huynh says the ""real Hoi An"" isn't in Old Town, so we hop on his motorcycle to ride northwest to Zone B.

""Locals don't really have any interest in Old Town, aside from work,"" he says.

""If you want to see and eat things that are authentic, you really have to go to Zone B. That's where most locals live -- and that's where you will mostly see the real life.""

We stop on a relatively quiet street, where he points to Phi Banh Mi: An open-air restaurant with red stools and stainless-steel tables.

""The banh mi here is created by Do Van Phi, a former chef at the Nam Hai (now the Four Seasons Nam Hai),"" says Huynh. ""He has so much knowledge of professional kitchens.""

Prepared in a matter of seconds, the banh mi comes topped with an abundance of herbs -- Vietnamese mint (which tastes like coriander), mint, spring onions, basil -- and a spicy helping of homemade chili sauce.

What makes this banh mi special is the roasted pork belly. ""The best part of the pig is the belly, but every pig has a different flavor and taste,"" says Huynh. ""A free-range pig will taste better -- and that's what he uses.""

Phi heads to the Central market every morning to collect fresh ingredients from the best vendors. ""He has really good pork belly -- they always save the best for him,"" says Huynh.

Madam Khanh - The Banh Mi Queen

After 45 years making banh mi, Madam Khanh passed the business to her children. Kate Springer/CNN

A well-known brick-and-mortar restaurant, Madam Khanh is nicknamed the Banh Mi Queen for good reason.

Now in her 90s, Nguyen Thi Loc set up her banh mi business in 1975 and ran it for 45 years -- nearly half her life. Though her daughter runs the show now, she often stops by in the mornings to help out.

""Her bread is really nice and she packs each sandwich with fresh herbs and homemade mayonnaise,"" says Huynh.

""She also makes homemade pâté from pig liver, seasoned with crushed shallot, lemongrass, pepper, salt, tiny bit of MSG inside.""

Since the second generation took over, Huynh says the banh mi have become more modern and, in some ways, more tailored for foreigners.

Huynh Huu Phuoc, Eat Hoi An “The most important thing about banh mi is the bread. It has to be fresh -- crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.”

The family introduced a bigger menu -- including vegetarian, beef and fish banh mi -- plus a slightly sweet sauce and added an omelet inside.

""The omelet is definitely not too traditional,"" says Huynh. ""We've never done that in the past, but this is kind of a new idea and people really liked it. It's like a fancy-style baguette. But I'd say it's sweet and less spicy than the traditional.""

La Banh Mi Sai Gon Tai Hoi An

La Banh Mi Sai Gon is Huynh's childhood favorite. Kate Springer/CNN

Located in western Hoi An, La Banh Mi Sai Gon Tai Hoi An is a nostalgic stop for Huynh.

""When I was a kid, I came here every day in the early morning to eat her banh mi,"" he recalls.

Born in Ho Chi Minh City, the owner of La Banh Mi Sai Gon Tai Hoi An, named Ta Thi Nghia, moved to Hoi An 20 years ago looking for new opportunities.

She quickly found a niche, setting up a roadside banh mi stall that Hoi An residents loved. Later, she expanded to a second location that her daughter runs.

It doesn't look like much other than a stall and a few plastic stools, but the family-run operation works to extract as much flavor as possible from each ingredient.

""Her banh mi is a little bit different, because it has southern tradition,"" says Huynh. ""She uses extra fatty rolled pork belly instead of char siu and plenty of green chili for heat. She also makes her mayonnaise -- using egg, oil and yogurt for a slightly sour taste.""

Huynh Huu Phuoc, Eat Hoi An “There's no rush here. They let (the pâté) cook nice and slowly.”

But the most memorable ingredient is the pâté. Off to the right, a wood-fired oven opens to reveal flames, licking a batch of fresh pork liver pâté.

""This is the correct way to cook pâté -- really, really slow with the open fire like this,"" says Huynh. ""After it's done, they let it burn a little bit. Then they bake it up, burning it again, to make the flavor much stronger. There's no rush here. They let it cook nice and slowly.""

Even though she's not cooking for foreigners, her banh mi does run a little on the sweet side. That's due to her Hoi Chi Minh City heritage.

""Her recipes are from the South, which is more influenced by the Khmer (Cambodian) culture,"" says Huynh. ""They eat more palm sugar and add it in the cooking, so food tends to be slightly sweeter.""

The most famous banh mi in the world, Banh Mi Phuong sells roughly 3,000-4,000 sandwiches per day.

""Seven years ago, a guy with a camera came by, ordered a bahn mi and said: 'This is the best banh mi in the world,'"" says Huynh. ""That was Anthony Bourdain. Afterwards, they got lots of international attention and became famous.""

Huynh says the hype -- and resulting lines out the door -- are well deserved.

Started by Truong Thi Phuong (aka Madam Phuong)'s parents, the business ""opened doors"" roughly 55 years ago. They ran it for about 25 years, before passing it on to their eldest daughter.

Madam Phuong, then a teacher, was totally overwhelmed. But her boyfriend Dang Ngọc Chau -- who had a highly coveted government police job at the time -- quit to help her.

He became the creative force behind the operation, taking over the kitchen (then in the Central Market) and refining the recipes.

""At that time, for a young man to leave such a good job and start working in a kitchen, it was looked down upon,"" says Huynh. ""He is really a hero of love.""

After winning over local eaters, the pair moved into a brick-and-mortar restaurant. They were very strategic about the location: right next to Hoi An's best bakery.

Huynh Huu Phuoc, Eat Hoi An “Seven years ago, a guy with a camera came by ... and said: 'This is the best banh mi in the world.' That was Anthony Bourdain.”

""The most important thing about banh mi is the bread. It has to be fresh -- crispy on the outside, soft on the inside,"" says Huynh. ""Their location is really smart. Now they have a steady stream of fresh baguettes.""

As for the taste? The restaurant has one of the largest menus with everything from vegetarian banh mi to bacon and beef.

In the traditional version, the baguette explodes with fresh ingredients, such as barbecued pork, spicy chili, a bundle of fresh herbs and yolky mayonnaise.

""Her husband is the brains in the kitchen,"" says Huynh. ""He has all the recipes, shows up at 4:30 a.m. to start preparation every day. He is the heart of this place.""

In business for about 30 years, the stall is run by Khuu Thi Lanh, who pumps out baguettes at lightning speed under the shade of a tin roof.

""This flavor is really the most authentic in Hoi An,"" says Huynh. ""They use the same bread as Madam Phuong's and homemade pâté, baked the traditional way in a lemongrass and shallot marinade.""

The baguette isn't too sweet, nor too saucy, and the bread tastes light and airy.

""The local people, when we eat a banh mi, we sit down at the stall on the stools,"" says Huynh.

""The first bite of a banh mi isn't ever really that good. But that second bite... mmm. That's when you start to get all the fillings, and the bread, in one bite.

Germany's known for its beer, but Rutz is probably better known for its wine, with its downstairs Weinbar a city favorite.

With two Michelin stars , Rutz delivers on the food, too, with ""expertly crafted dishes"" from chef Marco Müller and the team. They go for a light and balanced menu with locally sourced foods.

An idea of what you can expect: Vine wood and pine duck with Brussels sprouts; mussels and savory elderflowers; neck garden turnip and dashi.

Reinstoff

Closing soon: Reinstoff Berlin. Goetz Schleser

This stylish Mitte restaurant with two Michelin stars has become one of the top addresses in the city for ""neue deutsche kuche"" (new German cuisine) since opening in 2009.

A proponent of molecular cooking, chef Daniel Achilles splits his concoctions into two different menus: ""quite near"" and ""far away.""

The first features revamped regional dishes made with local ingredients. The second is for more experimental fare. Reservations essential. Act quickly -- the restaurant plans to close by the end of 2018.

Cookies Cream

Need a break from the meats (or don't eat meat at all)? Cookies Cream could be the place that serves just what you're seeking. This fine-dining restaurant with a clean, bright interior offers creative dishes from veggies and herbs.

The changing menu may feature starters such as leeks with black sesame. Main courses include the likes of corn porridge with coriander or celery with stained egg yolk. An herbal sorbet of oats and pink grapefruit gives you an idea of the desserts.

Just be warned: Entry to this one-star Michelin restaurant might not be easy to find and is via a door in an alleyway. But then finding your way through a warren of backstreets is such a Berlin thing to do.

Gaststätte Sophieneck

This cozy corner establishment -- once the site of a steam laundry -- is found in the Spandauer Vorstadt, an important center of Jewish life here before World War II. The area revitalized dramatically after reunification in the 1990s.

You'll find traditional German favorites on Sophieneck's rotating menu with mid-level prices. You might want to try their herring fillets if you like fish. Or try the Thüringer bratwurst with sauerkraut and fried potatoes. Don't forget a traditional apple strudel with whipped cream for a sweet ending.

There's an extensive beer, wine and spirits menu, too.

Flamingo Fresh Food Bar

The tourist's schedule can be a demanding one. With so many sights to see, sometimes you don't have time (or euros) to make a big production out of a meal. But you still want something good, maybe even healthy, to eat. That's where Flamingo Fresh Food Bar can help.

Around since 2010, the Flamingo focuses on fresh, regional ingredients, daily specials and homemade rotating soups (perfect if you're in Berlin when it's cold and cloudy).

Possible menu items when you're there: Couscous with red cabbage, tomato and chick pea soup, an avocado chili shrimp sandwich or coconut and vanilla rice pudding.

They also service breakfast and are close to Museum Island and other attractions.

Jones Ice Cream

Ice cream is a food group -- right?

At French patissier Gabrielle Jones' shop, you'll discover ice creams made in very small batches that are big on flavor. Among the more daring options: Cucumber and tonic sorbet, grapefruit and Earl Gray sorbet, whisky and pecan or rhubarb. Traditionalists with chocolate and strawberry aren't left out.

The shop in the largely residential Schöneberg district also has cookies.

02283e18b73c42c3848915f68189d844	[]	2018-09-26 10:27:59+00:00	Swiss village of Corippo to be turned into big hotel	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Swiss village of Corippo to be turned into big hotel	1	"(CNN) — The tiny mountain village of Corippo, arranged higgledy-piggledy on the green slopes of southern Switzerland's Verzasca valley, looks like something out of a fairytale.

But here, in what is Switzerland's smallest municipality, the citizens are facing a harsh reality.

What was once a thriving farming community of around 300 people has dwindled to just 12 residents, 11 of whom are over 65. Today, the only economic activity in the town is the local osteria, a rustic restaurant.

Here, in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, not far from Lacarno, Corippo's slate-roofed buildings, built from local Ticino granite, have remained largely untouched for centuries -- but it's now on the verge of becoming a ghost town.

Scattered hotel

However, all's not lost. A local foundation, Fondazione Corippo 1975 , has come up with a novel way to save the village: Corippo is set to become the country's first ""albergo diffuso,"" or scattered hotel.

Borrowing a model that's already proven successful in Italy , around 30 of the village's 70 buildings -- slate-roofed, built from local Ticino granite, and centuries-old -- are to to be converted into vacation cottages and hotel rooms.

It will, says Fabio Giacomazzi, an architect and president of the foundation, give visitors ""the chance to experience a very particular sojourn in a genuine rural village that remained practically the same since 1800.""

Aside from soaking up the atmosphere of an authentic Ticino village, guests will also be able to hike through the region, visit cultural sites and enjoy the local gastronomy.

""The idea emerged in the '90s,"" says Giacomazzi. ""The original idea to bring back permanent inhabitants was [no longer] feasible, because the buildings are too small and not directly inaccessible by car.""

And now, finally, things are starting to happen. The first cottage, the two-bedroom Casa Arcotti , opened to guests in late July 2018, while the hotel proper is scheduled to open Easter 2020.

The full three-stage restoration plan -- which comes with a price tag of around $6.5 million -- would see the osteria expanded and refurbished, in order to become not only the hotel's dining room but also a reception and meeting point.

The public squares in front of the town hall and church are to become open-air communal spaces, while a mill, a bakery and a chestnut-drying room are also slated for renovation.

There are also plans for landscaping, and the reintroduction of goat farming, as well as rye, hemp and chestnut trees.

What next?

The project is not yet fully funded, although the New York Times reported in August 2018 that $2.7 million had been raised so far, through public funding as well as bank loans.

There's been a lot of international interest in the project, with visitors keen to immerse themselves in Swiss village life. And in 2017, the project won the Swiss hotel and restaurant association Gastrosuisse's Hotel Innovation Award.

However, there are some question marks as to the feasibility of the project.

With such a small, aging population, there are relatively few people available to greet the visiting tourists. Concerns have been expressed about whether efforts should be focused on fixing infrastructure issues like poor water supply instead of attracting travelers.

Giacomazzi says the hotel concept could boost resident numbers.

""We hope that the hotel will offer the opportunity for a young family to undertake the management and to settle in Corippo together with some employees,"" he says.

The plan is also to attract craft traders to the area, to further revitalize the village.

Casa Arcotti is open to visitors. It sleeps four and costs CHF128 ($133) a night.

d4c3c57e4a584ae88388d192e08253ab	[]	2017-02-20 14:59:04+00:00	Brooklyn's coolest hotels and hottest hangouts	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Brooklyn's coolest hotels and hottest hangouts	1	"(CNN) — Never mind the image of the stereotypical hipster with a waxed handlebar mustache riding a vintage fixed-gear bicycle in Brooklyn.

While they still exist at the Mast Brothers chocolate factory at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, what's popping up alongside this New York borough's cocktail lounges and trendy restaurants is a new generation of hotels.

Whether catering to travelers from overseas, around the United States or just over the river in Manhattan, these high-design enclaves put guests right in the middle of the laid-back, artsy Brooklyn vibe.

It's a far cry from the area's manufacturing history, but the past is still front and center via original buildings; reclaimed wood, bricks and other material and subtle design touches that evoke the borough's centuries-old trade and manufacturing industry.

Here are eight of our favorite places to stay . All serve upscale craft cocktails on property and feature city views that are better than any postcard.

1. The Hoxton

The London-based brand opened its first outpost in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in September 2018. The neighborhood is as essential as any of the countless details that make the ""open house hotels"" unique. CEO and Founder Sharan Pasricha, over breakfast at the hotel restaurant Klein's, spoke excitedly about Brooklyn and what it means to open a British brand in the United States, in the most competitive hotel city in the world.

Pasricha likens The Hoxton in Williamsburg, a once-industrial neighborhood now known for its vibrant restaurant and bar scene and proximity to Manhattan (north-facing rooms serve up stunning views of the city's skyline), to his first venture in East London's Shoreditch, which he says was primed for gentrification.

The Hoxton in Brooklyn is in good company hotel-wise, but Pasricha isn't concerned. In the already-gentrified and impossibly hip Williamsburg, Pasricha hopes to reach locals and tourists alike. ""Our approach,"" he says ""is the uberlocal approach.""

Hotel guests are welcome in the generous common spaces of course, but The Hoxton hopes to be a regular spot for locals as well. This hotel wants not only to be a part of the lively Brooklyn scene but also a part of the community.

Do: Head to the hotel's rooftop bar for a beverage and a view. Plush chaise lounge chairs occupy one side of the roof, so if you're staying at the hotel and have started reading one of the books lining the shelf in your room, take it here for a change of scenery.

In inclement weather, tuck into one of the chairs in the expansive lobby space or check out the shop off the reception desk. Backyard, the hotel's outdoor bar and hangout space includes ping pong tables and local beers on tap.

Eat: An all-day menu at Klein's, helmed by Matthew Deliso, means you can enjoy a juicy burger at 10 a.m. or avocado toast at 10 p.m. The coffee bar off the main lobby offers up a tempting selection of pastries alongside its caffeinated beverage options. But when the lights go down, the best decision is to belly up to one of the hotel's bars and pick your poison.

The Williamsburg Shore contains top-shelf gin, sherry, lemon and prosecco bubbles while Pillow Talk is made with Bulleit bourbon, Velvet Falernum, plum bitters, chocolate mint and lemon.

2. Pod Brooklyn

Brooklyn, if counted as separate from the other four boroughs, would be the third-largest city in the United States. So with all that jostling for space, it seems logical that a microhotel would join the borough's roster.

The Pod Brooklyn opened in Williamsburg in late 2017, catering to the crowd of in-the-know travelers who wanted to base themselves in the city's coolest neighborhood.

While pod-style hotels are huge in space-starved cities such as Singapore and Hong Kong, the Pod Hotels group is focusing solely on the United States -- its other locations are in Washington, D.C., and across the river in Manhattan.

Besides being ideal for independent travelers who plan to spend more time out and about than watching TV in the room, Pod Brooklyn has devoted 10% of its rooms to accessibility, providing wheelchair-accessible showers and light-up buzzers for deaf and hard-of-hearing guests.

There are single and bunk-style rooms, making the hotel a solid option for groups of friends traveling together and pooling expenses.

Do: The Pod's commitment to green space means there's room for table tennis, board games or a picnic on one of four rooftops.

Eat: Ground-floor restaurant Clinton Hall has breakfast every day beginning at 7 a.m. (good news for jet-lagged travelers up with the sun), and the rest of the day has burgers paired with some of the borough's best craft beers.

Next door, the newly opened Butcher's Daughter has vegetarian and vegan-friendly bites, plus juices, coffee and absolutely no WiFi -- in case you need to unplug.

3. McCarren Hotel & Pool

The original gangster of the nouveau Brooklyn hotel scene, the relatively petite 5-year-old McCarren Hotel & Pool has changed with the times and begun adulting with the rest of the neighborhood.

The 64-room hotel recently introduced a Babies Who Brunch menu on Sundays, replete with a playroom, foam mats and Disney or Pixar movies for the kids and unlimited drinks for the adults.

The upscale but spare midcentury design in the lobby trickles up to the rooms, all outfitted with Eames-style shell rocking chairs, furry throw pillows and Frette linens on the beds. (Coffee-loving travelers dig the Nespresso machines in every suite.) The hotel's scene-y see-and-be-seen outdoor pool, framed by a bold, splashy mural by street artist LovebErto, is practically made for Instagram.

Do: With or without the kids, hit the pool from 7 to 11 am, before it opens to the public. A midday tour of the Brooklyn Brewery is only a block away. In the summertime, the hotel rents out bicycles to guests, along with maps of biking routes in the area.

Late in the evening, the party starts bumping on the McCarren Hotel's roof deck, where local DJs spin in genres from Brazilian music to dubstep as partygoers lounge on plush black-and-white-striped pillows and dance under a giant disco ball.

Eat: The hotel's restaurant, Oleanders, has a playful retro ""fern room"" aesthetic — evidenced by artist Yago Partal's portraits of zoo animals wearing headphones and hoodies — and focuses heavily on American comfort food. Specialties include the Southwest burger made with jalapeños and Woodford Reserve barbecue sauce, smoked gouda mac and cheese, and fried Brussels sprouts.

Every morning, there's a complimentary breakfast for guests in the lobby. Outside the hotel, walk a few blocks north to Greenpoint and brunch either indoors or alfresco at neighborhood bistro Five Leaves, which emphasizes local ingredients and sustainable house-cured arctic char and steamed mussels with saffron-coconut sauce.

4. Hilton Brooklyn

The Hilton Brooklyn, which opened in rapidly gentrifying Boerum Hill, takes its building's 1800s rope factory heritage very seriously: The carpeting in the hallways features a giant rope motif, the rooms' custom-made charcoal-sketch toile wallpaper depicts shipbuilding scenes, and the print of the navy-blue-and-white carpet in the rooms subtly recalls interlocking ropes. Vintage maps of Brooklyn dot the hallways and are incorporated into metalwork in the lobby of the 196-room ""boutique-style"" hotel.

Corporate travelers who are used to Hilton's usual perks will be happy to see there's an executive lounge and opportunities to earn rewards points, plus nice touches like Peter Thomas Roth toiletries and bowls of free fruit in the lobby.

(Other budget-friendly hotel options close by include the wellness-focused EVEN Hotel, from $199, which has workout equipment in each room and houses the basketball teams that play against the Brooklyn Nets, and the Holiday Inn, also from $199, whose French Korean restaurant, Brasserie Séoul, with its metal café chairs and Edison light bulbs, looks as though it was lifted right out of Williamsburg.)

Eat: Highly regarded Brooklyn chef Rob Newton heads up Black Walnut, the hotel's Southern Asian fusion restaurant, with a lineup featuring blistered shishito peppers, house-cultured whipped maple butter with warm Italian bread and classics like steak frites.

Also on the menu: red wine from local winery Brooklyn Oenology. If you venture outside the hotel for dinner, the classic old-school Italian restaurant Queen, in Brooklyn Heights, has been ladling out red sauce for 50-plus years.

Do: Catch a Brooklyn Nets or New York Islanders game or listen to performers like Future and Barbra Streisand at the Barclays Center, which is blissfully within walking distance (aka no fighting for a cab or Uber afterward). Even closer is the performing arts venue Brooklyn Academy of Music, for progressive theater performances, movie screenings and film series.

5. The Williamsburg Hotel

A towering Jenga-like structure built with reclaimed bricks, the Williamsburg Hotel is in the middle of a rolling opening, but two of five floors of rooms are available to book right now. Delightfully noticeable is the hotel's signature scent (think expensive fresh laundry), designed by Brooklyn-based company Apotheke, which also makes the hotel's toiletries.

The rooms strike a delicate balance between opulent and homey, with gold fixtures in the bathrooms, quilted leather headboards, gilded dark-wood wardrobes, velvet couches and bright knit blankets at the foot of the beds.

Eventually, egg-shaped chairs will hang from the rooms' balconies, ideal for taking in Manhattan views, or the perfect selfie. The hotel rolls out the red carpet for pets, providing each fluffball with a cushioned bed, a chew toy shaped like a trophy and stainless-steel food and water dishes.

Do: Soon the rooftop will be home to a pool and a tiny 20-person cocktail bar inside a water tower, currently under construction. For now, browse the afternoon away at nearby Artists & Fleas market, where local vendors sell their wares, including jewelry, vintage clothing and art prints, and Rough Trade indie record store, which hosts live acts such as Ryan Adams and Karen Elson.

Eat: The hotel's veggie-focused restaurant, Harvey, is slated to open this spring, but until then, chef Adam Leonti, who hand-mills his own flours, is whipping up bite-sized sweet and savory pastries for the hotel bar's afternoon high tea, which elevates routine to art form.

The selection of teas is curated by tea expert and Brooklynite Stefen Ramirez, so you can pair a blood orange linzer cookie with a Korean wild pear herbal tea, all while hanging out among young locals using the ample, cavernous space (and the free Wi-Fi) as their personal workspace. For dinner, down the street, family-run Italian restaurant Gran Sasso hand-makes pastas like Parmesan tortelli with squash, sage and crispy prosciutto.

6. The William Vale

Positioning itself as a brand-spanking new, resort-inspired hotel rather than an homage to Williamsburg's past, the monstrous 22-story, 183-room William Vale has eschewed design hallmarks like reclaimed wood and old-timey signage that scream ""Brooklyn!""

Instead, guests get art installations in the lobby and in the elevators, ultra-modern furniture and sweeping views of both Manhattan and Brooklyn through towering panes of glass. Oh, and ""The Bachelor."" Every room has a balcony.

Up top, the hotel's sprawling nightclubby cocktail bar, Westlight, hosts both locals and guests looking to take in the views and try original cocktails with names like the College Fund, made with three kinds of rum, tiki bitters, cream and root beer. Fun fact: The hotel is also home to retail space.

One newly announced tenant is Dylan Sprouse -- yes, of ""The Suite Life with Zack & Cody"" fame, who is now a master brewer. His mead-focused brewery, All-Wise Meadery, will churn out pints and bottles this summer.

Do: Weather permitting, swim in the hotel's 60-foot-long outdoor pool, or check out the hotel's original programming. It aims to bring hotel guests and the local community together for lectures, live performances and wellness classes, including a monthly meditation event centered around the full moon and an upcoming live, interactive prank-calling show called ""Prank You.""

Eat: Leuca, the hotel's Southern Italian restaurant run by chef Andrew Carmellini, with its signature squid ink spaghetti, has been on local restaurant geeks' hot list ever since it opened in November. Sharing the Sophia Loren affogato sundae for two is an event all by itself.

When the weather is warmer, the hotel's Mister Dips airstream food truck parks on the hotel's public green space and sells burgers, fries and ice cream. Off property, having brunch at the Southern comfort food restaurant Brooklyn Star is practically a rite of passage for locals, especially when you order the fried chicken and waffles with apple butter and fresh grapefruit.

7. Wythe Hotel

Retrofitted into a former cooperage that was built in 1901, the Wythe Hotel has been doing its vintage-meets-modern thing since 2012.

It still retains the building's original pine beams and factory windows but infuses the space with of-the-moment accoutrements, including framed modern art in the lobby and eco-friendly toiletries by local purveyor Goldie's. The hotel's 70 rooms carry the same industrial but homey vibe, with radiant-heat concrete flooring, beds made from reclaimed ceiling timbers, and picture-perfect views of Manhattan in premium rooms.

Adding to the cool-kid factor is the hotel's latest project, a live-streaming pop-up radio lounge in the lobby featuring performances and discussions with authors, activists, fashion designers, musicians and other creative types. When it's not a recording studio, the lobby functions as a sitting room-cum-library or a retail shop, depending on programming.

Do: Right across the street from the Wythe is Brooklyn Bowl, a large, high-tech bowling alley that doubles as an event space for live music — among other musical acts, DJ Questlove has a Thursday night residency.

Eat: A destination in itself, the hotel's restaurant, Reynard, from Brooklyn restaurateur Andrew Tarlow, is a local favorite with an ever-changing seasonal menu, but they Reynard burger, made with gruyere and and caramelized onions, is a classic.

Upstairs, The Ides Bar serves classic cocktails and small plates like lobster sliders, paired with views of Manhattan from both inside the bar and out on the roof deck. Want a classic Brooklyn pie? You can't go wrong with Paulie Gee's a few blocks north in Greenpoint, which tops pizzas with anything-but-the-usual ingredients like sake reductions and hot honey.

Wythe Hotel , 80 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, +1 718-460-8000

8. 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge

A sage blessing ceremony kicked off the opening of the five-star 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge in mid-February as the first guests checked in to the massive warehouse-like space in Dumbo, right by the Brooklyn Bridge.

The 10-story nature-focused hotel has plenty of nods to the location's manufacturing heritage, the sea, and the bridge itself everywhere on the property. It includes the slim metal rods of the entrance's grand staircase, intended as an ode to the bridge; an art installation in the lobby featuring 6,000 pounds of rope-bound obsidian rocks; and the elevator, whose rough wooden planks are meant to evoke a shipping container.

In keeping with the 1 Hotels brand's eco-friendly mission, more than half of the materials used in the hotel's design are local or reclaimed, including pine beams from the former Domino Sugar factory in Williamsburg. Standing beside the windows inside one of the 194 rooms — all outfitted in neutral tones, wood, rope, leather, marble and live greenery — the Brooklyn Bridge looks close enough to touch.

Do: Walking across the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan is a free and convenient must-do. When the weather heats up, One˚15 Brooklyn Marina offers sailing classes and kayaking. Also nearby is famous Gleason's Gym, known as the boxing gym where Muhammad Ali trained for his fight with Sonny Liston, which often hosts boxing shows and clinics.

Closer to home, the hotel's plunge pool occupies a corner of the rooftop, along with fire pits and seating made from reclaimed railroad wood, an ideal place to admire downtown Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty on nearby Liberty Island. The hotel's holistic Bamford Haybarn Spa will open this fall.

Eat: The hotel is still working on partnering with restaurants to open within the space. Until then, Neighbors, the café next to the lobby, sells locally made grab-and-go (or stay) drinks and bites, such as cookies from Crown Heights baker Butter & Scotch and single-origin Dominican chocolate from Cacao Prieto in Red Hook. For a glass of wine and a bowl of pasta, rustic Sardinian restaurant River Deli is a promenade stroll away."	https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F170217164615-brooklyn-hotels-wythe-reynard-super-tease.jpg
a7f644cb11d1416e88be1534d5894674	['Faith Karimi', 'Idris Muktar']	2018-09-23 00:00:00	Survivor describes the terror when a ferry capsized in Tanzania, killing 224 people	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Survivor describes the terror when a ferry capsized in Tanzania, killing 224 people	1	"(CNN) A man who survived a ferry capsizing in Tanzania described the harrowing ordeal that left six of his relatives dead and the East African nation mourning 224 people killed.

Ochori Burana said the ferry was overcrowded with hundreds of people headed to a popular open air market when it capsized Thursday on Lake Victoria.

Moments before the tragedy, the ferry made a sharp turn and tipped to one side, throwing people and cargo into the frigid water, Burana told the state-run Tanzania Broadcasting Corp.

Rescuers retrieve a body Friday from the water near Ukara Island on Lake Victoria in Tanzania.

He jumped out just before it went down and clutched on to a car tire swaying in the waters. He used it to stay afloat for about 15 minutes until fishermen rescued him, he said.

Burana said he lost six relatives who were traveling with him.

As the nation mourned, relatives dug mass graves as colorful coffins lined the shores. Family members awaited word on their loved ones, some weeping as crews removed bodies from the waters.

Volunteers arrange the coffins of passengers killed when the ferry capsized.

Most of the remains have been identified and will be buried in one place, Transport Minister Isack Kamwele told CNN.

""Till this morning we have been able to pull out 223 bodies out of the sea,"" he said Sunday. ""The exercise is still going on, and at the moment we are trying to fix apparatus to lift the ferry out (onto) land."" Later on Sunday he said the number had risen to 224.

Ferry's captain arrested

The captain of the overloaded ferry has been arrested, and all its operators will be detained for questioning, President John Magufuli said.

In an address Friday, Magufuli said the captain left the ferry's steering in the hands of an untrained person. Initial reports indicated that overloading contributed to the deadly disaster, but an investigation will determine the exact cause, the Tanzanian leader said.

The total number killed might never be known because it's unclear how many people were aboard the overcrowded ferry. Officials said the vessel had a capacity for 100 people but was carrying an estimated 400 instead.

The ferry was traveling from Bugolora to Ukara Island when it capsized about 650 feet from its destination.

Engineer rescued after 48 hours

Rescuers have struggled to pull out bodies from the lake. Since the ferry overturned with both luggage and people, crews had to remove cargo to get to the bodies, the transport minister said.

An engineer from the ferry was among the people rescued Saturday, Tanzania Broadcasting reported. He was among eight engineers aboard the ferry when it capsized, and he had locked himself inside an engine room since Thursday.

'He ... said he was in trouble'

Officials said the ferry had a capacity of about 100, but an estimated 400 people were on board.

Fisherman Maulid Musa said he received a phone call from a friend aboard the ferry moments before it capsized.

""He called me and said he was in trouble,"" Musa told The Citizen newspaper. ""That the boat he was traveling in was about to sink. I tried to ask him what was happening. He said all the passengers on board had moved to one side of the boat. Then the phone went off.""

Musa said he tried to rush to the scene to help, but there were no boats going there. He found out Friday his friend had died.

Navy spokesman Ayo Olugbode said several agencies are working on a joint search operation to locate the crew kidnapped Saturday.

They were aboard t he Swiss-owned MV Glarus carrying wheat while sailing from Lagos to Port Harcourt in southern Nigeria.

The crew members are nationals of Philippines, Slovenia, Ukraine, Romania, Croatia, and Bosnia, the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency said in a statement released to Reuters news agency.

The pirates reportedly struck about 45 nautical miles south-southwest of Bonny Island.

Preliminary investigations into Saturday's incident show the crew members had been taken to land, Olugbode said.

""We are working with many agencies including with Interpol on search and rescue operations on this case,"" Olugbode said.

The spokesman said he had no information on any ransom demands.

""We are speaking with the remaining crew members to know what measures were taken during the attack. For instance, the captain and the ship's crew are to go into the citadel of the ship when they are being attacked. We want to know if all these steps were taken during the incident,"" Olugbode told CNN.

Although maritime piracy and armed robbery incidents dropped to a 22-year-low last year, danger still persists to vessels plying routes in the Gulf of Guinea, especially off Nigeria, the International Maritime Bureau (IMO) said in a recent report

According to the non-profit devoted to fighting crime at sea, 10 incidents of kidnapping involving 65 crew members were reported in or around Nigerian waters in 2017.

In February, 22 Indian nationals were taken hostage on an oil vessel off the coast of West Africa.

67fb52d4fadc41b2a1536baa74b3ff81	['Kara Fox', 'Cnn Video Edward Kiernan']	2018-09-22 00:00:00	Rwandan imprisoned opposition leader to go on trial as another walks free -- for now	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Rwandan imprisoned opposition leader to go on trial as another walks free -- for now	1	"CNN -- Rwandan President Paul Kagame shocked many in his country and around the world last week when he granted more than 2,000 prisoners an unexpected pardon.

But while the President was announcing the move in parliament to ""rehabilitate our citizens,"" Diane Rwigara, the sole female challenger in last year's election that Kagame won with almost 99% of the vote, languished in jail, awaiting her fate in court.

Rwigara, a 37-year-old accountant and fierce critic of Kagame, launched her election bid three months ahead of the August 2017 presidential vote.

Shortly after she began her presidential campaign, Rwigara was disqualified by electoral authorities. They claimed she exaggerated the number of signatures needed to qualify and accused her of submitting the names of dead people, charges Rwigara denies.

Her supporters say all the charges are politically motivated and highlight a lack of political and social freedoms under Kagame.

As Rwigara prepares to hear her fate in court on Monday, veteran watchers of Rwandan politics say she could follow in the footsteps of a previous opposition politician who dared to challenge Kagame.

Arrest after exile

Victoire Ingabire, the 49-year-old leader of the opposition FDU-Inkingi party, was one of the 2,140 prisoners released last Saturday after serving eight years of her 15-year sentence.

In 2010 Ingabire returned to Rwanda from the Netherlands, where she was living in exile, to contest the presidential election. But she soon ran into problems with the government over comments she made in relation to the country's 1994 genocide and was arrested on charges that included collaborating with a terrorist organization and ""genocide ideology."" She was initially handed an eight-year prison sentence that was later extended to 15 years.

Rwandan opposition leader Victoire Ingabire leaves Nyarugenge prison on early release on September 15, 2018. She was one of 2,140 prisoners released the same day on a presidential pardon.

Ingabire has long said her sentence was a result of her work as a prominent government critic and that the charges effectively criminalized her freedom of expression. International organizations such as Amnesty International and a 2017 African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights ruling have supported those views.

Kagame won the 2010 election with 93% of the vote. By the time the next presidential election came around in 2017, Rwigara had entered the political scene seeking to run as an independent candidate after she was disqualified as a candidate.

Rwigara launched the People Salvation Movement (Itabaza), an activist group to ""encourage Rwandans to hold their government accountable."" Shortly after its inception, she was arrested on charges of incitement and fraud. Rwigara's mother Adeline was also arrested on charges of discrimination and sectarian practices and inciting insurrection.

Although Rwigara was unconnected with any political party or Ingabire herself, the parallels between the two women's cases are clear, according to Phil Clark, a political scientist at SOAS University of London who has studied Rwanda for nearly 20 years.

""Really we're seeing the exact same thing with Rwigara as we saw with Ingabire in terms of the targeting of a women political opponent,"" he told CNN.

""The government will often lock up political opponents at the height of their powers and then strategically release them once they feel that they or their party has been neutralized,"" Clark said.

Fears of retribution

This summer, CNN traveled to Kigali and spoke with Rwigara's family and supporters who allege harassment, censorship and threats of violence.

A handful of Rwigara's supporters CNN spoke to said they stopped visiting Rwigara and her mother in prison earlier this year, fearful of violent retribution. Safety remains some supporters' primary concern, with some taking the added measure of moving from house to house each night to avoid surveillance, according to two supporters.

Inside a Kigali safehouse where two of Rwigara's supporters share their stories.

Rwanda's Office of the President, National Police and the RPF have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for comment.

Some of Rwigara's supporters said this week that their situation continues to deteriorate and their lives remain in danger.

One of those supporters, Honore -- whose name has been changed for his safety -- says he hasn't visited the Rwigaras since his phone and laptop were confiscated by authorities who, he said, beat him and told him: ""I will kill you if you continue to do this.""

Honore fled Rwanda in June, fearful of imprisonment or lethal violence. However, he recently returned to the capital Kigali, where he is slowly continuing to drum up support for Rwigara's People Salvation Movement from the shadows.

He worries continuously about his security and says he struggles to support himself and his young family. Although he hopes the Rwigaras will be freed following their trial -- noting the unexpected release of Ingabire last week -- he feels the balance is tipped in favor of the government.

""It is not a fair trial, it is the government's game,"" Honore told CNN via text message on Friday.

""The government needs their property only, it doesn't need judgment,"" referring to the Rwanda's Revenue Authority's seizure of the Rwigara family's assets, estimated at more than 1.7 billion Rwandan francs (approximately $1.9 million).

""I think that when you want to be president in Rwanda, he (Kagame) considers you to be as the enemy -- he doesn't want anyone else to become president when he is alive,"" Honore added of the lack of political freedom.

Even if the Rwigaras are released from jail, they won't be afforded true freedom, Honore said, again pointing to Ingabire.

Immediately after she was freed from jail, Ingabire urged the Rwandan government to open the country's political landscape and asked them to free all other political prisoners, including nine members of her own political party.

Most notably, she called for Rwigara's release.

Ominous warning

Ingabire's freedom of movement -- and speech -- could be short lived.

On Wednesday, in his address to the incoming parliament, Kagame warned that his presidential pardon should not be misinterpreted as giving into international pressure to free political prisoners, but rather a decision to ""enable them to contribute to our country.""

""Just recently when we pardoned many people, including the so-called politicians who are more popular outside the country than they are here, it was in the same spirit. It is not the first time we have done this,"" Kagame said, referencing Ingabire by all but name.

""Then you see people saying 'I did not ask for mercy, they released us because of pressure.' Pressure here? If you continue believing that, don't be shocked if you go back to jail,"" Kagame warned.

The Rwandan President was referring to an interview Ingabire gave to the BBC Gahuzamiryango service, also posted to her official Facebook page. Ingabire said she did not ask to be released for crimes she maintained she hadn't committed.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame campaigns during the 2017 presidential election.

Kagame has sent a clear message to Ingabire, according to Phil Clark: keep your head down.

""I think the government's view is, 'we can let her out but she effectively needs to stop being any kind of serious political actor ... but if she tries to re energize her political campaign, or call for political changes like she has in the past, then she might again face some government sanction.'""

As Ingabire faces some tough choices in her new-found ""freedom,"" Diana Rwigara and her mother will stand trial on Monday, hoping for the best.

While some supporters remain skeptical that the Rwigaras will be given a fair trial, Clark believes that changes seen in Rwanda over the last year could signal that the outcome of the case is uncertain.

Diane Rwigara at her home in Kigali, prior to her September 2017 arrest.

""There's a default expectation in the international community that Rwandan courts will just toe the political line and give the government everything that it wants in high-profile cases,"" Clark said.

Although ""everything in Rwigara's case up until now has suggested that the courts aren't going to rattle the political establishment,"" the courts have been displaying an ""important degree of independence from the ruling party even in the last year,"" Clark said.

One example: The Supreme Court's admission of a 2015 challenge to a constitutional amendment, which allowed Kagame to run for a third term. The Court eventually ruled that Kagame could run for a third term, clearing the way for him to potentially stay in power until 2034.

And this year, in a high profile case, the court dropped nearly all of the charges against a man charged with genocide who had been extradited from the US.

How that judicial independence will play out with the Rwigaras' case will be seen on Monday. But regardless of the trial's outcome, their future, like many Rwandans, still appears to rest in Kagame's hands."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180823164231-01-rwanda-politics-video-super-tease.jpg

The human rights organization said it had recorded 260 security incidents , including cases of kidnapping of civilians and violence between Cameroon's soldiers and armed Anglophone separatists, since January.

Amnesty International said it authenticated two videos it received last week showing graphic images of a beheaded Cameroonian security officer. The videos also captured a man who said he belonged to Ambazonia Liberation Forces, a separatist group demanding a secession from the West African country.

CNN has not independently authenticated the videos and is unable to immediately reach Ambazonia Liberation Forces for comment.

Since 2016, at least 160 soldiers have been killed by armed separatists calling for independence from the French-speaking regions of Cameroon, according to Amnesty International.

Separatist fighters unleashed attacks on a group of soldiers in the city of Buea, in southwest Cameroon. in September, Amnesty International said.

The ""brutal attacks"" against civilians and security forces are proof of the ""horrific escalation of violence"" in Cameroon's volatile Anglophone provinces, Amnesty International said.

""The situation in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon is becoming increasingly desperate with no one spared from the violence which is spiraling out of control,"" said Samira Daoud, Amnesty International deputy director for West and Central Africa, in a statement

People in Cameroon's two Anglophone provinces, who make up 20% of the country's population, have long had grievances against the largely Francophone central government.

They say they have been marginalized by the country's French-dominated educational and legal systems, which can be traced to Cameroon's post-colonial era.

But tension deteriorated into full blown crisis last year after protests in Anglophone regions turned violent, with some calling for secession.

The Cameroon government has been accused of using its military to crack down on armed separatists and killing English speakers

Amnesty International alleged seven students and a head teacher were kidnapped by armed separatists from their school in the town of Bafut, in the northwest part of Cameroon, in September.

The hostages were ""tortured and seriously injured"" by their kidnappers before their release, the human rights group said.

""By also attacking and kidnapping students and teachers, we have reasons to believe many other lives of ordinary people are now at risk with the violence carried out by some members of the armed separatists groups. This must immediately stop,"" Daoud said.

Daoud warned there could be an upsurge in attacks by armed separatists, who he said have threatened to disrupt elections.

He called on the government to ""act immediately"" while also restoring peace in its English-speaking provinces.

""Violence will only fuel further incidents, crimes and untold suffering. The government must act immediately against this in an attempt to restore peace in the Anglophone regions,"" Daoud said."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161213064522-01-cameroon-protests-1213-super-tease.jpg

In the other is the real President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, who -- like many of Africa's former revolutionaries -- has clung to power for decades, amid growing calls for him to step down.

Museveni, 73, has ruled the east African nation with an iron fist since he took power in 1986 and is not known to be soft on his opponents; he has seen off many of them in his 32-year rule.

But some commentators are saying that Wine -- with his musical and political clout as well as a solid youth base -- is the real challenger to Museveni's throne.

""Bobi Wine poses a real threat to Museveni, more so in consideration that young Ugandans, many of whom are unemployed, constitute a huge percentage of the active electorate,"" says Jimmy Spire Ssentongo, an Associate Dean at Uganda Martyrs University.

""Given the widespread public desperation in Uganda, all many people want is a person who shows the potential of removing Museveni. All else is secondary,"" he said in an interview with The Conversation

Before he was Bobi Wine, the musician was known as Robert Kyagulanyi. He grew up in the slums of Uganda, raised by a single mother, but turned to music as a way out of grinding poverty.

His upbeat dancehall music style and catchy lyrics dominated airwaves and clubs across East Africa from the early 2000s.

Singing frequently in his native Luganda, the songs contained strong messages, often railing against social injustice in the country.

He called on the citizenry to ""rise up and raise their voices"" to challenge oppression.

""Don't shy away from working for Uganda, because it is your own country, even if your boss was not your choice. Just play your part, because this is your country,"" he sang in one of his hits, "" Situka.

With such politically conscious lyrics, a career in politics was, perhaps, inevitable.

In 2017, he stood for Parliament as an independent, campaigning on the catchphrase : ""Since Parliament has failed to come to the ghetto, then we shall bring the ghetto to Parliament.""

He was elected by a landslide and has since proved to be a thorn in Museveni's side, pitching his tent with opposition legislators and continuing to make music, mostly critical of the President's long-term rule.

His popularity has not gone unnoticed by the government.

Some of his songs, including ""Freedom,"" have been banned in the country.

""See our leaders become misleaders,"" Wine sang. ""And see our mentors become tormentors. Freedom fighters become dictators. They look upon the youth and say we're destructors.""

Bobi Wine, 36, was a toddler when Museveni came to power.

A former defense minister, Museveni had formed a political party that would go on to overthrow the brutal Idi Amin dictatorship in 1979.

Uganda has one of the youngest populations in the world; more than three-quarters of the country's 35.6 million people are below the age of 30.

According to the International Labor Organization , young people form 83% of the unemployed in Uganda.

Many are frustrated and long for opportunities that will lift them out of poverty.

President for life?

Once revered for unseating one of Africa's most brutal leaders, Museveni himself now runs the risk of becoming a dictator.

He has changed the constitution twice to extend his stay in office. In 2005, legislators removed presidential term limits to allow him to stand for elections.

A bill was also passed last year eliminating constitutional limits on anyone serving as president past the age of 75, paving the way for Museveni to become president for life.

When it was debated in Parliament, Wine joined opposition MPs to shut down the law.

He said in a Facebook post that it was time for Museveni to release his firm grip over the nation.

""Ugandans made it clear long ago that they are opposed to a life presidency,"" he wrote. ""They don't want the constitution tampered with in any way.""

Arguments during the presidential age limit debate descended into chaos as lawmakers exchanged punches and threw chairs at each other in Parliament.

The amendment also sparked protests among students and activists.

#FreeBobiWine

Wine has used his star power and political office to galvanize Uganda's youth to take action against unpopular policies.

When the President introduced a controversial social media tax earlier this year, Wine led a protest march to Uganda's Parliament to demand a review.

However, he is not without controversy. In 2014, the pop star was forced to cancel a UK tour after he was denied entry into Britain following protests from gay activists who accused him of promoting homophobic lyrics, according to the UK Guardian

He later wrote: ""I am personally not out to threaten the life of any individual based on their sexual orientation, I just do not agree with them (homosexuals),"" he said. ""This is my opinion and happens to be that of 99% of Ugandans,"" the newspaper reported.

Following his arrest and alleged torture, Wine has gained global prominence and sparked an international protest movement.

The lawmaker was arrested on August 15 alongside opposition MPs after rioting broke out between rival parties ahead of a local parliamentary election.

Wine said on Twitter that his driver was shot dead. Police said Museveni's car was attacked in the aftermath of the violence.

The public has reacted to the recent events with outrage and anger, most of it channeled through social media.

From Tokyo to Washington, activists and fans joined the #FreeBobiWine hashtag online and took to the streets to demand the singer's release.

Activists and civil society groups marched to the Ugandan embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, on August 23 to protest against Wine's detention.

Influential figures in the music industry, including Chris Martin, Angelique Kidjo, Damon Albarn and others, also joined the campaign.

Thousands of Kenyans marched to the country's Parliament and the Ugandan embassy in Nairobi to hand over a petition for the singer's release.

'A brutal regime'

Kampala's Mayor, Erias Lukwago, told CNN Wine's arrest has exposed Museveni's ""brutal regime.""

""The level of injustice in Uganda is too much; this brutal regime wants to suppress opposing voices. But they must know that Ugandans are angry, and they will no longer tolerate any form of oppression,"" Lukwago, who is also on Wine's legal team, said.

The singer, now facing treason charges, was taken into military detention following his arrest. He posted a lengthy statement Monday detailing the physical abuse he says he suffered at the hands of the military during and after his arrest last month.

Wine, who is seeking treatment in the United States, claims to have been beaten with an iron bar, punched, kicked, hit with pistol butts and had his ears pulled with ""something like pliers.""

""After some time, I could almost no longer feel the pain. I could only hear what they were doing from afar. My cries and pleas went unheeded. The things they were speaking to me all this while, I cannot reproduce here. Up to now, I cannot understand how these soldiers who I probably had never met before in person could hate me so much,"" Wine says in the statement.

Safely arrived in the US where I'll be receiving specialised treatment following the brutal torture at the hands of SFC soldiers. We thank the world for standing with us. I will soon tell you what exactly happened to me since 13th August and what is next. #peoplepower Power pic.twitter.com/0IcA3wUAQd — BOBI WINE (@HEBobiwine) September 1, 2018

Police spokesman Patrick Onyango told CNN the allegations are being investigated.

""There are allegations -- they are alleging that they were tortured by security forces. There is already a case file open to investigating their allegations of torture, so the allegations of torture has also to be proven by medical examinations. I cannot believe what they're saying unless the medical personnel confirm to us that they were indeed tortured. Until the medical team from the government ascertain or confirms to us that they were tortured that's when I can say they were,"" he said.

Museveni also took to his blog and social media to dismiss the torture allegations as ""fake news.""

He accused Wine and the arrested MPs of intimidating voters.

""Anybody who is a friend of the young politicians like Bobi Wine should advise them that shortcuts like cheating, importing voters, intimidating the voters of the other side, ballot stuffing... will lead them and Uganda to doom,"" Museveni said.

Clinging to power

While much of the developed world embraces the energy of youth in leadership positions, it is not often the case in Africa.

From Uganda to Cameroon, many of the continent's leaders are aging and clinging to power while their countries struggle to keep pace with global developments.

Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe was forced to relinquish power in 2017 after 37 years of autocratic rule. The 94-year-old had ruled the country since its independence in 1980.

Cameroon's Paul Biya, 85, has been President since 1982 and plans to stand again for election in October, amid spiraling violence and alleged human rights abuses in the country.

It is no wonder young politicians like Wine attract a strong and loyal following when they go up against these regimes.

But Wine is quick to reject notions that he is a messianic figure who will topple Museveni's long-standing regime.

I have said it before that any party that tells you that it can single handedly liberate Uganda is a jocker.

During his arrest and detention in August , Wine says he was beaten with an iron bar, punched, kicked, hit with pistol butts and had his ears pulled with ""something like pliers.""

""After some time, I could almost no longer feel the pain. I could only hear what they were doing from a far. My cries and pleas went unheeded. The things they were speaking to me all this while, I cannot reproduce here. Up to now, I cannot understand how these soldiers who I probably had never met before in person could hate me so much,"" Wine said in the statement.

Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is an MP and the leader of a youth movement that has rattled the regime of President Yoweri Museveni.

Uganda's ministers of internal affairs, defense and security will hold a press conference Tuesday to address allegations of torture by security forces, deputy national police spokesperson Patrick Onyango said Monday. Museveni previously dismissed allegations that Wine and other opposition politicians were tortured.

The Facebook post is the first detailed statement Wine has made since he arrived in the United States over the weekend. Wine came to the US for medical treatment following ""brutal torture"" at the hands of Uganda's Special Forces Command, he said in a tweet Saturday upon arriving. CNN has reached out to Uganda's SFC for comment.

""We thank the world for standing with us,"" Wine said in Saturday's tweet.

Wine was first arrested by the military on August 15 after rioting broke out between rival parties ahead of a local parliamentary election in the Arua municipality. He has been charged with treason for allegedly trying to stone Museveni's convoy. Another 32 opposition politicians have also been charged.

In his Facebook post, Wine said SFC soldiers stormed a hotel where he was staying on August 13 and fatally shot one of his team members. Wine locked himself in a room and listened as soldiers shouted at people and beat them up while searching for him.

""In the wee hours of the morning, the soldiers started breaking doors of the different hotel rooms. With rage, they broke doors, and I knew they would soon come to my room,"" he said.

Eventually, a soldier beat down his door with an iron bar and another ordered him to his knees at gunpoint, Wine said.

""I put my hands up and just before my knees could reach the floor, the soldier who broke into the room used the same iron bar to hit me. He aimed it at my head and I put up my hand in defence so he hit my arm. The second blow came straight to my head on the side of my right eye. He hit me with this iron bar and I fell down. In no minute, all these guys were on me -- each one looking for the best place to hurt. I can't tell how many they were but they were quite a number,"" he said.

""They beat me, punched me, and kicked me with their boots. No part of my body was spared. They hit my eyes, mouth and nose. They hit my elbows and my knees. Those guys are heartless!""

They brought him to a car and continued to torture him until he lost consciousness, he said. ""They pulled my manhood and squeezed my testicles while punching me with objects I didn't see. They pulled off my shoes and took my wallet, phone and the money I had. As soon as the shoes were off, they started hitting my ankles with pistol butts. I groaned in pain and they ordered me to stop making noise for them. They used something like pliers to pull my ears,"" he said,

He regained consciousness in a small room with his legs and hands tied together with tight cuffs, bleeding from the nose and ears, he said. Two soldiers entered the room and one of them offered a tearful apology, he said.

From there, he says he was transported to military barracks in northern Uganda, where he was drugged and forced to sign a written statement at the Gulu Police Station, the contents of which he hardly recalls, he said. Then, he was moved to military barracks in Makindye, where he was able to see his wife, lawyers and representatives from the Uganda Human Rights Commission, who made a report of his condition, he said.

""I will never forget the atmosphere in that room -- people started crying upon setting eyes on me. At that point, I could not sit, walk or even stand by myself. I was still swollen and spoke with great difficulty due to chest pains,"" he said.

On that day, he said he learned that he was due in court on August 23 after being ""framed"" on weapons charges, and received constant medical attention. ""It was clear they wanted me to appear in better shape at the next time of my court appearance and they did everything possible to achieve that.""

The weapons charge was withdrawn and he was freed on bail August 27 , paving the way for his departure to the United States.

Wine attempted to travel to the United States on Thursday but was prevented from boarding his flight, one of his attorneys, Erias Lukwago, told CNN. He was taken away in a police vehicle to a government-owned hospital in the capital of Kampala with limited access to his family, the lawyer said. On Friday, Uganda's Police Force said it had prevented Wine from traveling in order to give him a medical checkup to investigate allegations that he was tortured.

""The Uganda Police have violently blocked Hon Bobi Wine from traveling outside of the country in spite of the court declining to do so when being released on bail earlier in the week. This is absurd to say the least,"" lawyer Nicholas Opiyo said on Twitter.

Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, was first arrested by the military on August 15 after rioting broke out between rival parties ahead of a local parliamentary election.

He has been in and out of court since then, most recently having been freed on bail Monday.

Wine was on his way out of the country to seek medical treatment in the United States and was prevented from boarding a flight at around 8 p.m. local time, according to his legal team.

He was then whisked away in a police vehicle to a government-owned hospital in the city with limited access to his family, one of his attorneys, Erias Lukwago, told CNN.

Lukwago said the arrest was a ""violation"" of his rights and said the lawmaker has not recovered from injuries he allegedly sustained while in military detention.

""The court did not seize his passport, despite prayers by the state to do so. This means Wine is free to travel out of the country for any reason. He can also seek medical attention wherever he feels better,"" Lukwago told CNN.

Another of his attorneys, Robert Amsterdam alleged Uganda's special forces tortured the MP in the ambulance that took him to the hospital, while a doctor watched.

""He is seriously ill... he was brutally beaten and tortured last weekend and last night he was beaten again at the instructions of a senior officer of Ugandan special forces who told the occupants of the police van to ""teach him a lesson"", his words, whereupon they set upon him again, turned the lights off and beat him in front of a doctor,"" Amsterdam told CNN.

Police also prevented another MP Francis Zaake from boarding a flight to India Thursday, saying he was a suspect in criminal case.

Ugandan Police Deputy spokesman Patrick Onyango denied the MP's were tortured in custody and accused them of attempting to flee the country.

""He (Wine) was put in an ambulance well equipped with all the equipment you can think of, so they were really basically handled in a professional way,"" Onyango told CNN.

""They were trying to go against the procedure. I cannot believe what they're saying, until the medical team from the government ascertain or confirms to us that they were tortured that's when I can say they were,"" he added.

Museveni recently took to social media to dismiss allegations that Wine and other opposition MPs were tortured in detention.

Made, 27, is a housewife who looks after their 10-month-old baby, while Zou, 43, is a fishing captain and the family breadwinner.

But in China, they have become an online sensation.

The couple began live-streaming funny skits of their home life on Chinese social media platform, Kuaishou, in February. They now have 120,000 followers.

Sandra Made and Zou Qianshun say they are one of five Chinese-African couples in their town in Liaoning province, China.

Made says their videos are popular because people are not used to seeing an African woman with a Chinese man.

""Everyone loves Sandra and thinks she's outgoing,"" says Zou. The couple makes about 5,000 yuan ($727) a month through virtual gifts donated by fans on the site, which can be exchanged for money, he adds.

They met three years ago when Zou was working in Cameroon, where Made ran a hair salon. A year later, Zou proposed and the couple married in March 2017. Soon after, they relocated to Zou's hometown near Dandong, Liaoning province, in northeast China.

In 2016, there were just 1,700 mixed marriages in Liaoning, which is home to 43.7 million people, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics.

But Zou says there are five other Chinese men in his town with African wives. ""They all met in Africa ,"" he adds.

Sandra Made and Zou Qianshun's 10-month-old son, Daniel.

A love affair

Earlier this month, Chinese president Xi Jinping pledged to invest $60 billion in Africa over the next three years at the triennial Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing. It was symbolic of how China's ties with the continent have deepened over the past two decades.

About 10,000 Chinese-owned firms operate in Africa today, according to American research firm McKinsey, and a significant number of Africans have moved to China . Their main base is the southern manufacturing city of Guangzhou, where about 20,000 African migrants live, according to Gordon Mathews, a professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and author of ""The World in Guangzhou: Africans and Other Foreigners in South China.""

In Guangzhou, romances between Africans and Chinese people are not uncommon . But they mostly involve a Chinese woman and an African man , according to Mathews. That's partly because there are more male African traders in Guangzhou than female, he says.

""But Chinese women are also more socially adept, socially skilled and speak better English (than Chinese men),"" he adds. ""So they are more likely to marry foreigners than Chinese men.""

Racism in China

Sandra Made and Zou Qianshun met in Cameroon and married in 2017.

The most-viewed video on Made's feed is a comedy sketch of her pretending to feed her baby, Daniel, but instead putting all the food into her mouth.

Reactions on Kuaishou to the couple's humorous skits include ""666,"" which means cool, and ""Sandra! You're so beautiful,"" ""Pretty eyes,"" and ""You speak good Dandong dialect!"" Made says she improves her Putonghua by talking with fans online.

But not everyone's reaction has been so positive. Initially, Zou's mother, Zhao Fu Qing, was against their union. ""How can a Chinese marry a black woman? She can leave at any time. That's why at the beginning, both my husband and I said NO to this marriage,"" she told Al Jazeera . The couple say Zhao has since become fond of her daughter-in-law.

Chinese racism towards Africans, however, is a sensitive issue. Last year, a skit on China's biggest Lunar New Year TV show sparked outrage when an Asian actress appeared with blackface and enlarged bottom. Meanwhile, earlier this month a Chinese man was deported from Kenya for posting a video making racist remarks about Kenyans online.

""We haven't encountered any racist prejudices yet, apart from people's concerns about cultural differences,"" says Qianshun. ""But I always tell those people that love has no boundaries.""

Mathews says that while racism in China ""undoubtedly exists,"" extreme cases such as people rubbing Africans' skin to see if their color will come off are no longer an ""everyday thing.""

As the China-Africa economic relationship yields more unions like that of Made and Zou, Mathews hopes the public will gain a better understanding of race.

""The more international marriages we have the quicker we can end racism,"" he says."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180917151905-china-africa-mixed-marriage-super-tease.jpg

Rickety shacks stand on stilts in the polluted water. Canoes are required transportation through the maze of narrow canals. Okpoe's father is a fisherman, and her mother sells smoked fish, eking out a living on the fringes of Africa's largest city.

Lagos has a thriving economy built on oil, finance and manufacturing. And the city is now considered Nigeria's Silicon Valley, with Facebook and Google opening offices there earlier this year.

Yet it's estimated that as many as two-thirds of the city's 21 million residents live in slums that lack reliable electricity, clean water and sanitation.

""When I went to Makoko for the first time, I was surprised to see the living conditions of human beings,"" recalls Abisoye Ajayi-Akinfolarin, a computer programmer in Lagos. ""Most girls are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty. Many of them are not thinking education, a plan for the future.""

But several times a week, girls like Okpoe get a glimpse of another world when they attend GirlsCoding, a free program run by the Pearls Africa Foundation that seeks to educate -- and excite -- girls about computer programming. Since 2012, the group has helped more than 400 disadvantaged girls gain the technical skills and confidence they need to transform their lives.

It's the vision of Ajayi-Akinfolarin, who left a successful career to dedicate herself to this work. She'd noticed how few women worked in this growing field -- a 2013 government survey found that less than 8% of Nigerian women were employed in professional, managerial or technology jobs. She wanted to fix the gender gap.

""Technology is a space that's dominated by men. Why should we leave that to guys?"" she said. ""I believe girls need opportunities.""

Now, after school and during the summer, dozens of girls ages 10 to 17 get trained in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Scratch. Students come from slums or other challenging circumstances, such as orphanages, correctional homes and even a camp for those who've had to flee Boko Haram.

""I believe you can still find diamonds in these places,"" Ajayi-Akinfolarin said. ""They need to be shown another life.""

One way her program does this is by taking the students to visit tech companies -- not only showing them what technology can do, but helping them visualize themselves joining the industry.

Okpoe, for one, has taken this to heart. She helped create an app called Makoko Fresh that went live this summer, enabling fishermen like her father to sell seafood directly to customers. She wants to become a software engineer and hopes to study computer science at Harvard.

""One thing I want my girls to hold onto is, regardless of where they are coming from, they can make it,"" she said. ""They are coders. They are thinkers. Their future is bright.""

CNN spoke to Ajayi-Akinfolarin about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: How did you discover your love of computers?

Abisoye Ajayi-Akinfolarin: Life growing up for me was tough. Losing my mother at the age of 4, (being) beaten by my father -- life was just crazy. I learned to fend for myself.

My first experience with a computer was at the age of 10, on a school break, at a business center run by my brother's friend. Learning to type and modify text in Microsoft Word was just beautiful. But I really discovered my love for computers when I joined an IT firm as an intern after high school. When I got introduced to the world of computer programming, I was just natural with it. It just flowed. It's all about solving problems. I never knew that I'd be looking for solutions to problems regarding less privileged girls.

CNN: Isn't solving problems at the heart of your program?

Ajayi-Akinfolarin: That is what GirlsCoding is all about. We also want the girls to be leaders and change agents. We code towards a purpose, so they try to solve problems relating to what they see.

For example, one project that I really like is called Hope Baskets. The girls wanted to get beggars off the streets, so they created a website to be a bridge between the rich and the poor. They wanted a way where someone can declutter their house and give them a call. Then they take what they're getting rid of -- food, clothing, educational materials -- and give it to those in need.

We have another project called Break the Blade, about stopping female genital mutilation. These girls believe there is a lot of ignorance about this and want to be ambassadors on this issue. Eventually, they want to have a wrist band where you can press a button and it calls local authorities to come if FGM is about to take place.

The fact that they can create solutions to problems makes them feel bold. It is no longer about just coding.

CNN: What do you hope to do in the future?

Ajayi-Akinfolarin: Right now, we are expanding into different states in Nigeria. One day, we also hope to have an institution called Girls Village -- a residential program that would provide all types of training for young girls. We'd also give them a chance to incubate their ideas about how to solve problems in their communities and learn how to pitch them. You could call it a bigger version of what we are currently doing.

CNN: You gave up a career in a growing industry to do this work.

Berhe is a 22-year-old law student at the School of African and Oriental Studies in London. She writes for CNN about a global campaign on human rights she is coordinating where activists are holding 17 minutes of silent protest to commemorate the 17th anniversary of a press shutdown in Eritrea. The opinion expressed in this commentary are solely hers.

(CNN) It was one week after 9/11, and the world's attention was on New York City. The terrorist attack had changed the world forever, but in a small country in the Horn of Africa, things were about to alter even more drastically.

In the early hours of September 18th, 2001, a radio message announced the shutdown of the press in Eritrea.

Following the announcement, a group of journalists and politicians who had been advocating for democratic reforms were imprisoned without a trial

The country was due to hold its first-ever elections, but they were canceled , and several democratic institutions were shut down.

September 18 represented a significant turning point in Eritrean history, but the government's actions went mostly unnoticed to the outside world.

I grew up hearing about this date because my uncle, Seyoum Tsehaye, was one of the journalists imprisoned in 2001. Being born in Sweden, thousands of miles away from the rest of my family in Eritrea, my mom raised me with stories about home.

When I was 16 years old, I started advocating for Seyoum's release but realized quickly that his imprisonment was much more than a personal tragedy. There were so many more people affected.

Eritrea has been a country marked by war. It has been locked in perpetual conflict with neighboring Ethiopia. But in 2001, citizens were feeling generally optimistic about the future.

They had lived through a long independence struggle and the guerrilla group, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), had been instrumental in liberating the country from Ethiopia.

Almost by default, the EPLF guerrilla leader, Isaias Afwerki, became Eritrea's first president in 1993. The war of independence was fought on the premise of democracy, justice, and equality, so the unelected president assured the people that he would hold elections.

Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki

However, there have not been national elections in Eritrea since independence.

In 1998, a dispute centered on the new border with Ethiopia resulted in a war lasting two years . The Eritrean government has used this border war with Ethiopia as a justification for turning the country into a dictatorship.

A government has the right to suspend certain individual rights if there is a threat to national security, but the actions that have been committed as a response to the ""no peace, no war"" situation have been disproportionate to the actual threats.

The fact that there has been a standoff at the border cannot justify enlisting all capable Eritreans in national military service indefinitely and denying them autonomy over their own lives.

Neither does it justify the horrible rape, torture, and crimes committed with impunity there. The UN commission on human rights in Eritrea has described the country's national service as a "" crime against humanity ,"" and likened it to slavery.

It cannot justify the fact that the only university in the country has been shut down or that Eritreans between the ages of six and 65 are not allowed to leave the country unless granted an exit visa, one that is almost impossible to obtain.

The fact that Ethiopia has refused to demarcate the border cannot justify the fact that Eritrea is the only country without any independent press in Africa

It cannot possibly justify the fact that the parliament has not convened since 2002 . The government has refused to implement the country's first constitution, and tens of thousands of people have been imprisoned, without a trial , for merely expressing their opinions, practicing their religion or attempting to leave the country.

For the past five years, I have been advocating for human rights in Eritrea through the organization One Day Seyoum that I started in the name of my uncle. Despite the Eritrean government's insistence on using the border dispute as an excuse for the oppression in the country, I have never taken this justification seriously.

Not only have the crimes perpetrated by the Eritrean government been disproportionate to the threats posed by the conflict, but more than two months after signing a peace agreement with Ethiopia, President Afwerki has not addressed the domestic situation in the country, let alone made any promises to bring about change.

Despite this, this peace deal was blindly celebrated, and Afwerki congratulated by politicians from all over the world. With the prospects of change seeming as distant as before the peace agreement, we started the campaign #QuestionsForIsaias demanding answers about Eritrea's future.

With our leader not listening to the cry of his people, Eritreans from all over the world were forced to turn to social media.

We are launching a new campaign on the 17th anniversary of the creation of the Eritrean dictatorship to increase pressure on the Eritrean government.

We aim to continue to actively and publicly ask questions to Afwerki but also to share content explaining our questions to raise awareness about what is going on in Eritrea, to increase worldwide pressure for change.

We ask questions because my cousins deserve to see their father. We ask questions because my cousins are far from the only ones.

We ask questions because enough is enough. The indefinite national service program is robbing Eritrean youth of their future.

They face the stark choices of a life without a future in Eritrea or being killed or severely traumatized as they try to flee the country.

We ask questions because we refuse to stay silent when our people are suffering.

We ask questions because the Eritrean people deserve better."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180918143157-vanessa-berhe-super-tease.jpeg
8d03d6e19941440abf2e991da948e524	[]		EMPLOYED BY CHINA	https://www.cnn.com/	US	EMPLOYED BY CHINA	1	"EMPLOYED BY CHINA It’s often assumed that the Chinese in Africa ‘bring their own’ and don’t hire locals. In Ethiopia, that’s not the case -- but will it lift the country out of poverty? Words, video and images by Jenni Marsh, CNN

The assembly line at Huajian International Shoe City, Addis Ababa.

Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — Zhang Huarong points out of his office window to a bleak block of grey portacabins at the Huajian International Shoe City, in Addis Ababa. “That is what I lived in for six months when I came to Africa,” he says. “I am 60 years old. Back in China, I am a wealthy man -- my house in Dongguan even has a swimming pool. But I chose to come here and do something very difficult.” In 2011, this self-made textile tycoon from Jiangxi province became one of the first Chinese entrepreneurs to heed the call of Ethiopia’s then-Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to open a factory in his country. Within three months, Huajian was producing footwear for giants such as Nine West, Guess and, later, Ivanka Trump’s fashion line, before it closed. “This is something God is telling me to do,” Zhang (pictured below) says, framing himself as a 21st-century manufacturing missionary whose goal is to create more than 100,000 jobs in the poorest parts of Africa. Rwanda is next. “In China, no one wants to make shoes anymore,” he adds. Ethiopia is undoubtedly one of the continent’s poorest countries, but that’s changing. In the decade leading up to 2016, Ethiopia’s economy swelled 10% a year making it the fastest growing in Africa. And with 100 million people, 70% of whom are under age 30, it also has the continent’s second-largest population. That’s both a massive demographic dividend and a real risk: with unemployment at 16.8%, jobs are urgently required. Businessmen like Zhang are seen as the country’s ticket out of poverty. Huajian employs 7,500 local workers at its two enormous factories in the Addis Ababa region. “As long as they have the right skills and training, Africans are just like Asians and Europeans,” he says. Huajian makes shoes exclusively for American clients. As one of the biggest Chinese employers in Ethiopia, Huajian has attracted intense scrutiny. Reports last year of poor working conditions at the firm’s Guangdong factory, in China, and rock bottom wages in Addis Ababa saw two customers, one of whom was Trump, jump ship. While many of the criticisms were valid, Huajian is operating in an environment of deep Western suspicion of the Chinese in Africa. In March, Rex Tillerson, then secretary of state, told leaders at the African Union, in Addis Ababa, that Chinese investors “do not bring significant job creation locally.” His comments echoed warnings about neo-colonialism in Africa and Chinese labor importation by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, respectively. “China is a rising economy, and it’s going to be the global number one by 2030 latest,” says Arkebe Oqubay, a senior government official and architect of much of Ethiopia’s industrialization strategy. “There’s always rivalry when a great power diminishes. But we as the Africans are the ones to say if we are benefiting from China. We don’t need a witness.”

About 4,000 Ethiopian workers are employed at the Huajian International Shoe City, Addis Ababa.

‘Even my father doesn’t like being a farmer’ When Emaway Gashaw was 18 years old, she got on a bus and waved goodbye to her large family of coffee farmers. The journey from Jimma, in western Ethiopia, to Addis Ababa took 10 hours. She wound up in Jemo, a suburb of the capital that a decade ago was countryside but today is dotted by concrete condos housing rural migrants looking for work, including her elder cousin. “When I got here, I didn’t have any opportunities so I took this job,” she says. Emaway is a leather skiver at the Huajian International Light Industry City, a 1.5 million-square-meter industrial park that, will eventually provide housing, hospitals and schooling onsite, employ 100,000 workers, and within 10 years create $4 billion in revenue, according to the company. The Jemo area of Addis Ababa is becoming increasingly urban. From 8 a.m. until 5 p.m., Emaway forms part of a sprawling assembly line inside a brightly lit, air-conditioned shed that looks like a giant aircraft hangar. But her wages allow for little. “I get paid 1,200 birr ($44) a month with overtime,” she says. “After rent and food, there is nothing left. My cousin has to support me.” Emaway is one of the lowest-paid workers at the factory. Getachew Tilanun, 20, is from a family of maize farmers in Welega, where Ethiopia borders South Sudan in the west. After working at the factory for two years, he has been promoted twice and now earns 2,500 birr (about $90) a month, and receives three meals a day and the chance to live onsite for subsidized rent. Unlike 90% of International Labour Organization member states, Ethiopia has no minimum wage. The international poverty line is about $57 a month. Emaway Gashaw, 18 years old, has worked at Huajian for nine months. “For my wage, I have a lot of responsibility,” he says, explaining that he oversees 100 workers, including 11 line supervisors. “If they make mistakes, my wages get docked.” Getachew has taught himself to speak Chinese to give himself “unique” employment skills. “I tried to find out everything I could about China on the internet,” he says. “When I saw Asian people, I just tried to speak to them.” His work is tough, but the alternative is worse. “Even my father doesn’t like being a farmer,” Getachew says. “It’s the job of the very uneducated.” Just 1% of the 4,000 workers at the Jemo factory are Chinese, says Bonn Liang, a manager who was headhunted from Dongguan one year ago. ""But in the future, we will all go back to China,” he adds. That’s already happened at the Sino-Ethiop Associate pharmaceutical factory in Dukem, south of Addis. A joint venture between two Chinese and one Ethiopian firm, the facility has 177 employees, only one of whom is Chinese. “In our first year, some Ethiopian workers were sent to China for training, and about 50 Chinese experts came here,” says Andrew Shegaw, the factory manager. “Now we are 100% independent.” The factory employs Ethiopian pharmacists, engineers, and electricians, who received workplace training from the Chinese to supplement their academic knowledge. A worker at the Sino-Ethiop Associate pharmaceutical factory in Dukem. Contrary to popular belief, these scenarios are not unusual. A groundbreaking McKinsey report last year, which surveyed more than 1,000 Chinese companies in construction, manufacturing, trade, real estate, and services in eight African countries, including Ethiopia, found that on average 89% of employees were African. Several million African jobs had been created by China on the continent. Nearly two-thirds of Chinese companies provided skills training, while half offered apprenticeships, and a third had introduced a new technology. It was the first time a large-scale dataset on Chinese hiring practices in Africa had been made available, and it rebutted the criticisms voiced by Tillerson. “I believe that (his claim) was very short-sighted,” Arkebe says. “It’s hard to believe a secretary of state was misinformed.”"	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/08/29/china-ethiopia-tease.jpg
f3d7ced62f914a12beb426be39c67d48	[]	2018-09-18 11:50:21+00:00	New sphinx uncovered in Egypt	https://www.cnn.com/	US	New sphinx uncovered in Egypt	1	"(CNN) — Some amazing archeological finds involve daring adventures into hidden tombs. Others -- as is the case with the discovery of a beautiful new sphinx in Egypt -- simply involve a spot of drainage.

The newly uncovered sandstone statue, believed to be more than 2,000 years old, was revealed during work to lower the groundwater level in an ancient temple.

Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities said on its Facebook page that the sphinx was found on the southeastern side of the Kom Ombo temple near the southern city of Aswan.

Images released by the ministry show a classic sphinx, with the body of lion and the head of a human, wearing a snake crown and headdress. The statue appears to be mostly intact.

Mostafa Waziri, general secretary of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, says the statue dates from the Ptolemaic era which ran from 300 BC to 30 BC. He said it was found close to the location where two sandstone reliefs of King Ptolemy V were recovered two months earlier.

More excavations are expected to take place around the temple to try to learn more about the sphinx, Abdel Moneim Saeed, general director of Aswan Antiquities, said, according to the ministry.

Sphinxes are recurring creatures in the mythologies of ancient Egyptian, Persian and Greek cultures. Their likeness are often found near tombs or religious buildings.

Crocodile mummies

An ancient Egyptian tomb that was discovered in 1940 was opened to the public for the first time on September 8.

The most famous, the Great Sphinx of Giza, is believed to have been built next to the Nile river in about 2500 BC for the pharaoh Khafra, who also ordered construction of one of the pyramids of Giza.

While the Great Sphinx is an imposing 73 meters (240 feet) long and more than 20 meters high, the latest discovery at Kom Ombo is reported to be a mere 38 centimeters high.

Kom Ombo is considered unusual for an ancient Egyptian temple because it is dedicated to two separate deities -- crocodile god Sobek and falcon god Haroeris.

Three hundred crocodile mummies discovered near the temple are displayed in an adjacent Crocodile Museum.

Highlighting the fact that Egypt still has mysteries yet to uncover, the sphinx may help draw more visitors back to a country whose recent social and political upheavals led to a sharp decline in tourism.

One woman is trying to change that	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Only men can inherit the title of chief in Lesotho. One woman is trying to change that	1	"CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equal s, a year-long series.

Ha Mamathe, Lesotho — Senate Masupha sits in her family home in the village of Ha Mamathe in Lesotho, under a portrait of her late mother.

The inscription on the portrait, written in the Sesotho language, acknowledges her mother's role as principal chief of Ha Mamathe and the villages that surround it -- a position that she held for 12 years before her death in 2008.

Outside, the carefully tended flower garden, wooden trimmings on the porch and old sandstone buildings have a story to tell. For generations, members of the Masupha family have lived and served as chiefs of this area.

David Masupha, Senate Masupha's father, was principal chief before his death in 1996, and was a direct descendant of King Moshoeshoe I, the revered founder of Lesotho, home to the Basotho people.

""My parents were chiefs for all of their lives -- that was their right. I felt very secure when I was growing up,"" recalls Masupha. ""But when my mother passed on, I was taken out of my comfort zone. There was a sudden tension in the family about who would inherit the chieftainship. I was a victim of this tension, because it was as if I wasn't even there.""

Senate Masupha is fighting for the law on chieftainship to be changed.

Masupha is the only child in her family, but Lesotho's laws prohibit women from inheriting the chieftainship. Women can take on the role if their chief husbands die, but afterwards the position can be inherited only by a male heir.

When talk in the family turned to the possibility of evicting Masupha from her parents' home, she decided to take action. In 2013, she filed a case with Lesotho's Constitutional Court for her right to inherit the chieftainship, arguing that the existing law was discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional.

But the court rejected her case -- as did the Court of Appeal one year later, where the judge argued that modernizing the rule was a matter for Parliament.

Masupha's uncle -- her father's younger brother -- took over as principal chief, but she continues to live in her parents' home and to battle for change that she believes is long overdue.

Laws that prohibit women from inheriting the role of chief have been invalidated in South Africa -- and in Namibia, Botswana and Zambia, women can now be appointed chiefs on the same terms as their male counterparts.

Meanwhile, little has changed in Lesotho.

""A woman in Lesotho is not discriminated against -- she simply doesn't exist,"" says Kuena Thabane of the Lesotho Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), which has been supporting Masupha's fight.

Like Masupha, Kuena Thabane is frustrated by the current chieftainship law.

Sitting in her small, cluttered office in the capital Maseru, Thabane gives an exasperated half-laugh. ""You can only discriminate against someone who exists, but in Lesotho's laws on succession and inheritance, women are not even mentioned -- they are entirely overlooked.""

The Lesotho government has not responded to a request for comment.

Among Lesotho's 22 principal chiefs, who make up the majority of the country's Senate, Khoabane Theko, principal chief of Thaba Bosiu, says he is the lone supporter of Masupha's fight.

""A girl child does not choose to be born as a girl, so in my opinion the laws that discriminate against her are totally heinous,"" says Theko, speaking at his home near the historical mountain fortress where King Moshoeshoe I established the Basotho nation.

He points out the hypocrisy in the current system, in which female chiefs who take over from their husbands are generally well respected, yet their female children are denied access to the role.

""We don't consider the brilliance of a girl child and what she might be able to bring to the chieftainship if she was given the chance to rule,"" he says.

Khoabane Theko is one of Masupha's few supporters in the Senate.

Most other principal chiefs disagree. Peete Lesaoana Peete of Koeneng and Mapoteng holds firmly to prevailing cultural norms, arguing that in Basotho culture, a woman marries into the man's family and any future children belong to his clan.

""It cannot work the other way around,"" explains Peete. ""If a girl child inherits the chieftainship she will take it out of the family when she gets married; she will derail the royal lineage. She cannot marry a man into her family. That is culturally taboo.""

Thabane is frustrated by this view that privileges tradition above all else and believes culture should not always be preserved.

""In my opinion, culture is an instrument that is used to oppress, and especially to oppress women,"" she says.

Khoabane Theko, principal chief of Thaba Bosiu, reads the law against discrimination in the Constitution of Lesotho.

Masupha agrees, rejecting any logic that sees women getting married as an obstacle.

And she's hopeful that her constant campaigning, while having little effect on the laws of the land, is starting to have impacts at a grassroots level.

She begins to smile as she describes how some women in her community who are facing gender-based violence or discrimination often confide in her.

""This tells me that they understand my fight and that it's made them look at the reality within their own families and break the silence and speak out,"" Masupha says.

And it's a learning experience for her too. ""Their experiences tell me that my case isn't only happening within my home -- it's also happening within my community.""

Two residents of Ha Mamathe walk along a tar road leading to the village.

But raising Masupha's case with men and women at a bustling intersection in her home village reveals a divided community.

Mpoetsi 'Mamosa Lereka, 43, stands out from the crowd in her trousers and heels, a rare sight in rural Lesotho, where most women wear skirts or dresses.

Her face lights up when she hears Masupha's name. She remembers when her mother was chief and welcomes Masupha's challenge to the entrenched gender stereotypes that still govern the views of so many in Lesotho, including many women.

""When it comes to leadership, we always vote for men in Lesotho. We are made to believe that men should be leaders; that's our mentality,"" she says, adding: ""We sideline ourselves as women. It's long overdue that this inheritance law changes; we need more women leaders in this country.""

'Makhotso Makhoebe, a slightly older woman in a skirt, warm jacket and beanie, is one of those who opposes change. Shading her eyes from the harsh midday sun, she shakes her head as she speaks.

""Women should not be given leadership,"" she says. ""They don't deserve that kind of power -- they have many more weaknesses than men and they don't know how to talk to people. We don't trust them. It's good that Senate Masupha lost her case.""

A 70-year-old woman, who did not want to be identified, waits for a taxi on the outskirts of Ha Mamathe. She supports Masupha's fight. ""Even if she was a girl, she had the right to be a chief,"" she says.

Inside the Masupha family home on the edge of Ha Mamathe, Senate Masupha reflects on her uphill battle.

""Patriarchy is entrenched in the fabric of our society, to the extent that women themselves see it as a normal way of life and continue to enforce it,"" she says, a hint of tiredness in her voice.

She sighs, shifts in her seat and then raises her head, her expression still determined as she points out the progress toward gender equality made by Lesotho's neighbors.

""There's no way that Lesotho can sustain its current retrogressive laws,"" she says. ""It's only a matter of time before we get to where we're supposed to be."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180910160242-01-as-equals-lesotho-chieftanship-super-tease.jpg

But East Africa's No. 1 travel destination (nearly 1.5 million international visitors in 2017) is actually a multifaceted place with a wide variety of adventures both rural and urban.

While wildlife remains the lodestone, Kenya also offers awesome Indian Ocean beaches , world-class mountain trekking, surprisingly good nightlife, an eclectic cultural heritage and interesting ways to get around (from ancient sailing craft to a spanking brand new railway line).

Check out our list of 20 of the best things to do in Kenya:

1. Summit Mt Kenya

High altitude hotspot: Mt. Kenya Kenya Tourism Board

Rising to just over 17,000 feet (3,800 meters), Mt Kenya is the continent's second highest peak. But the summit trails are far less crowded than its snowy counterpart (Kilimanjaro) across the border in Tanzania.

You'll likely have the mountain all to your own during a trek that normally spans five days from start to finish (with four overnights on the mountain). True to its name, Mount Kenya Safaris offers guided trips via any of the three main routes to the top.

2. Watch the Great Migration in Masai Mara

Arriving from the neighboring Serengeti Plains, millions of wildebeest, antelope and zebra -- and the predators that follow them -- thunder through Masai Mara National Reserve between July and October during the Great Migration.

The spectacle can be viewed on game drives, airplane or hot-air balloon flights, walking or horseback safaris.

3. Soak up sea, sun & sand at Diani

With African American director Ryan Coogler at the helm, the film revives the 1960s Marvel Comics character, also known as T'Challa, king of the fictional African nation of Wakanda.

""Like millions of others, when I heard that the film was being made, I was very excited,"" said the co-founder of Philadelphia-based clothing brand Ikiré Jones. ""I selfishly thought that our designs would be the perfect representation for the [lead] character.""

He decided to reach out to Marvel on Twitter.

Of course, he accepted. When T'Challa -- played by Chadwick Boseman -- appears at the United Nations in the film, he is wearing an Ikiré Jones scarf.

Ikiré Jones created several pieces for the film, but only one -- the silk scarf ""From Wakanda, with Love"" -- made it into the final edit. The scarf is made in Italy and retails for $285.

""It was pretty stunning to see our work presented on such a large platform,"" said Oyejide.

A reflection of heritage

After working as a hip-hop producer collaborating with the likes of Detroit rapper J Dilla, and then training as an attorney, Oyejide founded Ikiré Jones in 2012 with tailor Sam Hubler. He had studied with Hubler's sister at law school.

""It seemed like a natural decision for us to put our talents together,"" said Oyejide, who moved from Nigeria to the United States when he was a teenager. The brand relates to his family story. ""Ikiré is a town in Nigeria where my father grew up, [and] Jones is my wife's family name,"" he added.

Ikiré Jones has established an aesthetic that projects ""nobility and cultural inclusion,"" explained Oyejide. ""Our work blends conventional European silhouettes with bolder colors and fabrics that are inspired by African culture.""

The Wakanda effect

""Black Panther"" made $1 billion at the box office globally within a month of release. Since it opened in the United States in February, Ikiré Jones has a seen a fivefold increase in sales, according to Oyejide.

The boutique brand, which has just two permanent members of staff, sells to customers through its website.

""We find ourselves having to adjust to the vast increase in scale that we are putting out,"" said Oyejide. ""It's a good challenge for any business to deal with.""

He wants his brand to use the spotlight to further its cultural mission.

b5bae55bfb574456a3fe47e0a75bb493	['Katy Scott']	2017-10-11 00:00:00	This football star scored a new career making Cognac	https://www.cnn.com/	US	This football star scored a new career making Cognac	1	"When professional footballers retire, some go into coaching while others become TV analysts. Not many produce their own Cognac.

Olivier Tebily spent years on the international football circuit, including a lengthy stint in the English Premier League. The defender also played for his home nation of Ivory Coast.

The retired footballer, 41, now spends his days tending vineyards in western France, turning grapes into Cognac.

Tebily was a toddler when his family moved from Ivory Coast to France. It was there, as a teenager, that he was first introduced to life on a vineyard.

But what started as a summer job for a young man in search of pocket change would turn into a passion -- and a business.

When Tebily signed his first professional contract at the age of 18, one of his first purchases was a few hectares of vineyards.

His family tended the vines during a football career with stops at clubs in France, Scotland, England and Canada. A highlight was representing Ivory Coast at the the Africa Cup of Nations.

When it was time to retire from the sport, Tebily knew where he wanted to be: Back among the vines.

""The day I decided to stop my career I stopped completely and I switched professions,"" said Tebily. ""I made the choice to stop football and resume my wine making.""

Cognac is a special spirit. Renowned for its richness, the brandy can only be made from white grapes in the Cognac region of France. Popular brands include Hennessy and Courvoisier.

Tebily said it was hard to get started in the insular business, which produces annual exports worth $3.5 billion.

""For me to enter a world of viticulture ... shocked a lot of winemakers, because the vineyards are usually transferred from father to son,"" he said.

Related: This app helps regular folks make sense of wine

Tebily was able to expand his acreage when a Cognac producer who was nearing retirement took a liking to the former footballer and agreed to sell his vineyards.

""He preferred to let an African achieve his dream,"" said Tebily. ""It gave him satisfaction to do the opposite of what everybody expected.""

The 22 hectares that Tebily now owns yield roughly 11,000 bottles of Cognac a year. He sells part of the haul to a larger producer, while the rest is sold under his own label, Cognac OT.

The label has four varieties that sell for between $37 and $305. The cheapest is aged for a minimum of two years, while the premier ""Tres Vieux"" offering matures for over 25 years.

Tebily said he hopes his career change will serve as an inspiration to others.

""I realized that everybody is capable of doing something completely different than they did before,"" he said. ""For an ex-player to do something else is very encouraging, it's very gratifying."""	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171009174417-olivier-tebily-cognac-780x439.jpeg

While unconventional, marketing events like this have become a trademark of BOS, an iced tea brand that has conquered the South African market and is now gaining converts in the United States and Europe.

""We want to put a smile on your face and create those moments of joy,"" said CEO Dave Evans, who joined the company shortly after it was launched in 2010.

Consumers and employees have been seduced by the company's playful attitude and slick branding. Other marketing projects include Twitter-activated vending machines and artsy skateboarding parties.

Evans attributes much of the firm's success to its eccentric marketing efforts, but the company also relies on a winning local ingredient.

Indigenous to South Africa, BOS organic tea is made from the rooibos (red bush) plant. It's ""quintessentially from South Africa"" said Evans. The company says the tea is rich in antioxidants, a selling point for increasingly health-conscious consumers.

The company is tapping into a booming global market for premium beverages, including products without alcohol. Over the past decade, traditional carbonated drinks have lost 10% of their market share, according to Evans, and a wave of competing brands such as Britain's Fever Tree have enjoyed rapid growth.

With flavor combinations ranging from lemon and peach to lime and ginger, BOS sold roughly 10 million units last year. ""We've run at north of 70% compound annual growth rate since 2011,"" said Evans.

The CEO believes the next big market is the United States, which offers ""tremendous growth opportunities."" Having only launched in California in December, he expects half of the firm's sales to come from the United States within three years. The tea is being sold in premium natural food retailers.

BOS launched its first international office in Amsterdam in 2014, and it now sells iced tea in 14 countries.

The company does need to be careful about sourcing its key ingredient. Rooibos plants take three years to generate their first harvest.

But that hasn't scared away investors. For example, former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson purchased a 10% stake in the company."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180809113233-bos-cans-780x439.jpg

The telescope is made up of 64 satellite dishes that are connected across five miles in a semi-arid and sparsely populated area of South Africa, where signal interference is minimal.

Each satellite dish stands 65 feet tall, and weighs roughly as much as seven large African bush elephants. The number and sensitivity of the dishes have enabled scientists to produce breakthrough images using the telescope.

""They just did everything right,"" said Farhad Yusef-Zadeh, an astronomy expert at Northwestern University in Illinois. ""This image that I saw it just blew me away, I never thought we would see these details.""

Officially launched in July, the telescope has also made South Africa a key global destination for radio astronomy.

MeerKAT was funded by the South African government and 75% of the work went to local companies. Organizers say the project supported over 7,000 jobs in rural local communities.

EMSS Antennas, which is based near Cape Town, built the receivers for MeerKAT using a team of 30 engineers.

Aspen Pharmacare (APNHY) has also developed a leading position in medication for thrombosis, used to prevent blood clotting.

Luresha Chetty, an analyst at Standard Bank, said Aspen had made acquisitions in both fields, allowing it to ""move onto the leader board"" by sales for those therapies.

Aspen executives are focusing on high potency drugs, such as those used to break down cancer cells and hormonal replacement treatments.

Aspen Pharmacare currently delivers daily antiretroviral treatments to approximately 1 million patients. Only 50,000 people in Africa had access to such drugs 15 years ago.

Its largest manufacturing plants are in Europe and South Africa, where lower costs support mass production. The European sites focus heavily on the use of technology.

By acquiring products from rivals such as GlaxoSmithKline (GLAXF) and AstraZeneca (AZN), Aspen has been able to benefit from economies of scale.

b8c55e0309e34bd9959c76a87cee1a7a	['Katy Scott']	2018-09-03 00:00:00	How diamonds are mined from the bottom of Atlantic ocean	https://www.cnn.com/	US	How diamonds are mined from the bottom of Atlantic ocean	1	"(CNN) Millions of years ago, precious gem stones from the heart of southern Africa washed westward along the Orange River and emptied into the Atlantic Ocean.

While some swept up on the beaches along the Namibian coast , spurring a diamond rush in 1908, others came to rest on the ocean floor. For a little while at least.

Today, six ships comb the ocean, sucking sediment from the seabed. The immense vessels are operated by Debmarine Namibia, a joint venture between the Namibian Government and diamond giant De Beers.

Last year the marine diamond mining company produced 1.378 million carats of diamonds, at a time when the country's land operations are waning.

To ramp up production, Debmarine Namibia plans to construct a $142 million ship-cum-tanker, which it says will be the world's largest custom-built diamond mining vessel , measuring 577 feet long. It hopes this new vessel will join the fleet by 2021.

This type of vehicle -- called a crawler ship -- has a 280-ton mechanical arm that moves in a horizontal arc, dredging material from just beneath the sea floor, at depths of around 400 feet.

Diamonds are then sifted from the dredged gravel in a sophisticated treatment plant onboard the ship. The gravel is returned to the ocean and the gems are securely sealed in containers, loaded into steel briefcases, and flown by helicopter to shore.

No human hands touch the diamonds during the entire production process at sea.

Gems in a haystack

Debmarine Namibia has a license to operate off the coast of Namibia until 2035 within a 2,316 square mile area -- just under half the size of Jamaica.

But, while the ships mine 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, they're not scouring every last square mile, explains Otto Shikongo, CEO of Debmarine Namibia.

""You only mine areas which are mineable and profitable,"" Shikongo tells CNN. ""It doesn't mean that every place that you find diamonds you go mine.""

He says Debmarine Namibia has depleted a total of 50 square miles since production began in 2002, just two percent of the license area.

""The resource is patchy and not homogenous,"" he says, adding that the future of the mining will depend on their understanding of the seabed and technological advances.

""It's not the same as a land-based resource which you can see with your eyes ... this one is 120 meters [393 feet] under the water,"" he says.

Every so often Debmarine Namibia sends out unmanned, autonomous vehicles -- much like underwater drones -- to survey the seabed using sonar technology.

The team also makes use of a two-person submarine to examine the geology of the seafloor.

Next, a 12,000 ton exploration vessel scoops large samples from areas that are believed to hold diamonds.

To date these combined technologies have identified a mineralized area -- or an area containing diamonds -- of 617 square miles. This makes up just over a quarter of the total license area.

The hope is to discover more diamond-containing areas through further exploration and sampling, explains Shikongo.

Debmarine Namibia's submarine examines the geology of the seabed.

Survival of the fittest

While marine diamonds may be difficult to find, they're certainly worth the hunt.

Shikongo explains how nature ensured that only the ""fittest"" diamonds survived the journey along the Orange River, while weaker, imperfect stones were destroyed.

""Because the diamonds went through a high energy process, almost like a tumbling effect, only the best, high quality diamonds survived and made it to the sea,"" he says.

As a result, Shikongo estimates that 95% of diamonds recovered from the sea are of ""gem quality,"" compared to just 40-60% of diamonds from land operations.

Employees grade and store rough diamonds at the Namibian Diamonds Trading Company in Windhoek, Namibia.

Environmental cost?

But, in the search for these precious gems, thousands of tons of sediment is dredged up and then dumped overboard.

Marine scientists argue that seabed mining degrades the marine environment, potentially impacting marine species.

""The waters off the coast of Namibia are an important area for a high diversity of resident and migratory species, such as sharks, whales, dolphins and seals,"" Kirsten Thompson, a marine scientist from the University of Exeter, tells CNN over email.

""Marine mining removes parts of the seabed with heavy machinery and habitat recovery from this type of disturbance can take decades.""

But Shikongo says Debmarine Namibia continually monitors its footprint.

According to Shikongo, the company's environmental monitoring program found that it takes between two to 10 years for the seabed, and associated marine life, to recover.

However, in rockier terrains natural recovery could take more than 10 years.

Thompson adds that diamond mining can impact ocean life through increased ship traffic, noise, light and pollution, and is just one of many activities degrading the marine environment.

""Marine species are already experiencing profound changes due to climate change and other human-related activities, such as fishing, plastic pollution and shipping,"" she says.

""Some species and habitats are simply not resilient enough to cope with these multiple stresses simultaneously.""

Offshore mining is increasingly important for the diamond industry in Namibia, as land-based production begins to tail off.

""Land operations have been there since 1908,"" explains Shikongo. ""So these resources are not finite as we know and as time goes ... production tends to taper down.""

Debmarine Namibia commenced marine mining operations in 2002, with a haul of approximately 500,000 carats . At the time, sister company Namdeb's land operations were producing around a million carats.

But over the years the tables have turned and marine operations now account for close to 75% of total diamond production in the country, according to Namibia's Chamber of Mines

With all eyes on the Atlantic, the question remains: How soon will we exhaust this precious underwater resource?

Shikongo believes there are probably enough stones scattered across the Atlantic seabed for Debmarine Namibia to continue mining for at least the next 20 years.

The only challenge is finding them."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180831125612-diamond-mining-vessel-super-tease.jpg

Despite their limited tech knowledge, the Nigerian teens learned how to build a mobile app from scratch by using opensource software from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The app, called FD-Detector, helps users identify fake medicines using a drug's barcode to verify its authenticity and expiration date.

""I feel very excited and relieved. I'm extremely proud of myself,"" Osita, 15, told CNN from San Francisco, in the group's first interview since they won the 2018 Technovation Challenge on 9 August.

Named Team Save-A-Soul -- Promise Nnalue, Jessica Osita, Nwabuaku Ossai, Adaeze Onuigbo and Vivian Okoye -- spent five months researching and building the app and hope it can be a solution to the widespread sale of counterfeit drugs in Nigeria.

For Osita, there was a more personal, poignant reason for creating the app -- her brother died after fake drugs were administered to him following an accident.

""My brother died from fake drugs. I'm very motivated by the death of my brother to solve this problem,"" she said.

""With this app, we will relieve the burden. I feel very excited,"" said Osita, who has ambitions to become a pharmacist. ""I want to produce genuine drugs,"" she says.

Osita and her four other teammates beat teams from the US, Spain, Turkey, Uzbekistan and China in the finals to secure the top spot in the junior category at the competition.

""Some people told me 'you're a girl, why are you going into tech?'"" said Osita. ""At first my parents didn't understand what I was doing, but it's only recently that they see what I'm doing. They are very, very proud.""

Since their win, they have been feted and the world's media has been clamoring to interview them.

Winners of 2018 Silicon Valley contest, Promise Nnalue, Jessica Osita, Nwabuaku Ossai, Adaeze Onuigbo and Vivian Okoye pose with their mentor Uchenna Ugwu.

One of her teammates Promise Nnalue, 14, told CNN: ""People are calling us celebrities and taking pictures with us. I'm very happy. We could not have done this without our mentor. She really believed in us and encouraged us,"" said Nnalue, who aspires to become a doctor.

Speaking to the teenagers it is clear that their mentor Uchenna Ugwu has had a profound impact on their lives.

Ugwu was the one who introduced them to computers and coding through her Edufun Technik organization, which teaches STEM to underprivileged children in Anambra State, southeastern Nigeria.

Ugwu says her organization has taught approximately 4,800 school children since 2014 -- over 60% of whom have been young girls -- as a means of closing the widening gender gap in STEM education.

""This is the first interview I'm granting,"" Ugwu told CNN from San Francisco where she says they are still in shock from the win.

""I'm overwhelmed. It was a beautiful experience for them. They have experienced so many firsts. They were entering a flight for the first time. The girls were scared and overwhelmed. They asked me 'How can we compete with these countries who have been using tech for a very long time?'

""I told them 'it's not how long ago you started, but how well you do.' I'm so proud of them because they were so determined to learn,"" she said. ""They were not the most talented in the coding class but they were the most determined. They stuck with the classes when a lot of their peers dropped out,"" she added.

Ugwu, a mother-of three, said they practiced their pitch endlessly, and it was their effort and passion that helped them win.

""The girls really impressed a lot of people,"" she said. ""To be honest, every progress we made was a win to me.

""They have come very far qualifying out of more than 2,000 apps submitted. They are winners in every way,"" she said.

""Five months ago, they didn't have access to the internet or how to write an email. They could not believe that they had the opportunity to touch the almighty computer. It's amazing.""

Technovation is run by education nonprofit Iridescent and challenges girls aged 10-18 to create an app that solves problems in their communities.

""It is inspiring seeing the hard work and determination of girls around the world working to solve big challenges in their communities with smart solutions,"" Iridescent founder Tara Chklovski said in a statement.

The teenage girls will partner with the Nigeria's drug regulatory agency, Technovation's organizers said.

Ugwu hopes this win will encourage other young girls to tackle some of the problems Nigeria is facing.

""The next thing is to use this moment to inspire more girls. How do we leverage on this to build our nation? How do we inspire other girls to start thinking about solutions to our problems? We need to let young people know that they are the solutions to their problems, if we do that Nigeria will be better."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180816130231-01-nigerian-girls-win-silicon-valley-contest-super-tease.jpg
470496531c0f4f86a004046e384bc3e2	['Katy Scott']	2018-08-15 00:00:00	Drones driven by AI will track illegal fishing in African waters	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Drones driven by AI will track illegal fishing in African waters	1	"(CNN) Across the African continent, drones are finding innovative uses -- from monitoring displaced populations, to delivering critical medical supplies.

Moroccan technology startup ATLAN Space is developing artificial intelligence (AI) to guide autonomous drones so they can scan large areas for ""environmental crimes"" like illegal fishing , poaching or deforestation.

In June, ATLAN Space won the National Geographic Society's $150,000 Marine Protection Prize to implement a pilot project to combat illegal fishing in the Seychelles.

Drones will be armed with information about illegal fishing hotspots, explains Badr Idrissi, CEO and co-founder of ATLAN Space.

Once a drone detects a boat, AI will enable it to verify whether it is a cruising boat, tanker or fishing vessel. The drone will then establish whether the boat is operating inside a marine protected area, and if it is an authorized fishing vessel.

If it concludes that the activity is illegal, the drone will register the boat's location, identification number, and number of people on board and relay this information to authorities via satellite.

Currently governments employ light aircraft or coast guard vessels for this kind of surveillance.

""With artificial intelligence we are able to replace the pilot, the data analyst, transmission equipment, and with that we can reduce the cost,"" says Idrissi, a former account manager at Microsoft.

He adds that using drones guided by AI would relieve coast guards from their monitoring duties and allow them to focus on intercepting vessels.

According to Idrissi, ATLAN Space technology can be integrated in any type of drone. He says the operational range could reach up to 800 kilometers when using drones equipped with a combustion engine.

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a drone powered by artificial intelligence.

Idrissi, 37 and co-founder Younes Moumen, 35, both based in Rabat, started developing the technology when they learned that illegal fishing costs coastal countries in West Africa approximately $2.3 billion every year.

""We consider ourselves a partner of government to build a sustainable solution to the issues and challenges they are facing,"" Idrissi says.

Drones for good

ATLAN Space is one of many startups innovating with drone technology on the continent.

In Rwanda, drones deliver vital medical supplies like blood and vaccines to remote areas.

They are also used for critical humanitarian missions, like mapping displaced people in Niger, Burkina Faso and Uganda.

In Lilongwe, Malawi, UNICEF partnered with the government to set up a testing corridor in 2017 to investigate how drones can be used for humanitarian work.

Over the past year, universities and private sector companies have used drones to map cholera outbreaks and mosquito breeding sites in the corridor.

""The idea is to see what's working in Malawi and be able to scale the solutions to a global level,"" UNICEF's Michael Scheibenreif tells CNN.

""Drones will substantially change our way of working in Africa,"" says Scheibenreif. ""As a leapfrog technology they can help us to deliver goods like medicine quickly ... in places where developed transportation networks or roads do not exist.""

Sky's the limit?

But drone expert and World Bank Consultant Frederick Mbuya, who has previously worked on drone mapping projects in Tanzania and Zanzibar , cautions that drones, while hugely effective in land surveying and delivery of medical supplies, are not always the silver bullet they're hyped up to be.

""Drones have a huge potential to impact Africa, and not just the rich, all areas of Africa,"" he tells CNN. ""But a lot of work needs to be done.""

As of July 2017, only 14 African countries had dedicated drone regulations, according to an African Union report

But Mbuya stresses that often these regulations are too restrictive and exorbitant licensing fees can price local startups and operators out of the market.

He adds that if drone technology is going to change Africa, Africans have to be able to enter business using the technology and profit.

Idrissi agrees that drone technology and startups should be homegrown.

256061bdf2a54bcaae40657874e66f10	['Atika Shubert']	2018-09-25 00:00:00	German abuse survivors say Church's $5,900 'recognition fee' is not justice	https://www.cnn.com/	US	German abuse survivors say Church's $5,900 'recognition fee' is not justice	1	"Fulda, Germany (CNN) Matthias Katsch says he was 13 years old when a priest at his Jesuit school in Berlin first molested him. His grades suffered and the priest pushed him to have extra tutoring with his teaching colleague, another priest.

This man, Katsch says, stripped him naked in the school music room, bent him over the piano bench and beat him in a sadistic ritual that was repeated multiple times over the next year.

""I thought there might be more boys like me but I always thought I was the only one with a second abuser. It was a terrible shame for me,"" says Katsch, now 55 and a campaigner seeking justice for victims of abuse in the Catholic Church.

""But I was shocked to find out that I was not the only one. There were many victims that experienced exactly the same grooming. That's when I realized this was systematic.""

In 2010, Katsch went public with his story, triggering an outpouring of testimony from dozens, then hundreds of other survivors.

On Tuesday, the German Bishops' Conference released the results of its own report into sexual abuse in the Catholic Church over the past seven decades.

The numbers are staggering: ""at least"" 3,677 people have been abused at the hands of more than 1,600 priests and other members of the clergy.

More than half the victims were under 14, as Katsch was at the time, and most of them were boys.

Speaking during the first day of the German Bishops' Conference in Fulda, central Germany, on Tuesday, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, its chairman, described the findings as ""shameful.""

""We are always shocked and deeply shaken that this happened inside our Church -- and is still possible today -- committed by priests and clergy, the people of God. Those who were given the task to watch over people. We must look at this again and again. We have addressed this before. But we must do more.""

But Katsch is doubtful that this report truly reveals the full scale of the crimes committed. The report covers the ""absolute bare minimum"" of cases voluntarily reported by individual parishes, Katsch says, adding that he believes the real number of victims may be 10 times that many.

""For the survivors, the urgency is we want to know the truth now. We have waited for such a long time, we want it now,"" Katsch says.

He also believes the Church must address the issue of what the German Bishops' Conference calls ""material benefits for recognition of suffering.""

""The average payment to a survivor is 3,000 euros ($3,500). And yet the German Church is the richest Church in the world. It's ridiculous. And they know it.""

Members of the German Bishops' Conference at the opening Mass of the conference on September 25 in the city of Fulda in central Germany.

While it is unclear exactly where the German Church ranks on the global Catholic rich list, it is undeniably extremely wealthy -- far more so than the Vatican.

Last year, Germany's Catholic Church raked in $7.5 billion thanks to its 19th-century ""church tax"" alone, and it's expected to surpass that number this year.

In 2016, the wealthiest dioceses of Paderborn, Munich and Cologne together declared more than $13 billion in assets, from real estate to stocks, far more than the Vatican's estimated $8 billion

Germany isn't the only country to impose a church tax -- Austria, Denmark and Sweden do as well -- but it does charge the highest rate.

If you are a registered Catholic, 8% to 9% of your income goes to the Catholic Church , according to German law. The same applies to other denominations, including the Protestant Lutheran Church. In the last census , 30% of Germans were registered as Catholic -- that's nearly 24 million people, far more than any other faith or denomination.

The only way under the law to avoid the tax is by officially renouncing your faith, effectively barring you from receiving any religious service such as weddings or baptisms.

The German's Bishops' Conference estimates that only one-third of German Catholics actually pay the tax but that still accounts for more than 80% of the Church's vast income.

While the Church spends considerable sums on charitable endeavors -- from education to care for the elderly -- and, taken together with the Protestant Church, is the second largest employer in Germany after the government, a number of flagrant examples of overspending has shaken trust in the institution.

In 2014, Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst of Limburg was removed from his post after an inquiry revealed he had spent more than $40 million on a renovation of his official residence, complete with walk-in closets and designer bathtubs.

Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst's official residence in Limburg was the subject of a financial inquiry.

The scandal earned him the nickname ""Bishop Bling Bling"" and he was swiftly recalled to the Vatican by Pope Francis.

Since then, the German Bishops' Conference has made a concerted effort to increase transparency, publishing annual financial statements for each diocese. But that is not enough for some critics of the Church.

""It's not transparent whatsoever,"" says Christian Weisner, of the Catholic reform group ""Wir sind Kirche"" (""We are church"").

""The church appears transparent because it publishes financial information online. But these figures are very general and vague. When you look closely, you can't see exactly how the money is spent.""

CNN asked the German Bishops' Conference how it calculates how much an abuse survivor should receive in ""recognition of suffering"" and was referred to their website, which states that a victim of sexual abuse could receive ""up to 5,000 euros"" with exceptional arrangements for ""particularly serious cases.""

Katsch is frustrated by the amount and the unrepentant language used to describe the payments.

""The Church paid me a recognition fee of 5,000 euros ($5,900),"" he says. ""They don't call it compensation. And I don't call it compensation either.""

For many survivors like Katsch, what matters most is discovering the truth. He says he received a ""recognition"" payment of 5,000 euros from the German Catholic Church only after one of his alleged attackers confessed to abusing multiple children.

""They call it a recognition fee? Well, thank you very much, but that's not what I want,"" Katsch says. ""I want justice."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180925102555-03-german-bishops-conference-0925-super-tease.jpg

The report -- commissioned by the German Bishops' Conference and conducted by the Universities of Giessen, Heidelberg and Mannheim -- has taken four years to assemble and will be released in full on September 25.

According to both media outlets, the study says the victims were mostly boys, more than half of whom were aged 13 or younger. Every sixth case involved a rape and at least 1,670 clergy were involved, the report also reveals.

""We know the extent of the sexual abuse that has been demonstrated by the study. We are dismayed and ashamed by it,"" Bishop Stephan Ackermann said in a written statement to CNN responding to reports of the leak.

Ackermann said in the statement that the aim of the study was to ""gain more clarity and transparency about this dark side of our church, for the sake of those affected, but also to see for ourselves the wrongdoings and to ensure this cannot be repeated.""

There had been widespread criticism of the deal to move Hans-Georg Maassen from his position as head of the Office of Constitutional Protection, which monitors extremist organizations, to State Secretary in the Interior Ministry, a role that came with with security responsibilities.

The outrage triggered new discussions between the three key figures in the ruling coalition -- Chancellor Angela Merkel, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, and Social Democrats leader Andrea Nahles over the weekend.

According to a government statement Sunday night, Maassen will still make the move to the Interior Ministry, but will become a special adviser in European and international affairs, a position in the same pay grade as his former role as intelligence chief.

The botched handling of Maassen's move has raised serious questions over the competence and stability of the coalition, which was cobbled together in January.

Speaking Monday, Merkel admitted that promoting Maassen was an error of judgment and that she had been more focused on ensuring a functioning Interior Ministry than on the concerns of the public.

""I very much regret that that could happen,"" she said.

Maassen is accused of questioning the validity of a video showing far-right protesters apparently chasing migrants without any evidence to support his claim, and therefore legitimizing attempts by far-right groups to downplay the violence in the eastern city of Chemnitz last month. He later backtracked, saying he had been misunderstood.

The government response to Maassen's comments was widely criticized, as was his promotion last week, which was seen as a victory for Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union, the more conservative sister party to Merkel's Christian Democrats, and staunch defender of Maassen.

Florian Post, SPD lawmaker in Bavaria, described the decision to promote Maassen as a ""joke,"" while Families Minister and SPD lawmaker Franziska Giffey condemned the move and called for Seehofer to go, according to Reuters

Pressure to renegotiate Maassen's relocation was strongest on Nahles, who has been leader of the SPD for just five months. Calls for Maassen to go had been the loudest within her party.

Speaking late Sunday, Nahles said it was a ""very good sign"" that the government was able to respond to the criticism and ""correct"" the decision.

Hans-Georg Maassen, who will soon take up a new position in the Interior Ministry, arrives for a public hearing in Berlin on September 12.

Public prosecutor: Video is genuine

The main allegation against Maassen relates to his comments about a viral video appearing to show protesters hounding migrants during a violent right-wing demonstration in the eastern city of Chemnitz last month. The protests were triggered by the death of Daniel Hillig and subsequent arrests of an Iraqi and a Syrian man. The Iraqi man has since been released from custody, Chemnitz prosecutor said last week.

In an interview with tabloid newspaper Bild, Maassen claimed the video could have been faked and cast doubt on widespread reports that some protesters in Chemnitz had ""hunted"" migrants, putting him at odds with Merkel who had said the pictures ""very clearly revealed hate"" that could not be tolerated.

The Dresden public prosecutor also said the video clip was genuine and was investigating a criminal complaint based on the footage, while several media outlets claimed to have authenticated the video.

Maassen's comments, which were praised by the far-right Alternative for Germany party -- some of whose politicians had joined the Chemnitz protests -- were widely seen as an attempt to downplay the growing problem of right-wing violence in eastern Germany and legitimize anger towards the media.

Following days of pressure, Maassen admitted that the video had not been falsified and that his comments had been misunderstood, according German media reports.

Maassen said he had meant to express doubt about whether the video genuinely showed people being chased, the papers wrote. He denies accusations of showing favor to the far right and the AfD in his comments relating to Chemnitz and in holding meetings with AfD politicians."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180918123637-01-hans-georg-maassen-file-super-tease.jpg
00bce1eb5085431d9c3ec3cbf01d02ae	['Daniel Burke', 'Cnn Religion Editor']	2018-09-23 00:00:00	The silent Popes: Why Francis and Benedict won't answer the accusations dividing their church	https://www.cnn.com/	US	The silent Popes: Why Francis and Benedict won't answer the accusations dividing their church	1	"(CNN) One rarely leaves his monastery high on a hill in Vatican City. The other speaks freely -- too freely, critics say -- but has vowed silence on this matter, for now.

Two men, both clad in white, both called Holy Father, and now, both facing questions about a crucial facet of the Catholic Church's sexual abuse crisis: What did they know, and when?

Amid the onslaught of news about the scandal, it can be easy to overlook the historical novelty and high drama of this moment in the life of the church: For the first time in 600 years, there are two living popes, one retired and one active, whose fates may be intertwined, even as many of their followers are at odds.

It has been nearly a month since a former papal diplomat published a dramatic letter asserting a ""homosexual networks"" and widespread cover-ups within the highest levels of the Catholic Church.

The diplomat, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, demanded that Pope Francis resign for allegedly lifting sanctions that his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, had placed on an American cardinal accused of sexual misconduct.

Whether those sanctions actually existed is a question that Francis and Benedict seem uniquely qualified to answer. But neither the 91-year-old German scholar, nor the 81-year-old Argentine Jesuit has said a word about them.

Supporters of both popes cast their silence in spiritual terms, forms of discipline and faith that truth will be revealed, eventually. Others say Benedict and Francis are loath to descend into a mudslinging fight with a former employee. Some wonder if more mundane strategies may be at work, too, such as self-preservation.

Meanwhile, many Catholics are clamoring for answers, anxious that the scandal, with its many troubling questions, could irreparably mar the church's moral reputation and undermine trust in its leaders.

Since Benedict's abdication in 2013, the two popes have taken pains to avoid awkward images or public spats.

But in the United States and beyond, Benedict is held by conservatives as a life raft in a sea of moral relativism. Francis is beloved by liberals for his reform-mindedness, focus on poverty and openness to new ideas. While many American Catholics still like Francis, his popularity has plummeted in the last year, according to a recent CNN poll

""Maybe some people ... are not very happy with Pope Francis, so they dream about"" Benedict, Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the Pope's current ambassador to the United States, said at an event Wednesday in New York.

""At times our feelings are overwhelming, so instead of looking at reality as it is, you know, we judge reality from our own feelings, our resentments, our disappointments. And so, we say, 'This Pope, I don't understand him,' and we dream about the other.""

The sex abuse scandal has exacerbated tensions between the two camps as both fight for high moral ground. Francis and Benedict know everything they say can be twisted and used in those skirmishes, friends and advisers say, and are mindful of mistakes they've made in the past.

So, while their factions fight online, both popes have kept their silence about Vigano.

Theories and inter-church debates have rushed into the vacuum, to many survivors' dismay. Clergy celibacy, homosexuality, seminary culture, even liturgy have been conscripted into left-right debates about the true source of the church's troubles.

But many Catholics are urging him to be more forthcoming about Vigano's accusations. More than 46,000 Catholic women have signed an open letter to Francis, writing ""to pose questions that need answers.""

""We need leadership, truth and transparency,"" the women wrote. ""We, your flock, deserve your answers now.""

Other Catholics say Benedict is the pope who has questions to answer.

Vigano's accusations

The chief accusation against Francis comes from Vigano, who served both Benedict and Pope Francis as nuncio, or papal ambassador, to the United States from 2011 to 2016.

Francis has said he fired Vigano for plotting a 2015 meeting with Kim Davis , the Kentucky clerk who became a conservative cause célèbre for refusing to sign same-sex marriage licenses.

In an 11-page letter published August 25, Vigano tore into his former Vatican colleagues, accusing them of turning a blind eye to ""homosexual networks"" within the church, according to the archbishop.

Vigano's chief evidence of this secret Catholic subculture comes in the person of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick , the former Archbishop of Washington, who was forced to resign this summer over accusations that he molested an altar boy and sexually abused young seminarians.

JUST WATCHED Pope accepts resignation of prominent cardinal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pope accepts resignation of prominent cardinal 01:40

Now 88, McCarrick has denied the allegation about the altar boy and appealed his case to the Vatican after an investigation by the Archdiocese of New York found the accusation credible. He has not responded to the accusations about the seminarians.

For years, reports about McCarrick's misconduct with seminarians passed through the hands of powerful cardinals and archbishops, who apparently did nothing about them, according to Vigano. McCarrick himself was made a cardinal in 2001.

Finally, Vigano says, in 2009 or 2010 Pope Benedict XVI placed ""canonical sanctions"" on McCarrick, ordering him to live a life of prayer and penance away from the public eye.

But those sanctions have come under sharp questioning. Photographs and videos show McCarrick hobnobbing with church leaders, including Benedict and Vigano himself, at high-profile church events while the sanctions were supposedly in place.

The website that published Vigano's letter, National Catholic Register , now says the sanctions were not a ""formal decree, just a private request"" by Benedict to McCarrick.

If the sanctions were a ""private request,"" Francis' supporters say, how was he supposed to enforce them?

Vigano's agenda has also been questioned. In addition to the Davis fiasco, he has aligned himself with conservatives opposed to aspects of Francis' papacy, including his efforts to change elements of church teachings.

But some allegations in Vigano's letter appear to be backed by documents, including a newly unearthed letter from a top Vatican official indicating that Catholic leaders had known about McCarrick's alleged misconduct with seminarians since 2000.

In the United States, conservative bishops have vouched for Vigano's character and called for an investigation of his allegations about McCarrick. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops had asked the Vatican to lead the probe, with its leadership traveling to Rome last week to make the request in person.

In a statement Wednesday, the bishops' conference said it still supports an investigation but made no mention of the Vatican.

The Vatican has not responded to requests for comment about a potential investigation into McCarrick.

'He is trying to save the church'

On the day Vigano's accusations broke, the Pope was asked about them on the plane ride home from Ireland.

""I will not say a single word about this,"" he said. ""I believe the statement speaks for itself. And you have the journalistic capacity to draw your own conclusions. It's an act of faith. When some time passes and you have drawn your conclusions, I may speak.""

Next Tuesday, the Pope will again face reporters, on a papal flight back from a four-day visit to the Baltic states.

While Francis has kept silent about Vigano so far, Pierre, his new ambassador, offered a glimpse of how the Pope may be approaching this situation.

Much has already been written and said about the Pope's Jesuit background -- perhaps too much, joked Pierre, ribbing his hosts, the Jesuit-run America Media, at Wednesday's event in Manhattan.

""They think they know everything, the Jesuits,"" Pierre said with a laugh.

But ""discernment,"" a key part of Jesuit spirituality, plays an important role in Francis' life, the nuncio said. Discernment, as described in the Jesuits' Spiritual Exercises , is a way to contemplate complex situations and make sound decisions.

""It's the capacity to analyze the situation in the light of Christ and the Spirit,"" Pierre said.

Pierre said he saw Francis put discernment into practice while traveling with him through Mexico, where the nuncio was previously stationed.

""He is discerning all the time. He's in touch with reality. He has no idea already-made before he sees things.""

""Maybe Providence is working in that,"" Pierre continued, ""to have chosen somebody who has this capacity, this experience and this patrimony of the Jesuits and the Spiritual Exercises, precisely to guide the church in this difficult time.""

One of the Pope's closest confidants, the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, said the Pope sees the Vigano letter as part of a conservative campaign to disrupt his papacy, and "" draws energy from the conflict.

Still, Francis has acknowledged errors in his handling of clergy sex abuse.

After dismissing allegations against a bishop accused of cover-ups, the Pope in April said he had made ""serious mistakes in the assessment and perception"" of Chile's abuse scandal. The Pope later accepted that bishop's resignation , along with several other Chilean bishops.

""He knows that he has made big mistakes on this, and he realizes that they were bad judgments, and now he wants to be cautious about not making the same mistakes,"" said Massimo Faggioli, a professor of church history at Villanova University in Philadelphia.

Francis also likely sees Vigano's accusations as part of a larger problem within the church: Catholic bishops face sexual misconduct allegations on several different continents right now.

(On Wednesday, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops announced new policies to police bishops, including a hotline to field complaints.)

""I believe that Francis is trying to do something bigger than defend himself,"" Faggioli said. ""He is trying to save the church.

""The problem is that the real person who should respond to Vigano's letter is not Francis,"" the professor continued. ""It's Benedict.""

The 'private' Pope

Since retiring in 2013, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI has lived a quiet, almost cloistered life. Now 91, friends say that he is frail but mentally sharp.

In his farewell address as Pope, Benedict promised to stay ""hidden"" from the world, even as he knew his unique personal history would make a complete disappearance nearly impossible.

Private letters between Benedict and a German cardinal published last week in Germany reveal his concern for privacy, and that he not be seen as interfering in church matters.

In one letter, Benedict defends his decision to resign, when he became the first Pope in 600 years to abdicate St. Peter's Throne.

""With 'pope emeritus,' I tried to create a situation in which I am absolutely not accessible to the media and in which it is completely clear that there is only one pope,"" he wrote.

But Benedict's decision to retire as ""pope emeritus"" has had its own complications. Some conservative Catholics look to him as an anti-Pope, or at least an anti-Francis.

The Rev. Joseph Fessio, an American Jesuit who studied under Benedict and has published his works at Ignatius Press, said the former Pope likely knows of the efforts to pit him against Francis.

""In some ways, he has become the face of 'the Resistance,' "" Fessio said, ""even though he hasn't done anything to be a resistor.""

When Benedict does make public remarks, conservatives often scour them for hints of unhappiness at the church's current situation, or leader.

In the piece, the author argues that Benedict's praise of a deceased cardinal's faith in the church, that he held faith in the church ""even if at times the ship is almost filled to the point of shipwreck,"" could be interpreted as a dig at Francis. (The late Cardinal Joachim Meisner had also publicly questioned Francis' decision to open the door for remarried Catholics to receive Communion.)

Benedict's longtime aide, Archbishop Georg Ganswein, called the interpretations of the former Pope's remarks ""stupid."" But Fessio isn't so sure.

""He's got a very wry sense of humor, and he understates things,"" Fessio said. ""He's not going to say, 'The church is a mess under Francis.' But his support for Meisner was a semi-coded message that he is aware of what's going on in the church right now.""

Ganswein has said the former Pope will not comment on Vigano's letter, knocking down reports that he had approved its contents as "" fake news .""

Besides a reluctance to be seen as interfering, Benedict may have other reasons to hold his tongue, some Catholics say.

He was Pope from 2005 to 2013, when much of the alleged misconduct outlined in Vigano's letter took place. Even allies acknowledge that Benedict did not lead the Vatican curia with a firm hand.

""When it comes to Benedict, it's damned if you did, and damned if you didn't,"" said Paul Elie, a Catholic journalist who has written about the relationship between the two popes.

""If Benedict knew about the allegations against McCarrick and didn't put him under sanctions, that's not good,"" Elie said. ""And if Benedict didn't know about the allegations, that's not good either.""

But Fessio and other Catholics say Francis should answer Vigano's charges, instead of making vague remarks about ""scandal"" and ""division"" during morning homilies at Casa Santa Marta, his Roman residence.

""He's attacking Vigano and everyone who is asking for answers,"" Fessio said. ""I just find that deplorable. Be a man. Stand up and answer the questions.""

Many church watchers expect that Francis, or perhaps the Vatican's press office, will eventually, answer Vigano's charges. The question is, when?"	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130323133709-italy-popes-benedict-francis-2-super-tease.jpg
14590fa237bd40c6aba4615b0609c4d9	['Laura Smith-Spark', 'Cnn', 'Photos Sarah Tilotta']	2018-09-21 00:00:00	Fruit farmers feel the squeeze as Brexit looms	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Fruit farmers feel the squeeze as Brexit looms	1	"Coxheath, England (CNN) The workers traveled purposefully down the polytunnels, hands moving swiftly as they plucked plump raspberries and blackberries from the canes. Any delay means less pay.

It's hard work. But the picking teams at Clock House Farm, in southeast England, have traveled more than 1,000 miles to be there, leaving family and friends behind.

Why do they come? ""For money,"" said Romanian picker Alin Florea succinctly. ""It's double or more what I would get at home.""

Picker Alin Florea, who's been coming to Clock House Farm for eight years, says this may be his last season.

He's worked at Clock House Farm for the past eight summers. But, the 29-year-old said, it's not easy saying goodbye to his family, including a 2-year-old daughter, for four months at a time and this year could be his last. Back home, he works as a driver or window fitter.

Farm owner Robert Pascall said he's managed to get enough pickers this year, with 550 signed up, most of them Romanian. ""It's been a bit touch and go and quite expensive recruitment -- and obviously we've seen quite significant wage inflation because it just has been difficult to get people,"" he said.

Over 30 years Pascall has seen his business, located an hour southeast of London, expand from 200 to 1,000 acres as he's taken over struggling farms nearby.

With the advantage of scale, he can compete. But a tiny operating profit margin leaves his business vulnerable to increasing labor costs.

Robert Pascall relies on pickers from Romania and Bulgaria to harvest fruit on his farm.

Feeling the squeeze

Across the European Union, seasonal agricultural workers are at a premium. Most come from the eastern European nations that have most recently entered the bloc -- particularly Romania and Bulgaria -- but as economic conditions in their home countries improve, the number willing to travel elsewhere in Europe for short-term manual work is dwindling.

Germany's agricultural sector relies heavily on seasonal workers, with 180,000 Romanians and 100,000 Poles employed in 2016. In the face of falling numbers, some farmers and politicians called in German media reports this year for Ukrainians also to be allowed in.

Spain already employs thousands of seasonal workers from Morocco to harvest its crops, particularly strawberries. A spokesman for Spain's employment ministry confirmed that married women with children are preferred because they are considered most likely to return home when their contracts end.

And in Portugal, thousands of seasonal agricultural workers are recruited from as far afield as Asia and Africa, according to the Confederation of Portuguese Farmers, as well as from non-EU European nations such as Ukraine and Moldova.

Meanwhile, Poland -- itself a source of migrant labor for some wealthier European nations -- now brings in workers from non-EU neighbor Ukraine to meet its own labor needs, according to data from the Kiev-based think tank Centre for Economic Strategy.

Britain, which according to the National Farmers' Union employs 60,000 seasonal workers in the horticulture sector each year, does not currently allow in seasonal agricultural workers from outside the EU. And it is feeling the squeeze.

There's a 10% shortfall in such workers so far in 2018, according to NFU figures released last month, following a 12.5% shortfall in workers recruited by labor providers for 2017.

A picker moves down a Clock House Farm polytunnel.

After many months of lobbying by farmers' groups, the UK government earlier this month announced a two-year pilot program to bring up to 2,500 non-EU migrant workers a year to work on British farms for up to six months. Agricultural bodies widely welcomed the news -- but pointed out it was only a small step toward what is needed.

The British Growers Association has welcomed the Government's initiative on seasonal labour in principle, but points out that the pilot scheme falls well short of the numbers of labourers required to sustain the fresh produce industry in Britain. https://t.co/XZNRhz3ABY — British Growers (@BritishGrowers) September 7, 2018

""Our farms are reporting staff shortages of 10%-20% already, and to have any effect in terms of supporting our successful industry ... around 10,000 are needed now -- not 2,500,"" said Nick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits, an industry body for soft fruit growers.

""At least the powers that be are at last taking a bit of notice,"" said Pascall. ""Basically, the industry, or the government, has a choice: either exporting the industry or importing the labor. There's no alternative.""

Pascall's farm provides soft fruit to the major UK supermarkets.

There's a lot at stake. Soft fruit production in the UK has grown by 130% in the past 20 years, according to government figures. If workers can't be found to pick Britain's strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries, farmers must reduce what they plant or risk seeing precious crops rot.

While it's far from the only factor at play, Brexit has not helped. The fall in the value of the pound since Britain voted to leave the EU means wages offered by British farmers are less tempting than those elsewhere in Europe.

There's also wide uncertainty over the future status of EU seasonal workers after Britain exits the bloc next March.

As fraught negotiations with Brussels continue, the prospect of a potential no-deal Brexit has prompted dire warnings of food shortages, among other issues, and a renewed focus on self-sufficiency.

Blackberries ripen in a polytunnel.

Pinch-point month

The UK's peak picking season runs from May to November, with the earlier months dominated by soft fruit and the later ones by so-called top fruit, such as apples and pears.

September, when both soft and top fruit need picking but many workers are ready to return home, is a particular pinch point.

Romanian workers stack trays of juicy raspberries.

According to the NFU's labor providers' survey, about half the seasonal agricultural workforce is resident in the UK, while the remainder travel there for work and then go home. Two-thirds come from Romania and Bulgaria, which became EU members in 2007, with just over a fifth from eight eastern European nations that joined the EU in 2004, Poland among them.

Only 1% of the sector's seasonal workers are native to the UK, where unemployment currently stands at a 40-year low.

Ali Capper, who chairs the NFU horticulture board and runs a West Midlands farm producing apples and hops, has worked hard to recruit British workers this year, including placing ads in local newspapers and colleges.

Apple farmer Ali Capper fears a no-deal Brexit could be ""potentially catastrophic"" for Britain's horticultural sector.

As a result, she has managed to sign up six UK workers. ""It's an unprecedented number but also an effort, all of which adds to our cost and workload,"" she told CNN.

Capper fears the impact of a no-deal Brexit next March. ""It's potentially catastrophic. The sector requires 60,000 seasonal workers for about 80,000 seasonal roles,"" she said.

She wants a program brought in to recruit non-EU workers that would help Britain compete with other European nations.

Britain operated such a program from the end of World War II until late 2013. It was phased out when restrictions on the free movement of Bulgarians and Romanians were lifted.

By 2016, Capper says, farmers were starting to see significant labor shortages -- a situation that has worsened. Last year, a lack of pickers cost her own business, Stocks Farm, about £30,000 when good apples had to be sent for juice because they were harvested too late, she said.

Pickers say they travel from Romania because they can earn a lot more than at home.

'I've never known it like this'

Amid stiff competition to attract pickers, farms are now paying seasonal workers a higher wage, upgrading their accommodation and offering end-of-season bonuses.

""It's not unusual for (seasonal workers) to be paid between £12 and £15 an hour,"" said Capper. The current national minimum wage in Britain for workers aged 25 and over is £7.83, with lower rates paid to younger workers.

Meanwhile, the profile of the pickers has changed, Capper said. Whereas before they were often young, fit students who wanted to improve their English, recruits are now generally older, less well educated and less productive. Labor agencies increasingly have to travel to rural areas of the EU to find workers, she added, hence the focus on Romania and Bulgaria.

A key factor in the changing profile of recruits is the strengthening of Romania and Bulgaria's own economies. The former, with a population close to 20 million, enjoyed 6.9% growth in gross domestic product last year, according to European Commission forecasts, while GDP in Bulgaria, with about 7 million people, grew by 3.6%.

A Romanian picker wheels trays of raspberries past one of Pascall's polytunnels.

As economic conditions improve, workers' options are changing. ""People we've had for some years are being offered almost the same back there as we can offer here,"" said Pascall. ""And there is where they would rather be.""

Meanwhile, farmers in Britain increasingly have to contend with pickers who don't turn up as promised, are less motivated to work or leave sooner than expected, Capper said. Two of the 20 workers she recruited from Poland this year didn't show up.

""The big hurdle is, we are talking about seasonal roles which in order to have year-round work means people have to move around the country, which just doesn't suit the aspirations of any 'First World' country,"" said Capper.

""Other countries in the EU are recruiting from outside because there aren't enough workers in the EU.""

Amid the uncertainties over future labor supply and Brexit, some British soft fruit farmers are developing interests in other EU countries and further afield, said Capper, including China, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. Others are delaying investment decisions at home, she said. ""We just don't know if we are going to have access to the people we need to pick the crop.""

Stocks Farm has been in her husband's family since 1962. ""Times now are the most challenging we've seen,"" said Capper. ""I've never known it like this.""

'Just got to get on with it'

Meanwhile, Pascall is determined to do all he can to keep his seasonal workers coming back -- he currently has a 65% return rate. The farm's website is translated into both Romanian and Bulgarian. He plans to send newsletters during the winter to foster ties with this season's pickers.

The farm's permanent staff include Romanian nationals who first came for a summer but stayed on and rose through the ranks. Having been resident in Britain for several years, they shouldn't be affected by Brexit.

Anna Maria Petcu fears Brexit will make it harder for seasonal workers like her to come to Britain.

Picking team leader Alexandru Gitlan, 27, from the southeastern Romanian city of Calarasi, is one of those. He doesn't believe the situation in Romania has improved enough for workers to stop coming.

Anna Maria Petcu, 26, also from Calarasi, recently finished a college course in management and is working her third season at the farm. ""I want to find something in Romania but I don't know what I will find,"" she said. She fears Brexit will make it more difficult for workers like her to come to Britain.

Bogdan Dumitra, 33, from the southern Romanian city of Craiova, is in his eighth season at Clock House Farm and heads another of the picking teams. He and his fiancée, also a picker, will marry in two months when they return to Romania.

""It is hard moving back and forward,"" says Romanian team leader Bogdan Dumitra, from the southwestern city of Craiova.

Dumitra keeps coming back for the money, he said. At home, he works in a hospital but earns less. ""It is hard moving back and forward,"" he said.

Things have changed since the Brexit vote, Dumitra added. ""It is a bit different but it's still OK for us. It's just the political atmosphere.""

So long as Pascall can keep his pickers coming, he sees opportunities in Brexit. If the value of the pound falls, homegrown produce becomes more appealing. The government may step in to soften any blow to British growers, he said, and new markets could open up.

""I think we've just got to get on with it and make it successful,"" he said."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180915110902-01-clock-house-farm-super-tease.jpg

May struck a defiant tone during a Downing Street statement in which she called for the EU to ""respect"" the British position and the result of the June 2016 referendum.

A day after returning from the summit in Salzburg, Austria, she called on the EU to spell out its objections to her plan or come up with an alternative.

""Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it,"" May said.

Downing Street had hoped the informal Salzburg summit would pave the way to a resolution of outstanding issues in Brexit talks before a formal meeting in October. Instead, the leaders of the 27 remaining EU nations were unexpectedly resolute in their opposition to the UK leader's proposals.

Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said key aspects of the plan, agreed at the Prime Minister's Chequers country retreat in July, "" will not work "" in their current form.

French President Emmanuel Macron went even further, saying that the entire Brexit project was sold to the British people by ""liars"" who immediately fled the stage, unwilling to see their project through.

In her Downing Street statement, May refused to budge and said the ball was in the EU's court. ""At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side's proposals without a detailed explanation and counterproposals,"" she said.

""So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress. In the meantime, we must and will continue the work of preparing ourselves for no deal.""

Tusk trolls May

May appeared bruised by the reception she got in Salzburg, and sounded particularly withering when referring to the European Council president. ""Yesterday Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market. He didn't explain how in any detail or make any counterproposal. So we are at an impasse,"" she said.

Tusk drew attention Thursday for an Instagram post in which he appeared to troll May. An image of Tusk offering pastries to May is captioned: ""A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries.""

The EU side has repeatedly accused Britain of wanting to ""have its cake and eat it"" and of cherry-picking as it seeks to keep elements of the single market it likes and ditch others it doesn't.

Conservative lawmaker Charlie Elphicke condemned Tusk's post as ""extraordinarily disrespectful.""

In a statement Friday evening, Tusk said he ""remained convinced that a compromise, good for all is still possible"" and called the UK a close friend, adding he was a ""true admirer of PM May.""

Speaking earlier Friday, May said the two sides remained ""a long way apart"" but insisted the British ""stand ready"" to work on resolving the issues.

The main sticking point continues to be how to handle the border between Northern Ireland, which will remain part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, which will continue to be part of the EU. Neither side wants an arrangement that would require the rebuilding of border infrastructure, the removal of which was a key part of the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland after years of sectarian strife.

May, whose Chequers plan proposes a common rulebook on goods and services to ensure that no customs checks are needed, insisted that creating any form of customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK was unacceptable.

""It is something I will never agree to -- indeed, in my judgment it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to,"" she said. ""If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake. Anything which fails to respect the referendum or which effectively divides our country in two would be a bad deal, and I have always said no deal is better than a bad deal.""

Troubles at home

Amid the uncertainty over the negotiations, May has been plagued by outspoken criticism from members of her own Conservative Party, in particular from ardent supporters of Brexit, who believe she has not been tough enough with the EU.

May will hope that her tough stance against the EU will insulate her from further criticism ahead of the Conservatives' annual conference, which begins September 30.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the powerful European Research Group, a fervently pro-Brexit caucus of Conservative members of Parliament, praised May for being ""strong and forthright"" in Friday's speech. But he also demanded that she abandon her Chequers plan.

Meanwhile, ""Remain"" supporters have been rallying behind a burgeoning campaign for a new referendum, known as a ""people's vote.""

London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a vocal Brexit opponent, warned May's statement moved the country ""another step closer to the worst possible outcome from the Brexit negotiations -- a catastrophic 'no deal' that would hammer jobs and economic growth.""

Khan, a member of the opposition Labour Party, urged the Prime Minister to change course. ""Passing the buck to the EU to save her skin will not work,"" he said."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180921082337-02-theresa-may-eu-summit-super-tease.jpg

About 1,000 members of the army, police and fire services were on Friday battling the blaze, covering around eight square kilometers near Meppen, a town in northwest Germany close to the border with the Netherlands, the armed forces said in a statement

The fire began on September 3 following two rocket tests, the statement said. The risk of fire was assessed before the tests and firefighting equipment was on hand, but the vehicle used to extinguish fires broke down on the way to a second outbreak, giving the embers time to spread deeper into the boggy surface of the moor.

The area affected is the equivalent of about 1,000 soccer fields, according to the armed forces.

A sign reads, ""Stop! Artillery range, danger to life"" as smoke from the moor fire rises into the sky.

Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, said key aspects of Brexit proposals presented by May ""will not work"" in their current form.

Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, said there could be ""no compromise"" on the integrity of the single market, the bloc's economic free-trade zone.

Emmanuel Macron, the French President, was harshest of all. The entire Brexit project was sold to the British people by ""liars"" who immediately fled the stage, unwilling to see their project through.

May could be forgiven for looking like thunder at her post-summit press conference. But she showed no sign of backing down from the proposals hashed out with her Cabinet at her country retreat of Chequers in July -- so controversial with her own party that they provoked the resignation of her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and Brexit secretary, David Davis.

She acknowledged that a bilateral meeting with Tusk was ""frank."" But Chequers was the only game in town, she told reporters. That plan ""remains the only serious and credible proposition on the table,"" she said.

French President Emmanuel Macron, second left, speaks with European Council President Donald Tusk, left, as Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, right, and British Prime Minister Theresa May, enter the room.

If the language coming out of EU leaders was anything to go by, the prospect the UK crashing out without a deal seems greater than ever. ""Everybody shared the view that while there are positive elements in the Chequers proposal for economic cooperation, the suggested framework will not work -- not least because it risks undermining the single market,"" Tusk told reporters.

The main sticking point continues to be how to handle the border between Northern Ireland, which will remain part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, which will continue to be part of the EU. Neither side wants an arrangement that would require the rebuilding of border infrastructure, the removal of which was a key part of the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland after years of sectarian strife.

May promised to bring forward new proposals that would ensure trade could move freely across the Irish border, but would not require different customs regimes in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, a key red line for the British Prime Minister.

'Moment of truth'

EU leaders will meet again at a formal summit in October, which Tusk called ""the moment of truth"" for Brexit negotiations. Under the EU process that governs Britain's withdrawal, the UK leaves the bloc on March 29, 2019 -- deal or no deal. In practice, to allow for parliamentary ratification, that means a deal must be struck in the next couple of months.

It's clear that significant gaps remain between both sides. ""The Irish question needs something more than only good intentions,"" Tusk said. ""Without clear a precise solution to the Irish question, and for the whole context of our economic future relations, it will be difficult even to imagine a positive process after October,"" Tusk said.

May said that leaving with no deal remains an option. ""There's a lot of hard work to be done, I believe there is a willingness to do a deal,"" May said. But she added: ""We are preparing for no deal. The British people can be confident we have done what is necessary to make sure we have a success of leaving the EU.""

Some leaders expressed deep frustration. Macron acknowledged that Brexit was the choice of the British people but added that it was ""pushed by those who predicted easy solutions.""

""If Brexit tells us one thing... it shows us that those who say: one can do easily without Europe, that it will all go well, that it is easy and will bring lots of money -- are liars,"" Macron said. ""They left the next day so they didn't have to manage it.""

The sour tone at the end of the Salzburg summit could all just be part of the negotiations dance. Both sides want to show a tough face. May faces a rough ride at the Conservative party conference in a few weeks, with challengers to her leadership waiting in the wings.

And EU leaders want to make an example of the UK's pain to any other countries even thinking of leaving: Breaking up is hard to do."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180919182450-eu-dinner-salzburg-super-tease.jpg

This article was published in partnership with Artsy, the global platform for discovering and collecting art. The original article can be seen here

In America, the beloved cartoon character Mickey Mouse has had nearly a century of shows, books, films, amusement parks—and now an upcoming exhibition —to make a lasting impression across generations of children.

But in the USSR., the national treasure Cheburashka, a small, brown, furry creature of unknown origin, was only featured in one book and four short films—a total of 70 minutes over 14 years.

Despite his small footprint, Cheburashka, who was created in 1965 by the recently departed cartoonist Eduard Uspensky, survived the collapse of the Soviet Union and continued to be a beloved icon in Russia -- and, over the decades, he became an international icon, as well. The character has starred in far-flung spinoffs and a major motion picture, been present at political protests, and even had a rocket launcher named after him.

""Ask any person who grew up in the Eastern bloc about 'the Soviet Mickey Mouse' and they will likely break out in song in Cheburashka's cloyingly naïve voice,"" an article in Tablet magazine asserted , repeating the character's song: ""I was once a strange no-name toy, whom no one wanted in the store and now I'm Cheburashka...."" (Note: This writer can confirm her Kazakhstan-born husband has done just this.)

But Cheburashka, who Uspensky called ""a still-undiscovered orangivore animal,"" was an unlikely star. The protagonist of his story was actually a gentleman crocodile named Gena, who wore a red smoking jacket and worked in a zoo (as a crocodile). In the first short film from 1969 , for which Uspensky wrote the screenplay, Cheburashka, a supporting character, was discovered by a fruit-stand owner in a crate of oranges. His name was derived from the archaic Russian verb cheburakhnutsya, which means ""to topple"" -- as he did, when the owner sat him on the edge of the crate, thanks to his trademark oversized head and round ears.

The owner took Cheburashka to the zoo, but after the zookeeper rejected him (saying he didn't know which cage to put him in), he took refuge in a phone booth. Meanwhile, Gena, who was profoundly lonely, had posted a sign seeking a companion. Cheburashka answered, and a friendship was born. The second film, released in 1971, was titled Cheburashka, followed by 1974's Shapoklyak and 1983's Cheburashka Goes to School.

If you visit Russia today, you'll see Cheburashka's image in plush form, as a matryoshka nesting doll, and on T-shirts as ""Che Burashka,"" riffing on the revolutionary Marxist Che Guevara. Bronze statues have been erected in his and Gena's likenesses in the towns of Ramenskoye and Khabarovsk, and Cheburashka was named the official mascot for the Russian Olympic team from 2004 to 2010, for which his brown fur was changed to a more patriotic white, followed by red, then blue.

But Cheburashka's teachings about friendship have reached well beyond former Soviet states, to Europe and East Asia. Uspensky's original 1965 book, Gena the Crocodile and his Friends, has been translated into over 20 languages. Cheburashka is known as Muksis in Finland, Plumps in Germany, and Topple in the UK He's named Drutten in Sweden, where he and Gena starred in a hand-puppet spin-off show in the 1970s and '80s. In Japan, where kawaii (cute) creatures reign, Cheburashka became a cultural phenomenon in the 2000s, inspiring a new Japanese-produced series of shorts in 2009, followed by a full-length feature film in 2010; the latter is part of the Ghibli Museum Library.

Cheburashka's legacy has persisted because of the universality of his message -- where you come from doesn't matter, it's kindness that's important -- but also because of Uspensky's legal smarts. He copyrighted Cheburashka's name and image and sold the rights to other countries, even approving the scripts for the Japanese productions. However, that came with legal hurdles: He and art director Leonid Shvartsman, who reportedly conceptualized Cheburashka's most distinctive features for the original film, took at least one of their heated battles over Cheburashka's image to court.

In addition to his appearance in the Russian court system, Cheburashka has become a political player abroad. Items that resemble his face are often nicknamed Cheburashka—most notably, the An-72 jet -- but that extends to people who bear a likeness, too, such as the former Armenian prime minister Serzh Sargsyan, who resigned in April following a series of national protests that erupted over his bid to retain power. During the protests, Armenians carried dirtied Cheburashka toys, and at least one person lit his aflame, thrusting the burning effigy above his head. In one rousing rally, a protester in full Cheburashka costume took the podium in a satirical performance as Sargsyan.

Less than three months later, in June, Ukraine separatists in the Donetsk People's Republic publicly introduced the multiple-launch rocket system Cheburashka, which had been named as early as 2015, in response to a Russian military rocket launcher named after the Tolstoy adaptation of Pinocchio. The DPR armored vehicle features Cheburashka's likeness in a disturbing manner: Not only is he human-sized and in uniform, he's holding an assault rifle.

That version of Cheburashka is a far cry from Uspensky's original character, which he described as having ""cuteness, heightened fluffiness, and ear-endowment,"" and being ""incredibly energetic despite general cluelessness."" But like his origin, his character has become open to interpretation. Cheburashka has evolved beyond his simple roots to represent national pride, or the apogee of kawaii culture, or political punchlines. But, as with most public figures, the legacy becomes larger than the person. Or, in this case, the furry orangivore."	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180924105157-cheburashka-super-tease.jpg

This story is part of ""Smart Creativity,"" a series exploring the intersection between high-concept design and advanced technology.

Dutch designer Daan Roosegaarde has long explored sustainability issues through eye-catching installations that fuse science, art and design. From smog-eating towers and energy-generating kites to light-emitting bicycle paths, they have all captivated while also suggesting new possibilities for a more environmentally sound future. But ""Waterlicht"" may be his most breathtaking project to date.

The project, which first launched in 2015, sees city centers submerged in a virtual flood of undulating blue waves to raise public awareness about rising sea levels.

The effect is achieved using high-density LED lights, sophisticated software, reflective lenses and steam machines. When the light hits the steam, it creates the illusion of waves.

So far, Roosegaarde's studio has brought his eerie ""dreamscape"" to 10 cities, including London, New York, Paris and Amsterdam, and he's set to take on Toronto and Rotterdam before the year's end.

Haunting virtual floods submerge cities around the world

Roosegaarde believes the projects have the potential not only to educate, but to connect visitors with one another. He recalls that, when 60,000 visitors came to experience ""Waterlicht"" in Amsterdam, ""some were a bit scared because they'd experienced floods. Others were more mesmerized (by) a virtual reality, an augmented reality.""

""But at the same time, it's real, you can touch it, feel it, experience it together,"" he adds. ""Technology jumping out of the computer screen and creating these collective experiences: That, I think, is the true power of tech.""

This story is part of ""Smart Creativity,"" a series exploring the intersection between high-concept design and advanced technology.

In mid-August, just after sunset, the skies over Amsterdam were lit by a swarm of 300 glowing drones moving through the night in a tightly choreographed spectacle.

The eye-catching display, titled ""Franchise Freedom,"" was the work of Studio Drift , an Amsterdam-based art studio helmed by Lonneke Gordijn and Ralph Nauta. Since 2007, the duo has made its name with striking, often light-based installations that explore the relationship between nature and technology.

""(Technology is) an evolution from nature,"" Nauta said. ""It's just the canvas that we work with. The canvas and the paint. It helps us to express what we want to achieve.

""Franchise Freedom,"" which debuted at Art Basel Miami Beach last December, was an attempt to recreate murmuration, a phenomenon that sees massive flocks of birds flying in coordinated patterns through the sky. While following their own paths, each bird contributes to the larger shape formed by the flock.

To bring the concept to life, Studio Drift had to call on tech specialists.

""We talked to certain parties, like (the electronic parts distributor) ARS Electronics, and we motivated them to (research) the centralized steering of a group of drones that you can program to do different kinds of movements in the sky. Then, at a certain point, Intel got involved in the research and developed the hardware to create these sculptures,"" Nauta said.

""Of course, when you see a piece of hardware on the floor, it doesn't do anything. But when you have 300 swarming before you, it really becomes a living entity.""

Each 'hive' can accommodate four astronauts and can be 3D-printed in situ using a static construction rover and materials gathered from the surface of the Red Planet, including basalt and renewable bioplastic. Marsha's vertical design alleviates Mars' atmospheric constraints by minimising movement of the construction rover across unfamiliar terrain, allowing it to print while static.

Explains the practice: 'Where structures on earth are designed primarily for gravity and wind, special conditions on Mars point to a structure optimized to handle internal atmospheric pressure and structural stresses: a vertical container with a minimal footprint.'

The cylindrical dwellings comprise an outer shell, which is tethered to the surface of the planet (to guard against strong winds), and an internal shell which houses living spaces. These are set across four levels, with a wet lab on the lower level, kitchen and dry lab above, and the top two floors for recreation. Bedrooms are conceived as semi-enclosed sleeping pods that offer privacy.

The Bartini Beriev VVA-14 (above) is one of the most bizarre airplanes ever made. It could take off vertically and land on the water, and it was designed to search and destroy US submarines during the Cold War.

After its first flight from a regular runway in 1972, parts were added to make it amphibious. It could fly low on the water, skimming the surface while patrolling for targets. Part space ship, part hydrofoil, it didn't exactly look elegant in flight , but it was packed with technical achievements.

Following the death of its inventor, Italian-born engineer Robert Bartini, in 1974, the project was abandoned. The VVA-14 only racked up about 100 flight hours and just two prototypes were built. The only surviving one now sits in an airfield at the Central Air Force Museum outside Moscow, its wings missing, a dilapidated relic of times past.

It is the perfect symbol for ""Restricted Areas,"" a photo series produced over the course of three winters by Russian photographer Danila Tkachenko, which immortalizes Soviet artifacts in high snow.

Many of the areas where the photos were taken were inaccessible during the Soviet era, as they contained classified technology. They depict monuments, factories, military bases and various kinds of vehicles and technology, most in an advanced state of decay.

Tkachenko says the project is about humanity's utopian drive for technological progress. But this drive came at a high price, he thinks, because governments were ready to sacrifice almost everything for it.

""I travel in search of places which used to have great importance for the technical progress, and which are now deserted,"" he writes on his website

""Those places lost their significance together with the utopian ideology which is now obsolete. Secret cities that cannot be found on maps, forgotten scientific triumphs, abandoned buildings of almost inhuman complexity.

In 1937, a young trucker named Malcolm McLean was delivering a load of cotton to a harbor in Hoboken, New Jersey. As he watched workers slowly transport the boxes by hand onto a ship, the story goes, he thought there had to be a better way to do it.

It turns out, there was: a big metal box that could be detached from the truck transporting it, and put on a ship. And about 20 years after first envisaging it, McLean was ready to show his invention to the world. He loaded a former war tanker with 58 ""trailer vans,"" as The New York Times called them in 1956, and set off to change history.

Little did McLean know that the intermodal container, as it would later be called, would not only revolutionize trade by decimating the cost of shipping, but it would also find a second life through architecture.

Becoming a thing

Affordable, sturdy and obviously, easy to transport, containers found an alternative use outside of shipping ports in the 1960s as portable showcases for trade fairs. But the first indication that someone wanted to make a ""habitable building"" out of one came from a 1987 patent application . Seven years later, futurist guru Stuart Brand of the counterculture magazine Whole Earth Catalog added to their profile with his book ""How Buildings Learn,"" which he wrote in a converted container.

But the father of modern container architecture, or ""cargotecture,"" is American architect Adam Kalkin , whose work in the field spans luxury homes in the US to orphanages in South Africa.

""Containers are mostly being used in architecture as low cost widgets in an iterative process,"" Kalkin said in an email. ""That is OK, necessary and important. But the results are predictably pedestrian. We do projects that are fun for us.""

This sense of fun is evident in his Push Button House, a fully furnished room in a container that pops open using hydraulics -- which debuted at the 2007 Venice Biennale.

Kalkin's 2003 project, 12 Container House, is still often cited as one of the most elegant and functional examples of container architecture. Since then, he says, things have changed.

""It has become a thing, so now you don't have to overcome as much disbelief when you work with people,"" he said. ""Every project is another opportunity to define the future of containerized architecture. Right now we are splicing hard core environmentalism with super nerdy technology.""

Affordable chic

The make-it-up-as-you-go nature of container architecture has made heroes of those who got it right early on. Among them is Peter DeMaria and his 2006 Redondo Beach House, the first two-story container structure to comply with the National Building Code in earthquake-prone Southern California.

The home was designed to combine heavy gauge steel and high-quality materials, while still being affordable. ""We consistently posed the question, 'what can a home be?' as opposed of being mired in 'what has a home been?'"" DeMaria said in an email interview.

""It spearheaded a whole movement in the architecture world and we're witnessing the impact today with the multitude of projects utilizing up-cycled shipping containers.""

Containers, he said, are cheap, ubiquitous and resistant to many of the threats buildings usually face, such as fire, mold, termites. Most importantly, they're already fabricated.

""All too often creatives look to reinvent the wheel but we're already surrounded by innovative solutions in non-architecture related industries,"" DeMaria said.

The wow factor

Container homes are varied in style and cost. Some are affordable, configurable and eco-conscious, such as the prefab ones made by Wisconsin-based Mods International . The company sells a fully ready, no-frills, 160-foot container home on Amazon for $23,000.

Others go straight for the wow factor, such as the Joshua Tree Residence, a 2,100-square-foot house made from white containers bursting out from a central point, to be built in 2018 just outside California's Joshua Tree National Park.

James Whitaker, the London architect who designed it, thinks containers offer an enjoyable challenge. ""You're given a very standard, strict module to work with, and you have to make it interesting. They're essentially the width of a bed, so it's challenging to see what interesting spaces you can create when you give yourself such a limitation,"" he said in a phone interview.

Pushing the envelope

Containers remain a popular choice for emergency or temporary accommodation and student housing (a recent notable example is Bjarke Ingels' Urban Rigger in Copenhagen), as well as retail units, schools, greenhouses, and even swimming pools.

But how about a whole stadium? Madrid's Fenwick Iribarren Architects plans to build one of the 2022 FIFA World Cup venues in Qatar from around 1,000 containers.

Not only would this cost half as much as a regular stadium, they claim, but once the tournament is over, the whole structure could be dismantled and shipped elsewhere. ""It's the perfect legacy solution,"" said designer Mark Fenwick in a phone interview.

""Instead of leaving behind a dilapidated area, after the event 20 or 30 different smaller sports venues can be built elsewhere from this structure, and the original site can become a public park or space for real estate development.""

More outlandish proposals -- which include one from 2015 involving a skyscraper -- aren't free from criticism. ""There's a school of purists that uses containers as a low-cost build module and other guys who use it mainly as an architectural deign element, because they like the industrial look of it,"" said Roger Wade, the entrepreneur who built Boxpark, a 60-container retail park in London which he describes as the world's first pop-up mall.

After using containers as a cheap alternative to bespoke stands in trade shows, Wade thought of using them for a retail store that could move to different locations, an idea inspired by the work of Adam Kalkin. Boxpark opened in London's Shoreditch district in 2011. ""In those days I had issues finding an architect that knew anything about container architecture, it was too early. People look at it now and think it's obvious, but it wasn't at the time,"" he said.

But now, Wade argues, the popularity of containers is making some designers misunderstand their nature. ""I use traditional containers and understand their limitations. Some designs out there have cantilevers and containers hanging off each other -- these are not even containers, they're made to look like them but they are bespoke structures that cost a fortune to make. That's no longer about a low-cost form of building,"" he said.

According to DeMaria, the evolution of container design has been like every other movement in architecture. ""There are incredible projects and then there are ill-advised projects,"" he said.

""A handful of architects have pushed the envelope with containers and the more these projects are built, the more creative the next generation of container based design will be."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180130124013-whitaker-studio-joshua-tree-residence-12-super-tease.jpg

For centuries, fireworks have been used to mark major events around the world: the births of nations, weddings, birthdays, funerals and New Year's celebrations.

In China, the tradition of lighting fireworks to ward off evil spirits has been passed down through the generations. In the US, meanwhile, fireworks are synonymous with the country's 4th of July celebrations . Elsewhere, Hindus use them to celebrate Diwali, while in Russia and across Europe, large displays have traditionally marked the end of wars.

But before fireworks can take over the skies, each one must be carefully and meticulously crafted. The process -- which can take days to complete -- is an art in its own right, according to Wu Hongyong, director of production and technology at one of China's biggest firework companies.

His firm, Jiangxi Zhongsen Fireworks Ltd, ships over 30,000 boxes of pyrotechnics around the world each year, with each of the fireworks made by hand.

""We see it as an art to make everyone in the world happy,"" Wu said.

Made in China

Having first invented gunpowder over 2,000 years ago, China now produces more fireworks than anywhere else in the world. The country is responsible for over 90% of America's Independence Day fireworks, exporting $307.8 million worth to the US for its July 4th celebrations in 2016 (the US produced just $10 million worth for the holiday that year).

""It is a complicated and messy process,"" Wu said. ""From purchasing materials to the production... it is time consuming.""

Each firework contains small balls of explosives, known as stars, that are responsible for the colorful light displays seen in the sky. They are mixed with gunpowder in a shell, and then wrapped in paper and fitted with a fuse. Stars can be wrapped and pressed into different designs, meaning that buyers can request particular shapes to commemorate important occasions.

Wilson Mao, the CEO of Hong Kong-based Pyromagic , requested a firework shaped like an ""8"" to mark the Lunar New Year. For decades, Pyromagic Multi-media Productions has been responsible for Hong Kong's firework displays. ""If you're superstitious, in Chinese culture 8 is a very auspicious number. In Chinese, it sounds similar to another word that means good fortune.""

A dark side to fireworks?

Factories filled with explosives also pose a risk to those who produce fireworks. In 2014, a deadly firework factory accident in China's Hunan province resulted in the death of 12 workers. In 2016, a similar incident in neighboring Jiangxi province resulted in three deaths and a mass evacuation of surrounding areas.

Safety checks at companies like Jiangxi Zhongsen Fireworks Ltd, which employs over 300 people, are often extensive. According to Wu, each load is inspected by six internal departments before being sent to government agencies for further checks.

For the factory workers, this is normally the last they'll see of the devices they produce. Nonetheless, watching fireworks ignite in the sky can leave a lasting impression on their creators.

""While we make the fireworks, we don't participate in setting them off,"" said Liu Zhilian, a 40-year-old worker at the factory. ""But it's a beautiful sort of feeling. It's glorious when a firework explodes."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180704105352-hk-fireworks-tease-1-super-tease.jpg
6b8905a2dd2a4a73a565ae45709ccf06	[]	2018-08-30 12:19:44+00:00	The mud volcano capital of the world	https://www.cnn.com/	US	The mud volcano capital of the world	1	"(CNN) — Stretching to the horizon, the gray-white earth rises in peaks like a well-whipped meringue petrified into mud and rock.

A keen wind whips these otherworldly hills, while the land underfoot is cracked and scaly.

This could be Mars. But it's Azerbaijan , the mud volcano capital of the world.

Oil-rich region

There are more than 400 volcanoes in this oil-rich country balanced between Europe and Asia, with more being discovered all the time.

Ten years ago, a 12,000-hectare State Nature Reserve was founded on the Absheron Peninsula near the capital Baku.

In July 2018, scientists from Azerbaijan's Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources took CNN Travel on an off-road tour.

Clattering up the precipitous slopes in an off-road vehicle is like a firmer version of the dune-bashing safaris popular next door in the Middle East. But the most thrilling sights are still to come.

We start our tour beside the mouth of Deveboynu volcano, or ""Neck of the Camel."" The land around is parched, but inside the crater, a muddy slurry -- called mud breccia -- is bubbling gently.

The hills may look peaceful, but below this humped, reptilian landscape, the Earth is breathing and turning like a slumbering beast.

Where tectonic plates collide

Mud volcanoes are usually found in subduction zones -- the parts of the globe where tectonic plates collide, sometimes causing earthquakes, tsunamis and violent eruptions.

Pockets of subterranean gas force their way to the surface, belching out methane and a muddy mix of water and oil.

Mud volcanoes never grow to the size of regular volcanoes. Most are small, ever-changing landforms, often accompanied by peculiar sculptures formed by the spewed out clumps of clay.

These whimsical shapes, says Jeyhun Pashayev, director of the reserve, are ""like a picture made by a child.""

Strange beauty

""When there are mud volcanoes, it means there are carbohydrogen resources in the deep,"" explains Pashayev. ""As you see, there are lot of mud volcanoes in Azerbaijan which means there are a lot of oil resources.""

The arid lands of the Absheron Peninsula might not be as fresh and lush as the mountainous north, but they have their own strange beauty.

This is the region richest in natural resources: both for oil and for the mud breccia, which is used in the chemical and construction industries.

""About 20 of the 50 minerals used in cement"" are to be found in the volcanic mud, says Pashayev -- which meant that before the reserve was signed into existence, people regularly stole mud from the site for home building projects.

As we set out on the road again to our next volcanic field, Pashayev gestures towards a huge factory on the horizon, with a large hill of mud to its side. ""This, Garadagh, is the richest part of Baku. Around 90% of the stones are being produced here for building the houses. Depending on the quality, it costs from 50 cents to 3 manats ($1.77) per stone.""

Mud-bathing

Unlike regular volcanoes, there's no magma or lava, so the liquid mud isn't hot -- instead it usually keeps to a temperate 22/23 C (72 F).

That balminess means that some mud volcanoes are suitable for bathing.

Volcanic clay is sometimes used in the treatment of skin conditions, as well as rheumatism and diseases related to the nervous system.

Pashayev explains that during the Soviet era, the volcanic mud was sometimes used to create casts to treat broken bones.

""Also, you can get super results using the mud volcanoes for the skin,"" he claims. ""You can use [the mud] and get good results, even if you have scars. If the cosmetology doctor can't disappear the scars, mud volcanoes can do this!""

Radioactivity

However, not every gray puddle is skin-friendly.

""Because it comes from deep,"" says Pashayev, some volcanoes ""come with radioactive material. It's not a joke.""

Pashayev's team monitors the levels of radioactivity regularly, with safety certification being awarded on an annual basis.

The subterranean world has fascinated people around the globe for millennia, and the strange, violent and seemingly inexplicable behavior of mud volcanoes has long captivated the Azerbaijani people.

The country is known as the Land of Fire -- while Baku is the City of Winds -- and some of the gas leaks in this oil-rich region are constantly on fire, such as at the perpetually burning mountainside of Yanar Dag.

It's believed that the ancient Zoroastrian religion, which centers on fire worship, was closely connected to this phenomena.

In 2001, Lokbutan volcano some 15 kilometers from Baku erupted, sending flames close to 50 feet in the air.

'A mystic thing'

The ever-bubbling cauldron of Pilpili Gardag. Maureen O'Hare/CNN

""Mud volcanoes are a mystic thing,"" says Pashayev. Some years ago, a Danish sound archivist came to the reserve ""with a huge device like a piano"" to record the sounds from within the volcano.

What Pashayev heard shocked him. ""I swear, I thought that this is Hell. I heard human noises -- really. Imagine thousands of people, crying 'help us!' from the deep.""

With a similarly evocative turn of phrase, Pashayev also compares the wind sighing through a mud sculpture to the sound made ""when you cut the head off a cow"" -- a common sight on the backstreets of Baku until butchery regulations were changed earlier this year.

And if the Azerbaijani landscape seems otherworldly, that could be because conditions here aren't dissimilar to Mars.

A number of possible mud volcanoes have been found on Mars , suggesting the presence -- at one time -- of water, and therefore the possibility of life.

'Millions of snakes'

""There are six types of mud volcano,"" explains Pashayev. ""Active. Not active. Oil-producing. Underwater. Island mud volcano. And destroyed mud volcano.""

There are around 140 underwater mud volcanoes in Azerbaijan and there are six island volcanoes under the reserve's jurisdiction -- although explains scientist Anar Baghiriv, the team lacks the resources to visit them.

But on one of the island volcanoes, Pashayev explains, the strangest sight isn't the bubbling mud. ""From 100 meters, you see that the island is shaking. But when you go close, you see millions of snakes, can you imagine? Millions.""

So covered is the island with sea snakes, adds Baghiriv, ""You cannot find a place to put your foot.""

What lies beneath

Pilpili Gardag is the last stop on our tour. Once we're ushered past the security guard, it's a steep walk uphill to the most dramatic volcano yet.

The slick surface of the mud glistens in the searing July sunshine, with huge gray bubbles forming and then bursting with a satisfying plup.

Mud volcano eruptions vary enormously, from those that quietly, continuously pour out slow streams of slurry, to explosive eruptions that expel thousands of cubic meters at once.

In Azerbaijan, says Pashayev, we have ""different sizes, different views, different sculptures. We have all the types, all the forms.""

The Guinness Book of Records lists the world's largest mud volcano as being an Azerbaijani one, measuring one kilometer across the base and several hundred kilometers in height.

At Pilipili Gardag, the volatile lunar landscape, with the sun bouncing white off the bleached-out clay and the summer heat sliding towards 40 C (104 F), has an uncanny majesty.

At the crossroads of Europe and Asia, bordered by the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus Mountains, it was an important thoroughfare on the Silk Road, the ancient web of trade routes linking East and West.

By the 19th century, Sheki, on the Silk Road path through northwest Azerbaijan, was an international center for silk production.

Today, it's one of Azerbaijan's most picturesque towns, filled with cobbled streets and medieval architecture: a fresh, bucolic retreat from the more arid south.

Caravanserai roadside inns

High in the Caucasus Mountains, shielded from the world by forest-covered mountains, passing traders and their goods-laden animals would stop here on their way to Tbilisi or Baku and overnight at one of the town's five caravanserai.

These roadside inns were once dotted all along the Silk Roads, and today's travelers to Azerbaijan -- there were a record 2.7 million international tourists in 2017 -- can rest their head in an authentic 18th-century caravanserai, the Yukhari Karavansaray Hotel.

Sheki is a mountainous retreat in northern Azerbaijan. Maureen O'Hare/CNN

A mini fortress halfway up M.F. Axundov Street in Sheki's Old Town, entry to the hotel is through an imposing original wood doorway.

Inside is a twin-level arcade of arches around a peaceful central courtyard in which traders' camels were once tied, but which is now dotted with trees and seating spots.

l e v a r t

The guest rooms are on the first floor and while undeniably spartan -- the furnishings and media facilities may well date back to the country's Soviet area -- with prices starting at just 30 Manats (about $18) a night, it's a small price to pay for an authentic historical experience.

The rooms' arched brickwork ceilings and small windows mean there's no need for air conditioning in summer, though winters can reportedly get a little cold.

There are more luxurious accommodation options in town for those who choose to stay elsewhere but still pay a visit to the caravanserai.

Day trippers can explore the courtyard between noon and 7 p.m., but overnight guests have the place to themselves come morning and evening.

There's a large garden restaurant out back as well as an atmospheric stone-walled tea house.

The Palace of Sheki Khans

l e v a r t

A few steps up the hill is Sheki's top tourist attraction, the summer palace of the Sheki Khans, who ruled this corner of the Caucasus between 1743 and 1819.

Built in the late 18th century, this two-story building has a breathtakingly ornate interior and exterior.

Russian wood, French strained glass, Ottoman ceramics and Iranian mirrorwork all went into the construction of this pleasingly picture-perfect and symmetrical masterpiece.

The facade is covered in large part by a mosaic of multicolored glass set in a wooden lattice, called a shebeke, constructed without nails or glue. Examples of shebeke artistry can be found throughout Sheki.

Inside, its six rooms are entirely covered with elaborate frescoes depicting flowers, fauna, battles and hunting scenes.

The Russian invasion of the early 19th century may have put an end to the khanate but the painstakingly crafted palace and the peaceful gardens beyond have survived intact to delight visitors for generations since.

English-speaking tours can be arranged in advance.

As befits the cosmopolitan nature of this trading town, Sheki has a long history of religious diversity, with many churches and mosques in the region.

A few kilometers north of town, the Church of Kish -- completed in the first century CE and used most recently as a Caucasian Albanian church -- is one of the country's oldest.

There are souvenir shops lining Sheki's main streets selling ceramics, samovars and scarves made of the town's signature product: silk.

Locals head to Aliahmed Sweets to buy their halva and other treats. Maureen O'Hare/CNN

Piti, a chunky meat stew eaten with bread, is the local specialty, while halva -- the sticky treat made from sugar and nuts -- is perfected at Aliahmed Sweets.

Out of town, the roads that once served as Silk Road routes are still busy with traders.

While Soviet-born Zhiguli cars buzz by alongside more modern vehicles, roadside vendors sell tandir bread, where the dough is slapped straight onto the side of a clay oven, and qutab -- light-as-air dough griddled with greens and seasoned with sumac.

Hungry travelers stop at the roadside to eat and drink freshly made tea at makeshift tables under shade-giving trees.

With Azerbaijan introducing new easy three-day visas in 2017, this path through the Caucasus is as lively as ever.

More than 170 years later, Azeri Light crude oil is still the country's most valuable resource.

But in the little town of Naftalan, 320 kilometers west of Baku in the foothills of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, an unusual local oil -- also called Naftalan -- has been attracting the travel set for hundreds of years.

This crude oil is too thick for commercial use and it isn't much good for burning. But it's said to have health-giving properties and so people have been bathing in it since ancient times.

Recently, treatments involving being submerged in the dark gloop have had a resurgence.

'Thick blood of the Earth'

The nine-hotel Naftalan resort was founded in 1926, at the dawn of Azerbaijan's Soviet era when physical fitness was a popular passion.

These days, spring and fall are the peak seasons, when the hotels are fully booked with guests arriving from all over the world.

It's easy to see why -- roses are in bloom throughout the health resort, while butterflies fly through the open windows along with fresh mountain air.

Around 15,000 people a year come here to sit in baths of warm oil, soaking up what locals call ""the thick blood of the Earth.""

Naftalan oil is reputed to ease more than 70 skin, joint and bone diseases. It's used as a disinfectant, an anti-inflammatory and even as an anesthetic.

""It is proven to be an effective treatment of the diseases of musculoskeletal system, skin diseases, gynecological and urological diseases and especially good results reached in treatment of rheumatism,"" Azer Vagifov, the main medical practitioner of Qarabagh Spa-Hotel, tells CNN Travel

Local legend

Naftalan oil is unique to the region. Naftalan Booking

Locals have long known of the therapeutic benefits of Naftalan oil.

The earliest record is in the 12th century, when Azerbaijani poet Nizami Ganjavi wrote of it being exported to neighboring countries through traders' caravans.

Legend has it that its healing properties were first discovered when a caravan camel fell sick and was left behind.

The camel rolled into an oil pool and when the caravan returned weeks later the creature was discovered by its herder, fully recovered.

In the 13th century, Italian explorer Marco Polo wrote in ""The Travels"" of the oil used for ""anointing the camels in maladies of the skin, and for other purposes; for which reason people come from a great distance for it.""

The science bit

So what makes this oil so special?

Its effectiveness is mostly credited to its unusually high concentration of naphthalene (around 50%), a hydrocarbon that's an active ingredient in coal tar soaps -- often used to treat skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema -- but also commonly used as a moth repellant.

At Naftalan Resort, treatments are preceded by a full medical checkup. The procedure isn't advisable for those with heart conditions or diseases of the nervous system, or undergoing cancer treatment.

After the initial blood test, ultrasound and inhalation tests are carried out. If no restrictions are detected, the patient is then directed to their first oil bath.

The oil treatment can be taken externally and internally, depending on the patient's condition and doctor's prescriptions.

The average age of patients is around 40 years old, but children as young as six are permitted to take the treatment.

While no link has been found between oil bath treatments and cancer, EU and US regulations have both deemed naphthalene a potential carcinogen for humans, as does the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO).

Naftalan Resort says that the treatment is harmless and has been scientifically proven, citing that there are around 1,500 scientific research projects and 270 dissertations on the subject.

Hot and fragrant

If you've ever wondered what it's like to sit in a bathtub full of crude oil, the sensation's probably not too dissimilar to being in hot chocolate, given that the oil in the tub is a piping 39 C (102 F).

Warmed-up crude is undeniably fragrant, but while some complain about the smell, it's really not that overpowering.

One guest who traveled here from St Petersburg with her son told CNN Travel that she was willing to endure the sulfuric odor because ""you come here with psoriasis but leave with beauty.""

Each bath lasts 10 minutes, with courses of treatments running anywhere from three days to three weeks.

You may take your bath half full, or it could be filled up to your neck -- it all depends on the prescription of your physician.

If a full body bath isn't recommended, there's equipment for applying the treatment locally on arms and legs.

Trying to do anything yourself is strictly prohibited and is frankly impossible, due to the fact that moving around in a huge puddle of oil is naturally very slippy.

Guests relax after their treatment. Naftalan Booking

After the procedure is complete, an assistant will use a scraping brush to help remove the coating of oil and they'll then lead you to the shower area. The oil takes a fair amount of washing and scrubbing to remove, and the fragrance persists.

Whether it's a reaction to the 39 C heat or the oil itself, the immediate sensation after the procedure is fatigue and and patients are advised to rest for at least 40 minutes.

Complex treatment

There's a lot more to the Naftalan Resort than oil baths.

Depending on the treatment plan, guests might supplement their visit with physiotherapy, hydro-massages, paraffin treatments and aromatherapy hydrobaths.

Then there's the cedar barrel sauna, said to intensify the already metabolism-boosting properties of an oil bath treatment.

There's also an on-site gym, yoga and Pilates studios, an outdoor pool, outdoor massage areas a vitamin bar and a tearoom.

The long-term result of the procedures is said to be visible within a month, but some patients report seeing results after just taking three baths.

One guest who had been suffering from back pain and joint pain in his legs said he was so motivated by his improved health conditions, he walked about a kilometer to the Naftalan river to fish with his friends.

A woman, Alena, said it was her fourth visit in two years and that the baths gave her a chance to live life fully, without pain.

And if you've been wondering what happens to the oil after someone's bathed in it -- it's recycled. It all goes back to a communal tank for future bathers.

""Black gold"" is a precious commodity, after all.

The decision, which was expected, is a sign of increased confidence in the US economy. Unemployment is low, economic growth is strong, and inflation is relatively stable.

Policymakers under Chairman Jerome Powell unanimously agreed to raise the federal funds rate a quarter percentage point, to a range of 2% to 2.25%. The rate helps determine rates for mortgages, credit cards and other consumer borrowing.

""Our economy is strong,"" Powell said at a press conference on Wednesday. ""These rates remain low, and my colleagues and I believe that this gradual returning to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy.""

Central bankers raised expectations for a fourth rate hike in December, with a majority now in favor of such a move. In June, policymakers were split on whether the Fed should raise rates four times this year or three.

Looking ahead to 2019, Fed officials expect at least three rate hikes will be necessary, and one more in 2020.

""The Fed shows no signs of taking (a) breath in rate hikes,"" Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in a research note.

The central bank also stripped the word ""accommodative"" from its description of monetary policy. That may be a signal that the Fed believes interest rates are finally at a neutral level, meaning they neither stimulate nor hinder the economy.

The Fed kept rates near record lows for years to encourage growth after the financial crisis. But it has been gradually raising them over the past three years.

Daragh Maher, the head of FX strategy for the United States at HSBC, said the change in language reflects ""the reality that policy can no longer be usefully described as loose.""

The Fed wants to raise interest rates steadily to keep the economy from overheating, but avoid raising rates so quickly that it brings on could help start a recession.

For now, the chairman has maintained that gradual interest-rate increases are the best way to balance those risks.

Powell said that central bankers have heard a ""rising chorus"" of concerns from businesses about the US-China trade war. But he said that the economic impact of US tariffs is ""still relatively small.""

He warned that tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices, but said policymakers don't see that in the numbers just yet.

Walmart, Gap, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Macy's and other companies have said tariffs could force them to raise prices on everyday consumer goods.

The Fed raised its expectation for economic growth this year to 3.1% from 2.8%, reflecting strength in the second and current quarters.

But for 2019, Fed officials expect growth to slow to 2.5% amid worries about the growing trade rift between the United States and China. The revised estimate is slightly higher than what policy makers expected last quarter, at 2.4%.

The FOMC also gave its first look of what it expects for the economy in 2021. Policy makers anticipate economic growth will shrink to 1.8% in that year.

Investors and former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke have warned of an economic slowdown in 2020."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180824110737-fed-chairman-jerome-powell-071718-780x439.jpg

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised rates for the third time this year, reflecting a strong economy with low unemployment. Hours later, the president again broke with tradition by criticizing the central bank.

""I am not happy about that,"" he said at a press conference in New York. ""I'd rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs, so I'm worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates. We can do other things with the money.""

He added: ""But they raised them, and they're raising them because we're doing so well."" He also said he was happy for people who save their money and ""are starting to get interest.""

The Fed has been gradually raising rates for three years, finally restoring them to normal levels long after the financial crisis. The central bank manages rates to stimulate a weak economy or to keep it from running too hot, which can set off inflation.

The Fed is designed to be independent of political interference, and presidents generally avoid commenting on monetary policy. But Trump told CNBC in July and Reuters in August that higher rates undermine America's competitive edge against other countries.

""I'm not thrilled with his raising of interest rates, no. I'm not thrilled,"" Trump, who himself appointed Powell to lead the central bank, said in the Reuters interview. ""I should be given some help by the Fed.""

At his own press conference earlier in the day, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was asked about Trump's criticism and brushed it off.

""We don't consider political factors or things like that,"" Powell said. ""That's who we are. That's what we do. And that's just the way it's always going to be for us.""

Since Trump took office, the Fed has raised rates six times, including three times under Powell. The Fed is gradually raising rates as the economy gains strength.

At the press conference, Powell said that the Fed considers the best thinking and evidence in determining interest-rate policy.

""We've been given a really important job to do on behalf of the American people by Congress, and we've been given the tools to do it,"" he said. ""My colleagues and I are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission."""	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180926132621-01-powell-trump-split-092418-restricted-780x439.jpg
c4f3e6ebc2c84d57a4eb7cacb7ea8558	['Paul R. La Monica']	2018-09-25 00:00:00	Why investors aren't freaking out about inflation	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Why investors aren't freaking out about inflation	1	"Bond yields in the United States have been rising.

But investors aren't freaking out. The Dow and S&P 500 both hit all-time highs last week -- and the Nasdaq is not far from a record, either.

The 10-Year Treasury yield is still relatively low, but it has topped the psychologically important 3% threshold and is currently hovering around 3.1%.

The concern is that this may be just the beginning. Longer-term rates could keep climbing given that the Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term rates Wednesday.

At some point, investors may start to grow wary of what rising rates will mean for consumer spending and businesses looking to borrow more money. Higher rates, in theory, should lead to slower growth for both the economy and corporate earnings.

The question is: how many more rate hikes are coming? Fed chair Jerome Powell may provide some clues at a press conference after the Fed decision is announced.

Craig Birk, chief investment officer of Personal Capital, said that the market should be able to handle a few more quarter-point rate increases. But many investors may have gotten spoiled since rates were unusually low for so long.

The federal funds rate is now in a range of 1.75% to 2% and there are expectations it could climb above 3% over the next year. Birk said many investors are hoping the Fed will end its rate hiking campaign in 2019 though.

""We finally have a real interest rate, not one that's just zero,"" Birk said. ""The Fed is still saying that they will likely raise rates slowly and steadily but the market seems to be betting they will stop sooner.""

Birk added the Fed had been run by so-called doves, people like former Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen who preferred to keep rates low, for years. Investors are trying to adjust to the new mindset at the Fed.

""The market is still getting used to the idea that the Fed will be more balanced and more hawkish,"" Birk said.

In other words, investors may be underestimating the willingness of the Fed to keep raising rates -- despite criticism from President Donald Trump about rate hikes and even if the data doesn't conclusively show inflation picking up in a meaningful way.

Still, some experts think the Fed is likely to stick to its path of gradual rate increases. Powell, like his predecessors, is probably not interested in rattling the bond and stock markets with surprise moves.

""We do not see rising interest rates as a reason to sell stocks, particularly in the absence of runaway inflation,"" wrote John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial, in a report Tuesday.

Inflation is still under control for now

Wage growth is picking up, but that hasn't led to a big spike in consumer prices. So the Fed may still have some wiggle room to keep raising rates since the economy appears to be on solid footing.

""The market is interpreting higher rates as a response to better growth, not as a reason to fear a policy mistake, which we find encouraging,"" Lynch added.

Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA, isn't overly worried about inflation getting out of control either.

""It's premature to say the Fed is behind the curve,"" said Keon. ""The question is what happens next year and 2020. There are some reasons to believe price pressures may continue to build. I don't think rates will get too high.""

Keon thinks the 10-Year Treasury yield could climb to a range of about 3.25% to 3.5%. That's still low enough to keep the economy humming along at a relatively solid clip, even if growth slows a bit.

So the biggest change that might come from the Fed's rate hikes is a shift in the types of stocks that investors favor most. Tech stocks, retailers and other consumer companies, big winners of the past year, may start to lose some ground to financials.

Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist with INTL FCStone, is bullish on regional bank stocks (KRE) and Bank of America (BAC), which has a big mortgage business. They should benefit from higher rates since it will make their lending operations more profitable."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180731103144-markets-volatile-federal-reserve-780x439.jpg
d0335a058ae8405e902e688d7d507ce0	['Jill Disis']	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Google grilled over 'Project Dragonfly' at Senate hearing on data privacy	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Google grilled over 'Project Dragonfly' at Senate hearing on data privacy	1	"Google has finally admitted that a ""Project Dragonfly"" is indeed in the works.

But that's about all a Google executive was willing to divulge Wednesday about the codenamed plan, which has been widely reported to be a search product the company is developing for China — one that would need to comply with government censorship.

The rumored existence of the Chinese search engine came up repeatedly during a Senate committee hearing in Washington, where several major technology and telecommunications executives were testifying about a potential federal law to regulate data privacy.

The prospect of a Google-sanctioned search engine for China has become a hot-button issue. Reports began surfacing last month that Google was working on a product that would block sensitive websites and search terms in accordance with Chinese censorship.

The New York Times later reported that more than a thousand Google employees have questioned the plan. That criticism is ongoing — The Times reported early Wednesday that a former Google research scientist blasted the Chinese search product in a letter to lawmakers this week.

However, Google had refused to comment until Wednseday, when Google (GOOG) chief privacy officer Keith Enright joined executives from AT&T (T), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Twitter (TWTR) and Charter Communications (CHTR) at the Senate hearing (AT&T owns CNN.). The point of the hearing was for the executives to outline what they want out of any new US regulatory proposal — they largely opposed any law as restrictive as the recent data privacy reforms adopted or passed by the European Union and California.

But lawmakers fixated on Enright. They lobbed questions at him about all kinds of controversies facing Google and the rest of the tech industry, privacy-related or otherwise.

Enright did not link ""Dragonfly"" to the reports about developing a Chinese search engine. He name-dropped it only when pressed about the existence of a ""Project Dragonfly"" by Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican.

""I am not clear on the contours of what is in scope or out of scope for that project,"" Enright added.

When Cruz prodded Enright for more information, the privacy officer would only reiterate what CEO Sundar Pichai has already said about the rumored product.

""I need to be clear for the record that my understanding is that we are not close to launching a search product in China,"" Enright said. ""And whether we eventually could or would remains unclear.""

Though Google received a lot of the attention at Wednesday's hearing, the other companies did not entirely escape scrutiny. Lawmakers peppered the executives with questions about how they use consumer data, and how they define what is private and what is not.

The concept of a federal law that governs data privacy has become increasingly important to lawmakers, especially in recent months.

The European Union made waves earlier this year when its General Data Protection Regulation went into effect. Those rules forced companies that operate in that region to revise their data privacy policies.

Then in June, California passed the toughest data privacy law in the US. When that law goes into effect in 2020, it will grant consumers the right to know what companies like Facebook and Google are collecting from them, why those companies are collecting it and who they are sharing it with. Consumers will also be able to bar tech companies from selling their data.

AT&T's Len Cali, the senior vice president of global public policy, cited a ""host of burdens"" associated with the GDPR during his testimony Wednesday.

""Perhaps if it existed at the the companies at this table started, we wouldn't be here, none of them would be here,"" he said.

Other executives argued along similar lines, adding that whatever law is passed should not be so cumbersome as to hurt innovation, especially at small and medium-sized companies. Many also wanted a law that pre-empts state statutes, like the one California just passed.

Consumer advocacy groups have opposed the industry's objections to GDPR and the California law. In a letter to the Senate committee that conducted the hearing, the American Civil Liberties Union called for legislation that would install safeguards for consumers.

""In the last year, we have seen countless data breaches, sharing of sensitive data without consent, and reports that companies have misled consumers regarding their data practices,"" the ACLU wrote. ""It is past time for Congress to right the imbalance in our laws that has failed to protect consumers from industry practices that strip them over control of their data in the interest of profit.""

Senator John Thune, the chairman of the commerce, science and transportation committee and a South Dakota Republican, said Wednesday that lawmakers intend to hold a second hearing next month. He added that a California privacy activist and the head of GDPR enforcement have already agreed to testify."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/130612105019-employer-china-google-1-780x439.jpg

cdc7d998190e4bd080cadfd4911b9711	['Samantha Murphy Kelly']	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Apple Watch Series 4 review: It's time to give one to Grandma	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Apple Watch Series 4 review: It's time to give one to Grandma	1	"The new Apple Watch is showing up the latest iPhones.

September is typically the time for Apple fans to ooh and ahh over the latest smartphones -- and the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are indeed worthy upgrades. But the real showstopper this year is the smartwatch: It's faster, more functional and could literally save your life.

The Apple Watch Series 4, which hits stores on Friday, represents the watch's first major redesign since its 2015 debut. Tucked into a more attractive design -- including slightly rounded corners, a slimmer body and 30% more screen space to tap tiny icons and texts -- this new Apple Watch is also a health-tracking powerhouse.

The wearable comes with a handful of features aimed at a whole new demographic: the elderly. One new tool, for example, recognizes when a user falls and automatically sends a notification to their emergency contact. It's also the first wearable with a built-in ECG monitor available over the counter. The feature has been cleared by the FDA so it can be used as a medical device. The ECG's software will be activated in the United States later this year. Apple hasn't said whether it'll come to devices globally.

The watch starts at $399 for a 40mm model and $429 for the slightly larger 44mm version. That starting price bumps up to $499 for cellular connectivity. (The Series 3 started at $329).

While the Series 4 price tag is higher, experts say Apple's features could modernize hospital and geriatric care, and even assist field-service workers in dangerous environments. The company put the smartwatch through a series of intensive tests, including one designed to train it to distinguish between a delicate plop onto the bed and a hard fall on the floor.

""By making this feature available on the latest watch, Apple stands to displace existing fall-detection equipment in many verticals,"" said market analysis firm IDC's Jitesh Ubrani, acknowledging brands like Life Alert. ""I have no doubt the new Apple Watch will make patient monitoring much easier and far more regular.""

That's because people will be more likely to show off (and keep on) a cool-looking Apple Watch compared to a traditional medical device.

Weston Henderek, director of the NPD Group, says the ECG functionality could one day help diagnose conditions such as atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat. Users can create long-term running logs of ECGs that can be shared with their doctors over time.

The new features are notable, but Henderek cautions the role of the Apple Watch as a true medical device is still a work in progress.

""The space will not be truly revolutionized until additional medical tracking functionality, such as blood glucose and blood pressure monitoring, are added to devices like the Apple Watch,"" Weston said.

Meanwhile, Fitbit -- Apple's biggest wearables competitor -- is also thinking ahead. In August, Fitbit unveiled its Charge 3 tracker with a Sp02 sensor, shorthand for peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, that measures blood-oxygen levels. Coupled with Fitbit's heart-rate tracker and sleep monitoring, this trifecta provides a solid snapshot of overall health. Although the Fitbit lacks the Series 4's fall detection and ECG monitoring, it's also a fraction of the cost at $149.

Apple Watch continues to lag behind competitors in sleep tracking, a feature Apple omitted. The Series 4 can't afford to shave any hours off its battery life, which is about 18 hours on a charge. Meanwhile, Fitbit's Charge 3 lasts for days.

As wearables get smarter, companies face a major challenge to educate the public how to properly use their products as medical devices.

""Consumers don't really know the difference between FDA 'approval' and 'clearance,'"" Ubrani, the IDC analyst, pointed out. Plus, ""some of the features are designed for healthy consumers rather than those who already have medical issues. ... It's easy for consumers to conflate the issues and think the Apple Watch will replace a traditional doctor's visit.""

For now, experts believe users will prioritize staying connected via notifications such as texts, alerts and emails over health tracking. After all, users can now summon Siri with just a raise of the wrist, jump in and out of apps at faster speeds, and enjoy louder and more immersive sound, making it easier to take calls from the device.

The Series 4 also comes with new interactive watch faces. But a lack of downloadable custom options is a missed opportunity for developers, Apple and users.

Ultimately, however, Apple's greater push into health is its biggest growth opportunity. It will likely appeal to a new demographic, ignite partnerships with health and life insurance companies to offer the device to employees, and roll out internationally.

IDC predicts Apple Watch sales will soar more than 38% year-over-year and expects that rate to continue for the next 5 years, largely because of the device's focus on health.

""Apple is already the No. 1 player in the smartwatch market by a big margin and has shown very strong growth,"" NPD Group's Henderek said. ""But continuing that momentum and finding new ways to grow will become even more challenging.""

For now, the company hopes you'll splurge on an Apple Watch this holiday season not only for the kids and for yourself -- but for Grandma, too.

— Correction: An earlier version of this story inaccurately said that the ECG monitor feature has been given FDA approval. It has received FDA clearance, a less rigorous level of FDA evaluation."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180925190741-tim-cook-apple-watch-sep-12-780x439.jpg

The carmaker announced Wednesday that current research and development boss Ola Källenius will become chief executive in 2019, making him the first non-German to lead the owner of Mercedes Benz.

Källenius will take the reins at a tumultuous time for the auto industry.

Global automakers are pouring investment dollars into the development of electric and self-driving vehicles as they seek to head off upstarts such as Tesla (TSLA) and Waymo, a Google (GOOGL) spinoff that is working on autonomous cars.

Daimler (DMLRY) faces even more challenges.

Sales of diesel cars have dropped sharply in Europe because of emissions cheating scandals and plans in some countries to phase out the technology. EU regulators are also investigating whether Daimler and other German automakers held back the development of technology that could have reduced pollution.

Daimler profits slipped 19% in the first half of 2018 compared to the same period last year, results the company pinned on higher tariffs on US vehicles exported to China. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly threatened import tariffs on cars made in Europe.

The carmaker has also attracted the attention of Li Shufu, the billionaire chairman of Chinese car maker Geely, who has invested about $9 billion buying a stake of almost 10% in Daimler.

""It's a hugely complicated job,"" said Tim Urquhart, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit. ""There are major challenges facing the whole industry, huge pressures from the technology companies coming in, and also the ongoing move forward towards electrification and autonomy.""

Daimler announced a restructuring plan earlier this year called ""Project Future"" that is designed to make the company more flexible and improve its focus on connected vehicles and autonomous driving. It has also formed a partnership with Chinese tech company Baidu (BIDU).

Other German carmakers are also making the shift. Volkswagen for example has committed to spending more than €50 billion ($59 billion) on battery cells as it pushes to electrify all 300 models in its range by 2030.

The chosen one

Källenius, who joined Daimler in 1993 and has spent his entire career at the carmaker, has long been viewed as a potential successor to Zetsche.

""We are making the [management] younger and thus giving it new impetus,"" Michael Brecht, the deputy chairman of Daimler's board, said in a statement.

Urquhart said that Källenius had been ""bred"" for the job and that it was ""hard to think about anyone better suited.""

""He is closer to the age of the younger demographics that Daimler is increasingly targeting and he has been across the biggest technological advances in the industry in his previous role,"" he added.

Dr. Z moves on up

Zetsche's departure as CEO marks the end of an era at Daimler. The mustachioed executive, best known in the United States as the ""Dr. Z"" once featured in Chrysler commercials, has led the carmaker for 12 years.

""He had this big goal of overtaking BMW as the world's largest premium carmaker by sales by reestablishing the brand, and that's what he has done,"" Urquhart said.

Daimler said it would ask shareholders to make Zetsche chairman of the Supervisory Board starting in 2021, where he will continue to wield influence.

""In various positions at Daimler, Ola Källenius has earned not only my respect, but also the recognition of his colleagues in very diverse areas,"" Zetsche said in a statement.

a337f150f01242158d20979cb47d1295	['Hadas Gold']	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Comcast takes Sky: Fox and Disney agree to sell stake in European broadcaster	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Comcast takes Sky: Fox and Disney agree to sell stake in European broadcaster	1	"Comcast is getting all of Sky.

21st Century Fox (FOX) announced Wednesday that it would sell its 39% stake in Sky (SKYAY) to Comcast (CMCSA), which won majority control of the European broadcaster in a dramatic auction over the weekend. Disney, which had backed Fox in the auction, said it had consented to the sale.

""In light of the premium Comcast has agreed to pay for Sky, we and Disney (DIS) have decided to sell 21CF's existing 39% holding in Sky to Comcast,"" Fox said in a statement. ""We congratulate Comcast on their pending acquisition.""

Comcast outbid Fox and Disney on Saturday in a rare auction for most of Sky that was administered by the UK Takeover Panel.

The US media company's final bid was £17.28 ($22.65) per share, valuing Sky at £30.6 billion ($40.1 billion). That was over 25% more than its previous offer of £14.75 ($19.43) per share.

The sale marks the end of an era for Fox patriarch Rupert Murdoch, who had repeatedly sought to gain full control of Sky.

Fox's latest takeover attempt faced lengthy delays as UK regulators investigated whether Fox would be a ""fit and proper"" owner and whether full control of Sky would give Murdoch's family too much control over UK media.

The battle took on added significance earlier this year when Disney outbid Comcast for a big chunk of Fox's assets including its existing stake in Sky.

Attention then turned to the battle for the remaining 61% of Sky.

On one side of the fight was Fox and its backer Disney. On the other was Comcast, which swooped in with an offer for Sky in February.

Both Comcast and Fox wanted to add Sky to their portfolios to help them compete with the likes of Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN). Sky is a leader in pay TV in the United Kingdom and other markets including Germany and Italy. It also sells broadband and mobile phone services.

Disney said in a statement on Wednesday that it would use the proceeds from the sale of its Sky stake to help pay for the Fox purchase. The sale should raise roughly $15 billion.

""The sale of Fox's Sky holdings will substantially reduce the cost of our overall acquisition and allow us to aggressively invest in building and creating high-quality content for our direct-to-consumer platforms to meet the growing demands of viewers,"" Disney CEO Robert Iger said.

Disney said it plans to expand and invest in streaming services including Hulu, in which it will soon own a 60% stake. The other major investor in Hulu is Comcast, which owns 30%.

The sterner challenge facing big names such as Starbucks (SBUX) and Apple (AAPL) has nothing to do with the trade war. At least, not yet. It's about new competition and increased wealth.

""It doesn't work to just show up anymore,"" said Benjamin Cavender, a Shanghai-based analyst at consulting firm China Market Research Group, referring to brands that are household names in the West. ""Chinese consumer tastes are evolving rapidly.""

Coca-Cola (CCE) is one of the top companies that's having to adapt to this new reality.

""We've seen a tremendous change in the consumption patterns,"" Curtis Ferguson, the company's China CEO, told CNN at last week's World Economic Forum in the Chinese city of Tianjin.

Coke has launched more than 30 new drink brands in China in the past six months and now has about 275 in total, Ferguson said. They range from regular Coke to more exotic varieties with flavorings like yellow bean and apple fiber. Coke even has its own line of teas in China.

That's a big change from the Atlanta-based company's previous approach of relying on the strength of its brand.

The philosophy was ""let them drink Coke,"" Ferguson said. He argued Western companies can't afford to treat their brands as sacrosanct.

""Either you destroy your own brand in China, or someone else is going to do it for you,"" he said.

Starbucks scrambles to keep up

Starbucks learned the difficulties of shifting Chinese consumer habits the hard way.

The coffee chain has about 3,000 stores in the country, making it one of its top markets. But in June, the company reported a sudden slowdown in growth in China, just weeks after it had announced plans for rapid expansion there.

That's partly because it faces growing competition from an upstart local competitor. Luckin Coffee opened its first store in China less than a year ago. Now it has more than 500. Many of its customers order coffees online for delivery or takeout. Chinese consumers are also increasingly turning to delivery apps, like Meituan Dianping, for food or drinks.

""Starbucks has always been slow adopting technology in China,"" Cavender said. Its customers ""were tired of waiting in line to place orders.""

The global coffee giant is now trying to correct course. In August, it teamed up with Alibaba (BABA), China's largest e-commerce company, to launch delivery services.

Automakers face 'big challenge'

Global carmakers are also scrambling to keep pace with changes in China's auto market, the world's biggest. It's being shaken up by the rapid spread of electric vehicles, which have been promoted through government subsidies, resulting in a crowded market.

Francois Provost, Asia-Pacific chairman of Renault (RNLSY), said the French carmaker is now fighting competition from both traditional rivals and new upstarts in China. Local player Nio (NIO), for example, sells an SUV in China that costs about half the price of Tesla's (TSLA) Model X.

Sticker price is crucial in China, Provost said, as most customers are first-time buyers. But drivers are also demanding electric vehicles with longer battery life as networks of charging stations are still being built out across the country.

""The big challenge is increasing the efficiency of the range and reducing user costs at the same time,"" Provost said during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum. That will be tough for automakers, he predicts: ""I can't honestly say we have full visibility on this.""

Apple's losing the innovation race

Apple (AAPL) has lost market share in China to local rivals over the past two years. The iPhone accounts for less than 10% of smartphone sales in the country, analysts estimate. In the United States, it accounts for about 40%.

Apple is facing fierce competition from Chinese players such as Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi.

""In recent years, Apple has slid quite a lot in the Chinese market,"" said Canalys researcher Mo Jia. ""The very aggressive tech innovation from Chinese brands is changing the high-end landscape.""

The US company's latest models, the XS and XS Max, include features that could boost their appeal in the Chinese market, like dual SIM cards and a larger screen. But analysts are skeptical these will make much difference.

""Apple is fighting a bit of a losing battle,"" Cavender said.

Years of lies...

The Trump years have been defined by dishonesty. Fibs, falsehoods and outright lies. This was on display again at Wednesday's presser... As Jim Acosta said afterward, Trump was ""just not in touch with reality."" But now...

A moment of truth?

Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh will both testify on Thursday starting at 10 a.m. ET. The hearing is about both alleged misconduct and about lying. Is he lying about his high school and college innocence? Is she lying about his behavior? Will we ever know the truth of what happened in 1982? Maybe not, but Kavanaugh's statements from the past two weeks are also being tested. His recent assertions about his teenage years will be under severe scrutiny on Thursday...

>> Related: CNN.com has a list of 21 Q's he may be asked...

""Yet another case study...""

I asked Michiko Kakutani, author of ""The Death of Truth,"" for her impressions. What does this moment mean for the court and the country?

""Republican senators' eagerness to rush Kavanaugh's SCOTUS nomination through without a real investigation into the allegations of sexual assault against him is yet another case study in the toxic disregard for truth that has taken hold in Trump's Washington,"" she said.

And ""Kavanaugh's own statements -- about his school years, about his role in a controversial Bush-era judicial nomination, and his sycophantic remarks about President Trump -- suggest that he has a casual, if not troubled relationship with the truth. All this is a distressing mirror of the tribal politics and disdain for truth that has become a hallmark of the Trump era...""

Thursday's most likely outcome?

Will people end up even more polarized, even further apart on perceptions of the truth? That's my wager. Laura Ingraham was on Fox just now complaining about Ford not handing over her therapy session notes: ""There was no therapist! It's a big lie! Lie! Lie! Lie!"" It's just going to get more and more heated.

As Nate Silver tweeted: ""I keep thinking about those studies where, the more evidence you show a committed partisan against their case, the more it entrenches their original viewpoint...""

40 days til the midterms

CNN's Dana Bash, honored at the Moment Magazine luncheon at the Yale Club on Wednesday, talked with the mag's editor Nadine Epstein about the ""#MeToo missile that just landed at the U.S. Senate,"" among other topics...

""It's hard to imagine some of the female vote being more energized than it is right now pre-Kavanaugh,"" Bash said. ""But if it is possible, [Kavanaugh being confirmed] will energize them more. The flip side of that -- because there is a ying to every yang in politics -- if Kavanaugh goes down, the Republican base, which is not very energized right now, will then be energized. They understand they've been waiting a generation to replace Anthony Kennedy...""

Coverage plans

Every major player will be carrying the hearings live, including all the broadcast networks.

-- On CNN, Wolf Blitzer and Jake Tapper will anchor starting at 8:30... CNN's cable coverage will be live streamed on CNN.com, no login needed...

-- On Fox News, Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum will anchor starting at 9...

Trump 81-minute presser

Politico's Blake Hounshell summed it up in four words: ""Trump can't help himself.""

Everyone has an opinion about Wednesday's presser. My POV: More, please. The more Q's he takes, more often, from more outlets, the better informed we all are...

Two must-reads

Ashley Parker's WaPo recap: ""For a president facing one of the most consequential weeks of his presidency — and fighting for his Supreme Court nominee's political life — Trump at times seemed blissfully unaware of the stakes, deeply enjoying himself as he bantered with his press corps...""

Michael Grynbaum's NYT piece about the prez and the press: ""Trump made clear that he is never more comfortable, never more engaged, than when he is sparring with the news media that he loves to say he hates...""

Four sharp questions

ABC's Jon Karl: ""Can you understand why a victim of sexual assault would not report it at the time? Don't you understand?""

NBC's Hallie Jackson: ""Has there ever been an instance when you've given the benefit of the doubt to a woman?""

CNBC's Eamon Javers: ""You made a significant allegation against the Chinese government, you suggested that the Chinese had meddled in, or are meddling in the 2018 midterm election. What evidence do you have of that, sir?""

CBS's Steven Portnoy: ""What messages do you have for the young men of America?""

Six key quotes

-- Check with Sean: ""I was accused by -- I believe it was four women."" (False.) ""You can check with Sean Hannity, you can check with Fox because they covered it very strongly.""

-- Trump was crediting Hannity with covering the claims that ""women were paid to say bad things about me."" But in the next breath, he distanced himself from Hannity: ""Believe it or not, I don't speak to him very much, but I respect him.""

-- CNN's Jim Acosta was the fourth male reporter to be called on, so he asked Trump to take a Q from a female colleague next. Trump did, though The Daily Beast's Matt Wilstein observed that he repeatedly interrupted and talked over female reporters. CBS's Weijia Jiang persisted when Trump tried to cut her off, and asked how the accusations against him ""impact your opinions on the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh...""

-- Trump's love for the NYT shone through. He called it ""failing"" and said it was ""a paper I once loved,"" but then a few minutes later, he admitted, ""I still love the paper.""

-- When the NYT's Mark Landler told him ""We're kind of thriving, not failing these days,"" Trump said, ""You're doing very well. Say thank you, Mr. Trump."" Landler, politely: ""I think I'll stop short of that.""

-- When Hannah Thomas-Peter said she was from Sky News, Trump said, ""Congratulations on the purchase...""

Some flagrant falsehoods

Trump keeps saying that he won the women's vote in 2016. He's been saying this for more than six months. ""52% of women,"" he said again Wednesday. Well, he won 52% of white women voters, and 52% of men, but only 41% of all women voters. The first time he said this, it might've been a mistake. But now? After he's repeated it over and over?!

0b88864531504979a67c4e0ef17149e9	['Nathaniel Meyersohn']	2018-09-25 00:00:00	Nike shows that its business isn't just Colin Kaepernick	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Nike shows that its business isn't just Colin Kaepernick	1	"Nike wants investors to know that the strength of its business extends beyond Colin Kaepernick.

Nike delivered strong results in its most recent quarter, including double-digit growth in sneaker and clothing sales, digital sales and profit compared with the same time last year.

While shares of Nike have climbed about 36% this year, it seemed investors wanted even more from the company. Nike (NKE) stock was trading down about 4% after hours.

Tuesday's results were promising for a company that struggled last year as rival Adidas (ADDDF) gained popularity, and shoppers turned away from Nike's Jordan brand.

There was also good news in North America, the company's largest market. Sales rose 6% last quarter compared with a year earlier.

""In North America, we have returned to strong, sustainable growth,"" Nike CFO Andy Campion told analysts on a call Tuesday.

The latest quarter did not include September, when the company made Kaepernick a face of its ""Just Do It"" campaign.

The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, who has not played in the NFL since the 2016 season, sparked a firestorm when he sat and later knelt during the National Anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice. President Donald Trump even rebuked Nike after the campaign launched, asking, ""What was Nike thinking?"" on Twitter.

Nike's decision was a bet on its core customers: Younger Americans in big cities. More people aged 18 to 34 supported the Kaepernick ad than those who opposed it, according to an SSRS Omnibus poll provided exclusively to CNN earlier this month.

Tuesday's results gave another sign that Nike made the call from a position of strength.

Nike didn't bring up Kaepernick during its call with analysts. But CEO Mark Parker was asked whether he was concerned about the controversy.

""We feel actually very good and very proud of the work that we're doing with 'Just Do It,'"" Parker said. ""We've seen record engagement with the brand as part of the campaign.""

Nike, the world's largest sports footwear and athletic company, has reinvented itself for the digital era. Nike wants to sell more shoes and clothes directly to consumers, instead of through retailers. These sales carry higher margins and also give Nike total control over how its products are displayed and marketed.

""Nike is in the early innings of a transition from a traditional wholesaler to a retail tech company,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report last month.

The company has taken several steps toward its goal, including narrowing its focus to a dozen major cities, cutting out struggling retail partners and relaunching its membership app, NikePlus.

Nike's tactics appear to be working so far. Digital sales jumped 36% last quarter compared with a year earlier.

The company is also getting its flagship products right. Shoes like Nike React, Air Max 270, VaporMax, and ZoomX have landed with customers.

""The success we're seeing today starts with great products. It's ultimately where the consumer cast their vote. Our innovation platforms are building a foundation for growth over many years,"" Parker said."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180925085813-nike-kaepernick-effect-780x439.jpg
b1c2e05e2ecd4dc5bef2d1091fe0c833	['Chris Isidore']	2018-09-24 00:00:00	Time is running out for Sears, CEO warns	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Time is running out for Sears, CEO warns	1	"Sears is running out of time to fix its problems, the CEO says.

Eddie Lampert, who controls most of the company's shares through his hedge fund, told the board on Monday that it must address ""significant near-term constraints"" in its cash position.

He cited $134 million in debt payments due October 15.

Lampert has proposed that Sears sell its Kenmore appliance brand, as well as real estate and other assets, to pay down what it owes. In the letter, which was also filed with regulators, he said progress must be made ""without delay.""

Lampert did not use the word ""bankruptcy,"" but he raised the possibility that creditors could be wiped out, a process that often takes place in bankruptcy court, without immediate action.

He also said it was in the best interest of stakeholders to ""accomplish this as a going concern"" — language that suggested the company could be forced out of business.

Lampert's hedge fund is a major holder of Sears debt. In August, he offered to have the hedge fund buy Kenmore for $400 million, and to purchase its home improvement business for as much as $80 million more.

He would like to see Sears sell a total of $1.75 billion in non-real estate assets to raise the cash to pay down debt. He did not identify what other assets could be sold to raise that kind of money.

Lampert also proposes selling another $1.5 billion in real estate. And he would like Sears to restructure about $1.1 billion in debt, persuading some creditors either to accept Sears equity in return or to accept 25 cents on the dollar for what they are owed.

Sears Holdings (SHLD), which owns both Sears and Kmart, has lost $11.7 billion since 2010, its last profitable year. Sales have plunged 60% in that time. But Lampert insists that the company can be profitable again.

Because Lampert is CEO and also proposing to purchase assets, the decision on his proposed debt restructuring rests with the company's independent board members.

The company issued a statement saying it's pursuing the plan outlined in Lampert's proposal, with the advice of legal and financial advisers. But it said it could not make any guarantees.

Sears debt already has the lowest possible credit rating from Standard & Poor's, which suggests it could default on debt within the next six months.

""I don't know if we'd go as far as to say there's a drop-dead date,"" said Robert Schulz, chief retail credit analyst with S&P. ""But it sounds like it's trying to advance on a more accelerated plan."""	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180531162514-sears-store-closing-780x439.jpg

The move, announced Tuesday evening, was unanimously approved by the board of directors.

""I think I speak for all Board members when I say I look forward to learning more about CBS' compelling opportunities and how we can help guide and support the company's growth,"" Parsons said in a statement.

Shari Redstone, whose company National Amusements has the controlling stake in CBS, played a pivotal role in bringing Parsons to CBS. Redstone is consolidating her power now that longtime CBS CEO Les Moonves has stepped down.

Moonves and Redstone were locked in a power struggle earlier this year. Moonves exited the company after two stories by The New Yorker's Ronan Farrow alleged incidents of sexual misconduct in his past. Moonves called the allegations ""untrue"" and suggested that the claims were coming up ""as part of a concerted effort by others to destroy my name, my reputation, and my career.""

His exit on September 9 coincided with the settlement of the litigation between CBS and Redstone. The board was also reshaped at that time.

And the changes continued on Tuesday. Two veteran board members, Bruce Gordon and William Cohen, stepped down, according to the announcement.

According to The New York Times, both men supported Moonves after Farrow's first story came out.

James B. Stewart's story in The Times opened with a quote, attributed to Cohen, staunchly defending Moonves: ""We are going to stay in this meeting until midnight if we need to until we get an agreement that we stand 100 percent behind our C.E.O., and there will be no change in his status.""

According to Stewart's story, Gordon was also initially ""opposed"" to suspending Moonves."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180925213242-dick-parsons-may-2018-780x439.jpg
5abfbc799e664368981298f381f61c66	['Brian Stelter']	2018-09-25 00:00:00	AT&T, fresh off its WarnerMedia deal, unveils new advertising business	https://www.cnn.com/	US	AT&T, fresh off its WarnerMedia deal, unveils new advertising business	1	"AT&T introduced a new advertising business on Tuesday that seeks to disrupt Google and Facebook's tight grip on the industry.

The division has a new name, Xandr, and a mandate to create a marketplace for targeted TV and online video advertising.

The idea, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said, is that ""if you can make the premium video side operate and behave more like the digital side, people will invest more and be excited about the advertising model on that side.""

In the not-too-distant future, according to AT&T's pitch, TV ads on channels like CNN will be tailored to the viewer who is watching, so a mom with kids will see different messages than a college student.

Numerous other companies are also working on so-called addressable TV advertising. AT&T is unique because it owns a basket of cable channels, through its recent acquisition of Time Warner, and it has a huge number of customer relationships through its wireless division. Time Warner, now renamed WarnerMedia, includes CNN, TNT, HBO, and other brands.

""We have data. We have great content. We have direct-to-consumer distribution. and we have technology,"" Xandr CEO Brian Lesser said.

Lesser, who joined AT&T a year ago to launch this advertising division, revealed the new name while on stage at a conference on Tuesday.

The name Xandr is a nod to Alexander Graham Bell, the founder of the phone company that eventually became AT&T.

Lesser said his goal is a ""premium marketplace"" for buying ads on TV and the web.

In the media industry, there's been a lot of curiosity about AT&T's plans because Google and Facebook have become known as the ""digital duopoly,"" gaining market power at the expense of other players.

Lesser's argument, reiterated on stage Tuesday, is that a robust advertising business is necessary to fund TV production -- to ""fuel the great content being developed.""

Improving the state of TV advertising was one of the tentpoles of the Time Warner acquisition, which took effect in June. ""So far so good,"" Stephenson said when interviewed by CNN's Poppy Harlow on Tuesday morning.

Stephenson said that WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey is working on plans for increased investments at HBO, one of the flagship brands within the portfolio.

Stephenson followed up on his recent comments that Netflix is akin to Walmart while HBO is akin to Tiffany.

He said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon ""called me the next day,"" wanting to know what he meant. ""They're a really big customer,"" Stephenson said as the audience chuckled.

""Look, if I am going to go shop for something, whatever it is, I want to go one place,"" Stephenson said, referring to Walmart and Netflix.

As a streaming service, Netflix has amassed an enormous amount of content.

But HBO's brand is about being the ""premium"" option, he said, citing ""Game of Thrones"" as an example.

At the same time, he said AT&T wants to ensure that ""there's always something new and fresh on HBO,"" thereby reducing the number of people who unsubscribe and resubscribe to the service.

""I think we should aspire to everyday engagement on these platforms,"" he told Harlow.

Stephenson also asserted that the media world is ""averse and reluctant to change"" when it comes to new ways of doing business.

""It's fascinating to me,"" he told Harlow. ""You think of media and entertainment, and how it moves fast, but in terms of business models and changing how you deliver the product, it is an industry that has about as much inertia as any industry I've been involved in.""

He cited past experience with companies like Boeing. He said media is ""a very slow moving industry,"" and he made clear that he'd like to accelerate it."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180925175955-randall-stephenson-march-22-780x439.jpg
9a9dc2c4efb8484a8c2651273efd230f	['Kaya Yurieff']	2018-09-25 00:00:00	Facebook is responsible for Instagram now. It better not mess it up	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Facebook is responsible for Instagram now. It better not mess it up	1	"Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger are out. Now the question is what happens to the business they started, and what that will mean for its owner, Facebook.

Instagram has become an immensely popular platform for young people. It's also been a bright spot for Facebook amid a tumultuous time for that platform, which is grappling with fake news, foreign election meddling and privacy issues. It's unclear what Instagram's future will look like without the original duo at the helm.

While it's not uncommon for founders to leave after their company is acquired, it's notable that Systrom and Krieger stayed on for six years after Facebook purchased their platform for $1 billion. Both founders were still deeply involved with Instagram: Systrom was CEO and Krieger served as chief technology officer. Instagram largely operated as a standalone company within Facebook, and now some of that autonomy could disappear.

""One of the key hallmarks of Instagram has been its independence and uniqueness from Facebook. The founders closely guarded that,"" said Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at eMarketer.

Bloomberg reported that Systrom and Krieger are departing because of tensions with CEO Mark Zuckerberg over the direction of Instagram. According to Bloomberg's sources, Instagram could become more integrated with Facebook now that the co-founders are leaving.

With Systrom and Krieger gone, Williamson says it could be more challenging for Instagram to maintain that independence, especially if Zuckerberg installs his own executives to lead Instagram now.

""Those are signs that [Zuckerberg] definitely wants more Facebook influence on Instagram,"" Williamson said.

That doesn't have to be a bad thing, even for users who prefer Instagram to Facebook. There are some popular features on Facebook that Instagram may be able to adapt. In fact, it's already done this by adding tools like messaging, the ability to mute users and indications showing whether someone is online. It also allows users to post Instagram photos to Facebook, and prompts users to add their Facebook friends on Instagram.

However, Instagram has also rolled out plenty of its own original features -- and copied some tools from other platforms, such as the Stories format, which was pioneered by Snapchat.

And Facebook (FB) will need to walk a fine line. On the one hand, it surely doesn't want to deviate too much from the core Instagram experience that users enjoy; on the other, a social network that doesn't evolve at all can quickly grow stale, and it will need to add new features to stay fresh and competitive.

Facebook needs Instagram to continue flourishing, even without its founders. It may be only be a small part of the overall company's current revenue, but it's key to attracting a younger audience. Instagram has also largely remained insulated from the issues plaguing its parent company, and it continues to grow.

In June, it announced more than 1 billion people use the app each month. Its popular Stories feature -- which lets users post photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours -- is used by more than 400 million people every day, up from 250 million one year ago.

Meanwhile, Facebook user growth is slowing: The platform added 22 million daily active users globally during the most recent quarter, compared to 41 million during the same period last year. Facebook also saw the biggest single-day stock drop in history after its most recent earnings call in July. It warned sales growth may decline as the company prioritizes new formats like Stories and offers users ""more choice around privacy.""

Facebook executives also touted Instagram's growth potential during the company's most recent earnings call. Facebook CFO Dave Wehner said ""Instagram is growing more quickly and making an increasing contribution to growth, and we've been pleased with how Instagram is growing."" COO Sheryl Sandberg also noted ads have ""expanded quite nicely"" to Instagram, and it represents a ""very healthy part"" of growth, which is expected to continue.

""Instagram is an important property. It's still going to be successful,"" said Williamson. ""Facebook will do whatever it can not to mess it up."""	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180925130928-gfx-instagram-founders-leaving-780x439.jpg

Michael Kors (KORS) gained a foothold in the world of elite European fashion on Tuesday by striking a €1.8 billion ($2.1 billion) deal for the storied Italian brand.

Following the deal, Michael Kors will change its corporate name to Capri Holdings, in what it described as a nod to the ""iconic, glamorous and luxury destination.""

Michael Kors said it plans to grow Versace's sales to $2 billion annually, open more stores, improve the brand's e-commerce services and expand its accessories and footwear businesses.

The US company said that Donatella Versace, sister of the fashion house's late founder Gianni Versace, would ""continue to lead the company's creative vision.""

""My passion has never been stronger,"" she said in a statement. ""This is the perfect time for our company, which puts creativity and innovation at the core of all of its actions, to grow.""

The purchase could help Michael Kors compete against rival fashion groups like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (LVMHF) and Tapestry (TPR), the parent of Coach and Kate Spade. Last year, Michael Kors bought London-based shoemaker Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion.

Neil Saunders, managing director of the consultancy GlobalData Retail, said that it was essential for Donatella Versace to remain with the company.

""Her vast experience in luxury retail will be extremely valuable to the new group, especially as it ramps up international expansion,"" he said.

Still, Saunders said there was a ""lot of work to be done"" to boost Versace sales.

""It is notable that synergy savings are not a core part of the announcement today, which is perhaps a recognition of the fact that spending will be needed to create superior growth,"" he said.

Shares in Michael Kors were flat. The stock plummeted 8% on Monday following reports that the Versace deal was imminent."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180925135151-versace-store-chicago-780x439.jpg

Insiders at US companies have dumped $5.7 billion of stock this month, the highest in any September over the past decade, according to an analysis of regulatory filings by TrimTabs Investment Research.

It's not a new trend. Insiders, which include corporate officers and directors, sold shares in August at the fastest pace in 10 years as well, TrimTabs said.

The selling is noteworthy because it occurred as the market rebounded sharply from an early 2018 tumble. Fueled by tax cuts and a strong economy, the Dow recently notched its first record high since January.

Some corporate insiders have much of their net worth tied up in stock, so it could be that they are simply exercising caution. The bull market, already the longest history, can't last forever.

""It's a very prudent thing for them to unload some shares -- no matter how much they like the stock,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-partner at brokerage firm Themis Trading. ""It doesn't necessarily mean they see something wrong.""

TrimTabs does not break down how many of the insider sales were pre-planned. The SEC allows executives to schedule stock sales ahead of time to avoid the appearance of insider trading.

While the captains of Corporate America are cashing out, they are doing the exact opposite with shareholder money.

US public companies have authorized a stunning $827.4 billion of stock buybacks in 2018 -- already a record for any year, according to TrimTabs. Apple (AAPL) alone announced plans last quarter for $100 billion of buybacks.

The flurry of buybacks has been viewed by investors as a sign of confidence among CEOs.

""Insiders aren't announcing buybacks because they think stocks are cheap,"" said David Santschi, director of liquidity research at TrimTabs. ""What they're doing with shareholders' money and their own is quite different.""

Companies use buybacks as a way to return excess cash to shareholders. Share repurchases benefit investors -- and executives that are paid mostly in stock -- by providing persistent demand that tends to boost prices. Buybacks also artificially inflate earnings per share by eliminating the number of shares outstanding.

Corporate America is enjoying record profitability thanks to the strong economy and a big reduction in what they owe Uncle Sam. The Republican tax law reduced the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and also gave companies a break on foreign profits that are returned to the United States.

The tax windfall has also enabled companies to spend more on job-creating investments like new equipment and research projects. But buybacks are growing even faster. In fact, Goldman Sachs found that buybacks are garnering the largest share of cash spending by S&P 500 companies for the first time in a decade.

Given the spike in buybacks, Saluzzi said it would be odd if insiders are rapidly dumping shares outside of preplanned transactions.

""You've got to raise your eyebrows and look at what's going on here,"" Saluzzi said."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180926121811-ceos-stock-insider-selling-780x439.jpg

""You're seeing now institutions moving in,"" the founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital told CNN international correspondent Paula Newton on CNNMoney's ""Markets Now"" on Wednesday.

Novogratz pointed out that exchanges and big companies are starting to take the cryptocurrency more seriously.

""Starbucks and Microsoft'll allow you to use bitcoin,"" he said. ""As you see more adoption of just people being comfortable with it, it feels like it's going to go up.""

More institutions will jump on board for fear of missing out, Novogratz said.

""There's an institutional FOMO going on all of a sudden,"" he said.

Eventually, bitcoin may become a part of people's financial portfolios.

""As you start getting custody and service providers in and around the system, it allows pension funds and endowments to get involved.""

He said that over time, more people will start to think of bitcoin as a store of value, like gold.

Galaxy and Bloomberg launched the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index in May. The index tracks the performance of 10 digital currencies, including bitcoin and ethereum.

The price of one bitcoin surged to almost $20,000 late last year, then lost almost two-thirds of its value in 2018.

But Novogratz thinks the cryptocurrency hit bottom earlier this month. He predicts bitcoin will rally 30% by the end of the year. And in the first quarter of next year, ""you'll really start seeing it move.""

While Novogratz is bullish on crypto, he's cautious on cannabis. But he thinks comparisons between the two are fair.

""There's a lot of similarities to crypto of 2017,"" he said. ""There's a limited supply of something that's going to be a major, major theme over the next 5-10 years.""

Shares of the cannabis company Tilray (TLRY) swung wildly last week. Others have surged on reports of investment or interest from big companies like Coca-Cola (KO) and Constellation Brands (STZ).

Novogratz isn't ready to invest yet.

""I'll get in cannabis on a significant sell-off from here,"" he said. When the companies shed about 50% of their value, he'll jump in.

Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, pledged earlier this year to donate the proceeds from the IPO of SurveyMonkey's parent company, SVMK.

SurveyMonkey (SVMK) shares opened for trading at $18.75 -- a 56% increase over the IPO price -- and quickly rose as high as $20. At that price, Sandberg's stake in the company was worth more than $206 million.

Sandberg joined SVMK's board after her husband Dave Goldberg, who ran the company, unexpectedly died while on vacation in 2015. She owns 10.3 million shares, a 9.9% stake in SurveyMonkey.

She plans to donate the shares (or the proceeds from a sale of the stock) to the Sheryl Sandberg and Dave Goldberg Family Foundation.

The donation is part of Sandberg's commitment to the Giving Pledge, the charitable campaign founded by billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates.

Representatives from SurveyMonkey, Facebook (FB) and Sandberg's LeanIn.Org nonprofit group were not immediately available to comment about whether Sandberg sold her shares and would donate proceeds from the sale or gift the stock.

cfac1a96da5f4adfbffd0783af3dbc3f	['Matt Egan']	2018-09-26 00:00:00	GE is worth less than $100 billion for the first time since the Great Recession	https://www.cnn.com/	US	GE is worth less than $100 billion for the first time since the Great Recession	1	"General Electric, once America's most valuable company, is now in sharp decline.

In a year full of dubious landmarks, GE has encountered another: The storied conglomerate is now worth less than $100 billion. That hasn't happened since March 2009 -- during the Great Recession.

GE's (GE) stock crash -- down by nearly two-thirds since the end of 2016 -- has knocked the company down to the 59th most valuable in the S&P 500.

It's a stunning reversal. GE was No. 1 in the S&P 500 as recently as 2004, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. At the time, it was worth nearly $400 billion. Now GE is worth just a tenth of Apple (AAPL), the $1 trillion top dog of the market, and it's fallen behind Salesforce (CRM), PayPal (PYPL) and Nvidia (NVDA).

GE's struggles got it kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average this summer. GE was an original member of the exclusive index in 1896 and had been in it continuously for 110 years.

Plunging profits and mounting debt have driven GE's shares down by 35% this year. Only four S&P 500 companies have had a worse 2018.

The most remarkable part about GE's decline is it comes at a time when the American economy and stock market are soaring. Rival industrial companies including Honeywell (HON) and United Technologies (UTX) are booming.

But GE has been hobbled by years of poorly timed deals and needless complexity that have finally come home to roost. To pay off debt and jump-start the stock, GE is selling off countless businesses, including its century-old railroad division, Thomas Edison's light-bulb unit, Baker Hughes and the health-care unit that makes MRI machines.

Selling in GE's stock has accelerated in recent days because of worries about GE Power, the most troubled part of the slumping conglomerate. GE confirmed last week that two of its gas turbines failed, forcing the closure of power plants.

The turbine trouble could hurt the company's reputation and sales at a time when it's already strapped for cash.

In a statement, GE said that it has ""identified a fix"" and has been working with customers to ""quickly return units to service.""

JPMorgan Chase analyst C. Stephen Tusa, Jr, Wall Street's biggest GE bear, told clients the turbine failure ""raises red flags"" about GE Power.

Others think that shareholders are overreacting. Most likely, GE's ""fundamental technology is sound"" and repair costs will be ""manageable,"" Bank of America analyst Andrew Obin wrote to clients."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180926101913-02-general-electric-power-plant-780x439.jpg

The settlement with attorneys general for all 50 states and Washington, DC, will be split among the states. It's the largest ever multi-state data breach settlement, according to the New York attorney general.

The investigation was called to look into allegations that the ride-share company violated state-level notification laws by intentionally withholding that hackers stole the personal information of 57 million users in 2016.

The breach wasn't disclosed until late 2017, when Uber revealed that it paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data. In April, Uber settled a case with the Federal Trade Commission, which was investigating claims that Uber deceived customers over this breach.

As part of the settlement, Uber has agreed to develop and implement a corporate integrity program for employees to report unethical behavior. It also agreed to adopt model data breach notification and data security practices, as well as hire an independent third party to assess its data security practices.

""This record settlement should send a clear message: we have zero tolerance for those who skirt the law and leave consumer and employee information vulnerable to exploitation,"" said New York attorney general Barbara D. Underwood said in a press release. New York will get about $5.1 million of the payout.

""Our current management team's decision to disclose the incident was not only the right thing to do, it embodies the principles by which we are running our business today: transparency, integrity, and accountability,"" said Uber chief legal officer Tony West in a blog post on Wednesday. ""We'll continue to invest in protections to keep our customers and their data safe and secure, and we're committed to maintaining a constructive and collaborative relationship with governments around the world.""

The settlement comes as Uber attempts to clean up its practices. In July, for example, Uber finally hired a chief privacy officer: Ruby Zefo, became Uber's top executive focused on privacy. Matt Olsen also joined as chief trust and security officer."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180530094830-uber-badge-780x439.jpg

That's good news for the economy	1	"Here's some more good news for the US economy: Transportation is booming.

The Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT) -- the lesser known cousin to the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- has gained more than 9% this year, slightly outpacing the broader Dow's nearly 6% increase.

Investors like it when the twenty transportation stocks in the index are doing well because railroads, truckers, airlines and shippers thrive in a booming economy.

The strength of these companies a sign that consumers are busy shopping and that people have enough money to be flying more often for both leisure and business.

Union Pacific (UNP) and United Continental (UAL), both members of the Dow transports, are near all-time highs.

FedEx (FDX), another index member, will report its latest quarterly results after the closing bell Monday and analysts are forecasting a 10% jump in sales and more than 50% increase in earnings.

The Oracle of Omaha loves planes and trains

Investing guru Warren Buffett continues to be a big backer of many notable transportation stocks too. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has an ownership position in FedEx rival UPS (UPS). it also owns stakes in United as well as airlines American (AAL), Delta (DAL) and Southwest (LUV).

Buffett has even fueled speculation that Berkshire could one day buy an airline. He wrote in his annual shareholder letter this year that he's looking to make ""one or more huge acquisitions"" and followed that up by telling CNBC in February that he ""wouldn't rule out owning an entire airline.""

An outright purchase of an airline could make sense -- especially since Buffett has already shown a willingness to bet big on transportation with the acquisition of railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe for $26 billion in 2009.

President Trump's continued support for the American coal industry is also a plus for the railroads, many of which are big shippers of coal. Union Pacific, CSX (CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NSC) have all outperformed the broader market since the 2016 election.

Still, there are several possible headwinds for the transportation sector in the near-term.

Oil, Amazon and trade wars could end the rally

Rising oil prices could put a dent into profits for truckers and airlines in particular.

Amazon (AMZN) also may be a threat. Although the explosion of e-commerce has helped many transportation companies since they help deliver all those goods we buy, Amazon wants even more control over the shipping process.

Amazon has investments in cargo freight airlines Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) and Air Transport Services Group (ATSG). The Jeff Bezos-led company has also been experimenting more with drone deliveries.

Trade tensions could hurt the transportation sector. More tariffs against China (not to mention numerous other US trading partners) could be bad news for transportation companies if it leads to less demand for shipping imported goods.

But for now, investors seem to be shrugging off concerns about the Trump administration's trade war and are focusing instead on the continued strength of the US economy."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180917093228-truck-dow-transportation-780x439.jpg

The automaker announced Sunday that it would focus on hybrid and electric technology and will no longer make diesel-powered vehicles.

The announcement comes five months after a senior manager at Porsche in Germany was arrested in connection with an investigation into diesel emissions rigging by Porsche's parent company, Volkswagen.

Just 12% of Porsche's global sales came from diesel cars in 2017. The company hasn't had a diesel car in its portfolio since February and hasn't offered a diesel model in the United States since November of 2015, a Porsche spokesperson told CNN.

Porsche said in a press release that demand for electric and hybrid vehicles has soared, but the market for diesel is shrinking.

""Due to this change in conditions, the company has decided to no longer offer diesel propulsion in future,"" the company said.

Oliver Blume, chief executive of Porsche AG, said in a statement that Porsche ""is not demonizing diesel.""

""It is, and will remain, an important propulsion technology. We as a sports car manufacturer, however, for whom diesel has always played a secondary role, have come to the conclusion that we would like our future to be diesel-free,"" he said.

Diesel has never been a major part of Porsche's portfolio. The automaker offered diesel versions of some of its four-door models, but the company has stuck to gasoline for its sports cars.

In its press release, Porsche touted the introduction of the Taycan, the brand's first all-electric model that will compete with Tesla in the luxury EV market. The Taycan will debut in 2019.

""By 2025, every second new Porsche vehicle could have an electric drive -- either hybrid or purely electric,"" the company said.

Volkswagen became the center of an explosive scandal about two years ago for rigging diesel cars to cheat environmental regulation tests. It led to the ouster of its CEO and a string of legal battles in the United States and abroad.

But for Jason and David Drew, it's business.

The two brothers own a company in South Africa that gets flies to lay hundreds of millions of eggs on food waste every day. The larvae are then sold as animal feed.

The Drews' company, AgriProtein, says its maggot meals are an environmentally friendly alternative to fish meal, a widely used animal feed made with ground dried fish.

""We take waste and convert it into our three products — one of which is protein,"" Jason Drew, the company's CEO, told CNN. The others are an animal feed made using oil extracted from larvae, and a fertilizer made with a blend of larvae and garden compost.

AgriProtein was founded in 2008. It raised $105 million in its most recent round of funding this year and is valued at more than $200 million, according to its founders.

'Nutrient recycling'

Jason's eureka moment certainly wasn't glamorous. In 2007, having sold his telecommunications business a few years earlier, he embarked on a passion project to ""follow food chains around the world.""

Seeing waste tips surrounded by flies, he realized the insects' larvae were an untapped source of protein.

The Drews say they have been fascinated with insects ever since they used flies and maggots to go fishing as children at their grandparents' home in England. Combining that interest with a desire to make food supplies more environmentally sustainable, they began researching the science behind insect farming.

""We call it 'nutrient recycling,'"" Jason said. ""[We are] recycling waste nutrients into natural protein for chicken and fish.""

Today, AgriProtein has fly factories in Cape Town and Durban. Each factory contains 8.4 billion flies, and takes in 276 tons of food waste every day. The flies lay 340 million eggs on the waste each day.

'Exciting times for humanity'

Making meals out of maggots took a while to succeed.

""We spent nearly five years in abject failure,"" Jason said. ""If I had known how hard it would be, and how much it would cost, I would probably not have started.""

The brothers received two grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to help fund their research, but they found it harder than expected to master techniques for increasing the number of larvae and keeping them alive for long enough. They also encountered problems keeping costs under control as they tried to grow the business.

But finally, things started to click.

AgriProtein hired its first employee in 2009 and now has 145. Last year, it signed a $10 million deal with engineering firm Christof Industries to set up 100 fly factories worldwide by 2024. The company plans to roll out facilities in Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the United States.

The fledgling industry is growing, according to Jason.

""It is exciting times for humanity as we start to tackle waste and protein problems,"" he said."	https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180904113713-01-agriprotein-780x439.jpg

""Today it became clear that America is alone,"" Rouhani said at a press conference in New York, adding that other world leaders told him they disapproved of President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the nuclear deal that eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.

""They referred to the American action as an incorrect action,"" Rouhani said. Using sober and measured language, Rouhani added that Iran's ""intent is to ensure that the United States of America abides by laws and stops bullying, stops pressuring, maintains commitments... [and] adheres to the United Nations Security Council resolution"" that oversees the nuclear deal.

Rouhani spoke a day after Trump and his senior officials assailed Iran for its actions in the Middle East and called on other nations at the UN General Assembly to help it squeeze and isolate Tehran.

'Chaos, death and destruction'

National Security Adviser John Bolton warned Tuesday that if Iran doesn't change its behavior it will "" have hell to pay ."" Trump used his speech to the UN Tuesday to ask ""all nations to isolate Iran's regime"" and its leaders who ""sow chaos, death and destruction.""

On Wednesday, while hosting a meeting on non-proliferation, Trump added a warning. ""Any individual or entity that fails to comply will face severe consequences,"" he said.

""We're not isolated,"" Rouhani said Wednesday, saying that every world leader he has met while in New York praised Iran for staying in the nuclear deal despite the US departure and pressure campaign.

He pointed to an effort by the European Union, France, Germany, the UK, China and Russia -- the remaining signatories to the nuclear deal -- to create a mechanism to help Iran trade and avoid US attempts to choke its economy.

""In the General Assembly, America was isolated ,"" he added, referring to Trump's speech Tuesday. ""Everyone opposed their move, everyone supported"" the nuclear deal, Rouhani said. ""We are not alone. The Americans are alone and isolated."" Their efforts to isolate Iran, he said, were ""neutralized.""

Asked about the escalating American rhetoric against his country, Rouhani threw in a dig at Trump and his diplomatic team, indicating he thought they lacked polish and experience. ""They speak with a different style, presumably because they're new to politics and have not been practiced in the field of politics,"" Rouhani said. ""Those who are used to politics, their tone and language is different.""

Rouhani did not mention Secretary of State Mike Pompeo by name, but alluded to some of his Tuesday remarks about the need for Iran to change. ""The one who has been newly appointed Secretary of State, he wasn't a diplomat before this,"" Rouhani noted. ""What he said was not diplomatic at all.""

Pointing to the administration's policies on immigration and Palestinians, Rouhani said they suggest an ugly motivation. ""The current comportment of the current administration toward Muslims and particularly Palestinians... makes one think about racist comportment and behavior,"" Rouhani said.

Rouhani sidestepped questions about American hostages held in Iran, or dual citizens who have been imprisoned while on visits to Tehran, but over the course of an hour's remarks to reporters, he repeatedly returned to his theme that the Trump administration is violating more than one international law.

'Strange, unprecedented'

He noted that US troops are present in Syria despite the fact that the regime of Bashar al-Assad does not want them there. ""America in Syria, the presence is illegal,"" he said. More complicated, Rouhani said, is the fact that the US is now threatening to punish other countries if they don't join it in ignoring the UN resolutions that govern the nuclear deal.

""It is quite strange, unprecedented,"" that the US is asking members of the Security Council ""to not adhere to a resolution from that same Security Council, voted on by the US, all members voted in favor,"" Rouhani said, but now ""whoever adheres to that resolution will be punished.""

""We say do not sanction illegally and unfairly,"" Rouhani said. ""If America returns to abiding by laws we have no problem with them.""

He admitted that Iran is feeling some pressure, but said the country ""has been in situations that are much tougher"" and ""has been able to surpass such difficulties in the past, just as it will be able to do today.""

In the meantime, Rouhani said his country has ""lived up to every single commitment"" of the Iran deal and ""until such time"" as they ceased to reap the benefits of the deal, ""we will remain in the agreement.""

""Should the situation change,"" he added, ""we have other paths and other solutions which we will embark upon.""

For now, though, Rouhani made clear that Iran is not looking for a clash with the US. ""We do not wish to go to war with American forces anywhere in the region,"" he said. ""We do not wish to attack them, none of the above, but we ask the United States of America to adhere to laws and respect national sovereignty of nations.""

Rouhani also predicted that despite the Trump administration's departure from the nuclear deal in May, Washington would eventually come back.

""The United States of America one day will come back, sooner or later,"" Rouhani said. ""This does not benefit the Iranian people, it does not benefit the American people or Europe."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180925144104-hassan-rouhani-nuclear-deal-amanpour-00051011-super-tease.jpg
05ffca7d97ec47f0a455f8181d80b831	['Analysis Nick Paton Walsh']	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Iran can afford to play a waiting game with Donald Trump	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Iran can afford to play a waiting game with Donald Trump	1	"(CNN) Not long after the rest of the world had openly laughed at his boss as he addressed the United Nations General Assembly, US National Security Advisor John Bolton mustered his best Jacobean menace on Tuesday .

""According to the mullahs in Tehran, we are 'the Great Satan,' lord of the underworld, master of the raging inferno,"" he said on the margins of the UNGA Tuesday.

""So, I might imagine they would take me seriously when I assure them today: If you cross us, our allies, or our partners; if you harm our citizens; if you continue to lie, cheat, and deceive, yes, there will indeed be HELL to PAY.""

Those are his block capitals and this is his preferred fire-breathing role.

But where is US policy on Iran?

Consider that at the same time as Bolton was breathing fire, President Trump was tweeting -- albeit to pre-emptively reject an Iranian invitation to meet that was apparently never made -- that he is sure Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ""is an absolutely lovely man!""

In truth, US policy on Iran is not devastatingly complicated.

Trump, the ultimate dealmaker, thinks he can continue to squeeze Iran with the slow choke of sanctions, holding out the option of a one-on-one, Art of the All-Encompassing Deal meeting between himself and President Rouhani.

He believes that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's wish list of 12 ways in which Iran needs to change, coupled with block-capital threats, will eventually see Tehran's influence diminished in the Middle East.

But this is a policy perhaps too simple to meet the challenge. The nuclear deal stemmed from the calculus that the US couldn't really afford a third war in that region. Therefore, tackling the concern of Iran's nuclear program with a separate deal was the best bet. Empower moderates by permitting a little globalization and reform in Iran and it may soften by itself, or so went the Obama administration's thinking.

None of this calculus has changed. And barring some madcap escalation or Iranian rush to enrichment, Pentagon chief James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are likely to keep cool enough heads to prevent any sudden direct US military action.

What has changed, however, is the credibility of the US. Foreign policy is for Trump a distraction that he appears to dip in and out of when his domestic crises mount.

It's where the bluster of the showman is at its most terrifying, as lives and military action are in the balance. But if you were in Tehran observing Trump's bipolar and largely ineffective attitude towards North Korea -- which actually has nukes that might one day hit the United States -- it would be tempting to sit, wait and do nothing.

This appears to be the tacit approach of Iranian officials, who see a White House that is struggling to explain its President's Twitter account as the Russia investigation swirls.

Why make a deal with hardliners who may not be around for long -- and are certainly distracted while they are in the White House? The Iranian position remains that the old deal stands, is backed by a UN resolution and is the unassailable rock from which any other talks stem.

The White House's bluster and unilateralism may have conjured the worst of all worlds.

First, the Iranian moderates who signed the deal now risk ceding internal ground to hardliners. Witness the recent appearance of President Rouhani in the cockpit of Iran's first domestically-produced jet fighter.

Second, Iran continues to consolidate its position in Syria, cementing military partnerships with the Assad regime. The Pentagon can only respond by staying around in Northern Syria -- by doing more of the same, rather than leaving months down the line.

Third, the European allies (and Russia) -- whose unity under the Obama administration made the deal so effective -- are going their own way.

JUST WATCHED Mogherini: Is war the alternative to Iran diplomacy? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mogherini: Is war the alternative to Iran diplomacy? 10:04

Indeed, they are striving to create a ""Special Purpose Vehicle"" to insulate European companies that want to trade with Iran from being hit by US retaliatory sanctions. It isn't clear how this will work, nor whether any company would still choose risking its access to the US market to retain its hold in the Iranian one.

But the message is politically clear enough: the EU is willing to do unprecedented things to keep the deal alive. Bolton himself conceded that the EU ""is strong on rhetoric and weak on follow through,"" adding truthfully that the ""structure ... does not exist yet and has no target date to be created.""

But make no mistake, there is a clock fiercely ticking in Tehran. The economy there is in a mess, with the local currency tumbling. While a lot of that is down to internal mismanagement so profound that ministers have lost their jobs, Trump's constant threats to restore sanctions expedited that fall.

The Iranian economy is resilient and has endured years of pressure. But on a recent trip there, I could sense the market trader's fury mount at being unable to pay their rent or know what next week's food prices would be.

So the question remains: who falls first?

Iran's moderate government, undermined by clumsily-renewed sanctions and the failed promise of a nuclear deal? Or the Trump administration, whose domestic scandals rage and mushroom to the point they appear to blur into a daily patina of chaos?

The Iranians have been here before -- a senior official reminding me that Republican hardliners are nothing new to them. Neither are softer approaches from subsequent Democratic US presidents.

Perhaps the fury expressed by Pompeo -- when he noted that his predecessor, John Kerry, had reportedly advised the Iranians just to wait out the Trump administration -- was so acute, because Kerry had a point.

The nuclear deal is technically alive in all but American hearts. Sanctions are biting. But symbolically, Iran has not been abandoned by its European allies and may find ways to persevere.

Iran retains considerable influence in the Middle East, keeping its military hardliners happy enough. And the Trump administration appears to be daily on a survival footing, with its figurehead being openly laughed at by the rest of the world.

Why not wait? No deal Iran signs now will be better than the it currently already has.

The convict, identified as Ibrahim A., was found guilty of ""torture and killing persons protected under international humanitarian law"" as well as ""murder, extortionist kidnapping and the commission of war crimes under the International Criminal Code.""

The 43-year-old commanded a 150-member armed group known as Ghoraba as-Sham which operated under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) umbrella group, according to court documents.

Over the course of Syria's nearly eight-year war, Western nations have aided and trained members of the FSA, who have been considered ""moderate opposition"" amid a rebel landscape that has become increasingly dominated by extremists such as ISIS and al Qaeda.

The FSA, which began as a group of Syrian soldiers and officers who defected from the Syrian army, is an association of over a dozen rebel groups fighting the Russian-backed government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The group has taken over whole neighborhoods, and sometimes cities and provinces, during the war. Many FSA-held territories have been recaptured by Syrian government troops over the years.

The move, announced by the Russian Defense Ministry on Monday, has drawn criticism from Israel, which regularly conducts airstrikes in Syria against what it says are Iranian targets. In a tweet Monday, United States National Security Adviser John Bolton called the Syrian government's purchase of Russia's S-300 air defense missiles ""a significant escalation.""

Russia's Defense Ministry has said the system would be transferred to Syria in the next two weeks.

The ministry said that Israel was ""solely"" to blame for bringing down the IL-20 aircraft last week. The plane was inadvertently shot down by Syrian forces during an Israeli airstrike in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia. Russia's military accused Israel of maneuvering its aircraft to use a Russian plane ""as cover,"" putting it in the line of fire of Syria's antiaircraft system.

Russia's military also said that Israel provided misleading information about the airstrike over a military hotline. The two countries follow a de-confliction mechanism, keeping each other informed about their military actions in the country.

Israel's military denied the accusations and said it followed established protocols in communicating with Moscow, presenting full information about the incident to Russia in an after-action review. In a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held the Syrian government and its Iranian allies responsible for downing the Russian plane.

""Transferring advanced weapons systems into irresponsible hands will increase the dangers in the region,"" Netanyahu said during the phone call in response to the announcement. He added that Israel ""will continue to defend its security and its interests.""

But Russia has argued that it had previously withheld the advanced military hardware from Damascus as a favor to Israel. The downing of the plane prompted Moscow to reverse the decision, according to Russia's defense minister.

""In 2013, at the request of the Israeli side, we suspended the delivery of the S-300 complex to Syria which was prepared to receive delivery and for which Syrian military personnel were trained,"" said Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Monday.

""Today the situation has changed. And it is not our fault.""

Making Israeli airstrikes more difficult

Russia has argued that its deployment of the S-300 system would boost the security of its contingent in Syria. The improved radar system enables Syrian surface-to-air missiles to better discern targets and helps prevent the accidental shooting down of Russian planes.

But the new system potentially makes Israeli airstrikes in Syria more difficult. The missile range of the S-300 is around 250 kilometers, allowing defense systems that are set to be positioned in the northern Syrian coastal province of Latakia to cover Israel's northern territories.

Russia's military operates a major airbase in Latakia province, the same region where Israel conducted last week's airstrike.

The Russian military also says it will jam communications and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) over the Mediterranean Sea, which Israeli planes often fly over for their bombing runs.

Russia has served as a power broker in Syria's conflict, intervening on behalf of the Syrian government against rebel fighters while trying to ease Israel's security fears in the country. Last month, Russia said it convinced its Iranian allies to withdraw to at least 85 kilometers away from the Israeli border, relieving Israel of a major security concern.

Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad during a meeting in Sochi on May 17, 2018.

""This is an extremely ungrateful response to all that Russia has done for Israel and the Israeli people recently,"" Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said on Sunday according to Russia's official TASS news agency.

""The Israeli military command either does not value the current level of relations with Russia or does not control certain military units,"" Konashenkov said. He said that during the September 17 attack, Israeli jets approached the Russian IL-20 aircraft as it was preparing to land.""The Syrian air defenses must have taken that maneuver for a new attack by the Israeli air force,"" he said.

""The Israeli fighter jets used the Russian II-20 aircraft as cover against missiles and continued their maneuvers in the area,"" he added. The Russian military also released an animation on its social media pages to illustrate its version of events.

Putin discussed the weapons system delivery with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Monday, according to a Kremlin statement. The Russian leader has refrained from pointing fingers at the Israelis, departing from the rhetoric of the Defense Ministry. Last Tuesday, Putin called the incident part of ""a chain of tragic accidental circumstances, because Israel didn't shoot our plane down."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171121110943-cnnee-vladimir-putin-and-bashar-al-assad-super-tease.jpg

It cited a statement from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that said no effort would be spared in the hunt for those responsible for the terror attack.

The Revolutionary Guards accused Saudi Arabia of supporting perpetrators of the attack that killed 29 people and wounded 70 others. The casualties included both military personnel and civilians, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported.

Sunday, ISIS-affiliated Amaq News Agency began circulating a video that claimed to show three of the four assailants accused of carrying out the attack. But none of the men in the video ever said they were working on behalf of ISIS.

CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the video, which Amaq said it ""obtained.""

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has blamed ""foreign mercenaries "" backed by the United States for the attack.

""It is America who supports these little mercenary countries in the region. It is Americans who are provoking them. It is Americans who provide them with their required necessities to perpetrate such crimes,"" Rouhani said on his official website.

""The government is ready to counter any action by the US, and the Americans will regret this,"" Rouhani said. It was not immediately clear if this remark referred to the Ahvaz attack or the US withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal

""Most importantly, today Americans are bullying the world more than ever and continuing their unilateralist policies,"" he said of the nuclear deal.

The United States will not accomplish ""their goals in Iran,"" he added.

Rouhani made the comments ahead of a trip this week to New York, where he will attend the UN General Assembly.

US dismisses accusations as 'rhetoric'

But Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, rejected Iran's accusations.

""You've got a lot of rhetoric coming from Rouhani. The United States condemns any terrorist attack anywhere, period. We've always stood by that. I think what Rouhani needs to do is he needs to look at his own home base,"" Haley told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday.

""He can blame us all he wants; the thing he's got to do is look in the mirror.""

Despite increased tensions with Iran, Haley emphasized that the United States was not seeking regime change anywhere.

""The United States is not looking to do regime change in Iran. We're not looking to do regime change anywhere. What we are looking to do is protect Americans, protect our allies,"" she said.

""The President has been very strong on Iran. ... Iran's economy has plummeted because the President pulled out of the (nuclear) deal. They're getting desperate. And I think we're seeing the actions of that.""

US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert called the attack ""terrorism.""

""We stand with the Iranian people against the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism and express our sympathy to them at this terrible time,"" she said Saturday.

The parade was part of nationwide celebrations in Iran to mark the 30th anniversary of the end of its eight-year war with Iraq.

Gunmen opened fire on armed forces marching inside a park as well as spectators who had gathered to watch the parade, Iranian armed forces spokesman Brig. Gen. Abolfazl Shekarchi told Mehr, a semi-official Iranian news agency.

All four attackers were killed during clashes with security forces, IRNA reported, citing the deputy governor-general of Khuzestan province, where the attack happened.

Injured soldiers lie on the ground after Saturday's attack on a military parade Ahvaz, Iran.

""The terrorists disguised as Islamic Revolution Guards Corps and Basij (volunteer) forces opened fire to the authority and people from behind the stand during the parade,"" said Gholam-Reza Shariati, governor of Khuzestan province, according to IRNA.

Khuzestan is a province that borders Iraq and has a large ethnic Arab community, many of them Sunni. It was a major battleground during the Iran-Iraq War that killed half a million soldiers in the '80s.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also blamed ""a foreign regime"" backed by the United States for Saturday's attack.

""Terrorists recruited, trained, armed & paid by a foreign regime have attacked Ahvaz,"" Zarif said in a tweet, adding: ""Iran holds regional terror sponsors and their US masters accountable for such attacks.""

Revolutionary Guards spokesman Ramezan Sharif said the attackers were affiliated with a terrorist group supported by Saudi Arabia, Iran's state-run Press TV said.

""The individuals who fired at the people and the armed forces during the parade are connected to the al-Ahvaziya group, which is fed by Saudi Arabia,"" Sharif said. Saudi Arabia hasn't responded to the allegations.

Earlier, Rouhani used the occasion of the military parades to compare President Donald Trump to former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Press TV reported.

Speaking at a military rally in Tehran, he said Trump will fail in the ""economic and psychological war"" he's launched against Iran, just as Hussein failed in his war against the Islamic Republic.

""Iran will neither abandon its defensive weapons nor will reduce its defense capabilities,"" Rouhani said.

""Rather it will increase its defense power day by day. The fact that they are angry at our missiles shows that these are the most influential weapons Iran has.""

Allies and regional governments offer support

Regional governments condemned the attack and offered their condolences, including Hamas, Qatar and a number of Saudi Arabia's reginal allies such as Kuwait, Oman and Egypt. Saudi Arabia was missing from the list of customary diplomatic condolences.

A soldier wounded in the attack is treated Saturday at the scene in Ahvaz.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah, two of Iran's closest allies, issued statements condemning the attack, with Assad referring to outside involvement and Hezbollah echoing allegations of US blame.

""We are with you with all the power we have"" to stand against these terrorist acts, Assad said in a cable to Rouhani, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. ""We hope that the backers, financers and proponents of terrorism will understand that this danger threatens mankind as a whole.""

Hezbollah in a statement said ""satanic and malignant hands are behind this terrorist action,"" and accused the United States and its allies of conducting it ""directly or by proxy."" The attack is intended to undermine Iran's security and stability and as ""punishment for ... its rejection of American dependency politics,"" the statement said.

Iran's Foreign Ministry summoned the ambassadors of the Netherlands and Denmark, along with a senior British diplomat, on Saturday to issue a strong protest, Iran's state-run media reported.

Bahram Ghasemi, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Iran ""re-emphasized"" to the diplomats a previous warning about the presence in their countries of a group that Iran classifies as terrorist and wants its members arrested and prosecuted.

According to IRNA, Ghasemi said it is unacceptable that members of a terrorist group be allowed in those countries and not be included on the European Union's terror list only because they have not committed crimes on European soil.

There was confusion Sunday as for who carried out the attack , with several groups named in local media but only ISIS claiming responsibility -- without any evidence to support its assertion.

The separatist Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz issued an emphatic denial after IRNA reported it had claimed responsibility.

""On behalf of #PADMAZ organization we reject all accusations and we insist that PADMAZ organization is a civil political movement and has nothing to do with what (happened) today in #IranMilitaryParade attack,"" the group, using its acronym, said on unconfirmed Twitter and Facebook accounts.

""Terrorists recruited, trained, armed & paid by a foreign regime have attacked Ahvaz,"" he tweeted as the news broke.

Exactly which group carried out the attack was unclear on Sunday with confusion after several groups were named by local media outlets. The radical Islamist group ISIS also claimed responsibility, as it invariably does, most likely for a quick propaganda coup. The terrorist group offered no proof.

A local Sunni separatist group, Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz , issued an emphatic denial after the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported it had claimed responsibility for the attack.

Another group, the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Al-Ahwaz, was also accused of perpetrating the attack but its spokesman, Yacoub Hor Al-Tustari, told CNN his group was not to blame.

A spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corp fueled the finger-pointing, saying it was terrorists backed by Saudi Arabia. In his tweet, Zarif said ""US masters"" were behind the attack. Saudi Arabia has yet to respond to the allegations.

The attack comes at a time when relations between Riyadh and Tehran are increasingly febrile.

Whoever is responsible for the killing of Iranian troops and civilians at the military parade -- and we may never know for sure -- may have lit the touch paper on a dangerous escalation of tit-for-tat terror.

Iran has accused Saudi Arabia of backing terrorist attacks before, but not attacks of this magnitude.

It is also unusual for an attack of this scale inside Iran, and unusual that so many soldiers should be killed.

The fact that the attack happened at a military parade to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the eight-year war with Iraq that killed as many as half a million troops strikes a deep wound in the pride of the Iranian state.

The stakes for the theocratic regime -- already battling an undercurrent of popular unrest over rising inflation and uncertainty -- are high.

A man and a boy run to escape from the barage of gunfire in Ahvaz.

Foreign Minister Zarif's tweet went on to threaten revenge. ""Iran holds regional terror sponsors and their US masters accountable for such attacks. Iran will respond swiftly and decisively in defense of Iranian lives,"" he wrote, reflecting his government's frustrations.

His language, however, appears to play directly into US President Donald Trump's hands.

In just a few days, at the United Nations General Assembly, Trump plans to host a UN Security Council meeting where, according to US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, Trump will ""address Iran's destabilizing aggression and sponsorship of terrorism.""

Iran's growing influence

The question has to be, why this attack, and why now?

To find the answer, it is perhaps necessary to look at recent reminders of Iran's growing influence and threat in the region.

The Shia theocracy has become more ingrained in Iraq's institutions and more entrenched in Syria. Most worryingly for Israel's leaders, who consider Iran an existential threat, Iran's biggest proxy, Hezbollah, is gaining strength just over Israel's border in Lebanon.

Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah capped 10 days of Shia celebrations with a speech announcing that he now possesses ""precision missiles"" capable of accurate strikes deep inside Israel.

But the event whose timing most seems to invite retaliation, if that's what the Ahvaz attack was, was an Iranian attack earlier this month on the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan , an anti-Iranian group deep inside Iraqi territory.

The artillery assault September 8 on the Iraqi Kurdish town of Koysinjac was blatant and brutal. Iran made no effort to hide its hand behind the shells that rained down.

Several of the anti-Iranian groups' headquarters buildings were destroyed and many of its troops killed in a sustained barrage of fire on a number of locations in the town.

The group threatened retaliation -- that was two weeks ago -- possibly a large enough window for someone to plan and prepare a counteraction.

In the maddeningly confusing mélange of fighting groups under arms in Iraq and Syria right now, it has become almost normal that some are backed by regional and international powers, including the United States.

In that climate, an avowedly anti-Iranian group in Iraq, such as the one targeted two weeks ago, can expect to have local allies in Iran and even unwitting or possibly witting international benefactors -- even if there are no official lines of command, control and responsibility.

Simply put, Iran's strike outside its border in Koysinjac may have sent a message back across the border to affiliated anti-Iranian sympathizers.

If this is the case, and there is no evidence to show that it is, then Saturday's attack in Ahvaz won't be the end of the story.

And even if it's not, Iran is still going to want revenge.

The UNGA next week, whatever Trump says, is unlikely to break what threatens to become a destabilizing cycle of cross-border attacks."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180922130322-01-iran-attack-0922-super-tease.jpg

The dead and wounded were both military personnel and civilians including a journalist who were watching the parade, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) added.

""Terrorists began shooting from a long distance while inside the park, at the armed forces as well as civilians watching the parade,"" Brig. Gen. Abolfazl Shekarch, a spokesman for the Iranian armed forces told Mehr, a semi-official Iranian news agency.

Three of the attackers were gunned down during clashes with the security forces and one other was arrested, news agencies reported.

Wounded soldiers lie on the ground after the attack on the military parade.

The separatist group Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz claimed responsibility for the attack, according to IRNA. The group is supported by ""foreign antagonists,"" including Saudi Arabia, the agency said.

""The terrorists disguised as Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) and Basiji (volunteer) forces opened fire to the authority and people from behind the stand during the parade,"" the governor of Khuzestan, Gholam-Reza Shariati, said, according to IRNA.

IRGC spokesman Ramezan Sharif said the attackers were affiliated with a terrorist group supported by Saudi Arabia, Iran's state-run Press TV said.

""The individuals who fired at the people and the armed forces during the parade are connected to the al-Ahvaziya group which is fed by Saudi Arabia,"" Sharif said. Saudi Arabia has yet to respond to the allegations.

Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz later rejected IRNA's report that it had claimed responsibility for the attack.

""On behalf of #PADMAZ organization we reject all accusations and we insist that PADMAZ organization is a civil political movement and has nothing to do with what happen today in #IranMilitaryParade attack,"" the group said on unconfirmed Twitter and Facebook accounts.

The parade was part of nationwide celebrations in Iran to mark the 30th anniversary of the end of the eight-year war with Iraq that started in September 1980 and ended in August 1988.

The attack happened in a province bordering Iraq that has a large ethnic Arab community, many of them Sunni. It was a major battleground during the war that killed half a million soldiers.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also blamed ""a foreign regime"" backed by the United States for Saturday's attack that killed at least eight troops and several civilians.

""Terrorists recruited, trained, armed & paid by a foreign regime have attacked Ahvaz,"" Zarif said in a tweet, adding: ""Iran holds regional terror sponsors and their US masters accountable for such attacks.""

Earlier, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani used the occasion of the military parades to compare US President Donald Trump to the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Press TV reported.

A soldier wounded in the attack is treated at the scene in the southern Iranian city of Ahvaz.

Speaking at a military rally in Tehran, he said Trump will fail in the ""economic and psychological war"" he's launched against Iran, just as Hussein failed in his eight-year war against the Islamic Republic.

""Iran will neither abandon its defensive weapons nor will reduce its defense capabilities,"" Rouhani said.

""Rather it will increase its defense power day by day. The fact that they are angry at our missiles shows that these are the most influential weapons Iran has.""

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah, two of Iran's closest allies, issued statements condemning the attack, with Assad referencing outside involvement and Hezbollah echoing allegations of US blame.

""We are with you with all the power we have"" to stand against these terrorist acts, Assad said in a cable to Rouhani extending condolences, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. ""We hope that the backers, financers and proponents of terrorism will understand that this danger threatens mankind as a whole.""

Hezbollah in a statement said ""satanic and malignant hands are behind this terrorist action,"" and accused the United States and its allies of conducting the attack ""directly or by proxy."" The attack is intended to undermine Iran's security and stability and as ""punishment for ... its rejection of American dependency politics,"" the statement claimed.

On Tuesday, the coalition launched a campaign to recapture the rebel Houthi-held port of Hodeidah , according to state media in the United Arab Emirates, a partner in the coalition.

Save the Children has said that damage to the port or its temporary closure would increase food and fuel costs, putting 1 million more children at risk of famine.

Save the Children International CEO Helle Thorning-Schmidt said the ""nutrition crisis... has serious implications"" for the country's young.

""Millions of children don't know when or if their next meal will come. In one hospital I visited in north Yemen, the babies were too weak to cry, their bodies exhausted by hunger. This could be any hospital in Yemen,"" Thorning-Schmidt said.

""What happens in Hodeidah has a direct impact on children and families right across Yemen. Even the smallest disruption to food, fuel and aid supplies through its vital port could mean death for hundreds of thousands of malnourished children unable to get the food they need to stay alive,"" she said.

'Vital lifeline'

The port is a ""vital lifeline"" for goods and aid for 80% of the country's population, the organization estimates.

""Even the smallest disruption to food, fuel and aid supplies through its vital port could mean death for hundreds of thousands of malnourished children unable to get the food they need to stay alive,"" said Tamer Kirolos, Save the Children's country director for Yemen.

""It could drive up the price of fuel -- and as a result transport -- to such an extent that families can't even afford to take their sick children to hospital.""

Alongside the collapse of the country's currency, the Yemeni riyal, the price of food has doubled in the past few days, Save the Children asserts.

Even as food sits in markets, the prices have meant that increasing numbers of Yemenis are unable to feed their families, it says.

Fuels like gasoline and cooking gas have also increased by 25% in recent months, making it harder for people to travel and feed their families.

Save the Children says as many as 5 million children could be in danger of suffering from famine.

The United Nations has said an assault on the port city could, in the worst scenario, could kill up to 250,000 people. Around 70% of humanitarian aid passes through the Red Sea port.

The military offensive in the province started in June but fighting stalled, especially in Hodeidah, as the UN tried to bring warring parties to the negotiating table.

The latest attempt was in Geneva earlier this month but the Houthis didn't travel as all sides blamed each other for obstructing the peace talks.

A displaced Yemeni girl from Hodeidah carries water containers at a makeshift camp in a village in the northern district of Abs.

'I could see her bones'

Save the Children provided testimony from Yemenis struggling to provide for their families.

A woman identified by the pseudonym Manal said that her infant daughter turned skeletal after she suffered from malnutrition.

""When Suha was six months she became sick,"" she told Save the Children, which also changed the name of her daughter.

""I could see her bones, I could not do anything for her. I had no money for transportation. I had to borrow some money to take Suha to the hospital far away from our village,"" she said. ""Most of the time we eat two meals a day. In the morning we eat bread with tea and for lunch it's potatoes and tomatoes. Usually, I don't eat. I keep it for my children.""

Epidemic looming

Famine is just one humanitarian crisis facing the country's beleaguered civilians. Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the war-ravaged country is teetering on the brink of a third cholera epidemic.

Cases are increasing near the capital, Sanaa, and Hodeidah, where the recent conflict has hindered WHO's efforts to prevent the disease.

""We've had two major waves of cholera epidemics in recent years, and unfortunately the trend data that we've seen in the last days to weeks suggests that we may be on the cusp of the third major wave of cholera epidemics in Yemen,"" Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, told a UN briefing in Geneva, Switzerland.

More than 1.1 million suspected cholera cases have been recorded in Yemen since April 2017, according to the latest WHO figures , with more than 2,300 associated deaths.

Displaced Yemeni children look on in a camp set up for people who fled the battle areas east of the port city of Hodeidah.

Children killed in airstrikes

The Saudi-led coalition has also been accused of killing civilians, some of them children, including in a devastating attack on a school bus in August.

The bomb used in that attack was a 500-pound (227 kilogram) laser-guided MK 82 bomb made by Lockheed Martin, sold as part of a US State Department-sanctioned arms deal with Saudi Arabia, munitions experts told CNN

Speaking alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at talks in Sochi on Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the creation of a 15- to 20-kilometer (approximately nine to 12 miles) demilitarized zone will prevent a ""humanitarian crisis"" in the northwestern province.

All heavy military equipment tanks, ground-to-air missiles and mortars of all the opposition groups will be removed by October 10, the leaders said. The zone, which will be patrolled by Turkish and Russian military units, will become operational from October 15.

Erdogan described the agreement as a ""solution"" to the issues in the region.

""Russia and Turkey will both have coordinated patrol activities on both sides of the border at the demilitarized zone,"" Erdogan said.

""With this agreement, I believe that we will prevent a big humanitarian crisis in Idlib,"" Erdogan added.

Preparations for government offensive

In recent weeks, Syrian and Russian planes have conducted scores of airstrikes in Idlib in the run-up to an anticipated offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces to retake the last part of the country under armed opposition.

In a report Friday, Amnesty International accused the Syrian government of using outlawed cluster weapons and unguided barrel bombs in the attacks against the opposition groups.

Armed groups in Idlib province -- increasingly dominated by Islamist extremists -- have since early August been arresting people who promote and pursue reconciliation and surrender agreements with the Syrian regime, according to statements from members of the opposition, the armed groups themselves and an Idlib-based activist who talked to CNN last week.

Last week, UN officials said that more than 30,000 people fled the province in anticipation of the government offensive.

On Tuesday, the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura welcomed the Russia-Turkey agreement and said that the plan should be ""expeditiously"" put in place. In a rare remark, the UN envoy said that ""for now we are pleased.""

Syria 'welcomes' agreement

Speaking about the Sochi agreement Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu said that civilians and opposition members would be allowed to stay in the demilitarized zone, while ""terrorist groups"" and heavy weapons would be removed.

""The normal light weapons in the hands of moderate opposition forces will remain,"" the minister said during a press conference with his Jordanian counterpart in Ankara, adding that Turkey will send more troops and will keep its 12 observation posts in Idlib.

The Syrian government welcomed the Russian-Turkish agreement over Idlib but said it will continue its ""war on terrorism until it liberates every inch of Syrian territory, whether by military operations or local reconciliation deals.""

""We welcome every initiative that stops the Syrian bloodshed,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement carried by the official news agency SANA.

The agreement met with mixed reactions from some of Idlib province's 30 million inhabitants.

Abdullah Ibrahim, who lives in the city of Andan, told CNN the agreement was ""worst of the best possible options,"" citing bilateral agreements that failed in the past.

""There is a great fear because Syrian regime forces and Russian forces are always violating all agreements that have been signed in the past. So this one won't be different and (it will be) a matter of time before this agreement fails and things will be ugly again,"" Ibrahim said.

Activist Zaher Abu Jaber told CNN that people living near the buffer zone are continuing to gird themselves for an onslaught.

""People are really afraid near the front lines in Southern Idlib, where these deescalation zones will be implemented. People are still digging caves and preparing for the worst, especially in the areas of Kafr Zayta and Latamneh where most of the bombing earlier this month took place. The residents don't trust the Russians at all,"" he added.

The agreement came on the same day that a Russian military aircraft was inadvertently shot down by Syrian regime antiaircraft artillery amid an Israeli attack on Syrian positions.

Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said that the downing would not affect the Sochi agreement ""in any way,"" adding that ""this is an important, breakthrough agreement.""

The Russian Defense Ministry ruled out new military operations in Idlib province on Monday, according to Russia's state news agency TASS.

According to the report, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was asked by a journalist if no more military operations were planned to be held in Idlib, to which he replied ""yes.""

Shoigu reportedly added: ""In the hours to come, we plan to make final agreements with them (the Turkish side) on the remaining provisions, which are stipulated in this document."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170503122528-01-putin-erdogan-meeting-0503-super-tease.jpg

Among these natural wonders are mysterious triangular constructions, a beautifully preserved ghost town and elaborate ancient tombs -- the archaeological treasures which Saudi Arabia hopes will earn it a place on the heritage tourism map.

This other worldly landscape is Al-Ula county. Covering nearly 9,000 square miles (22,500 sq km), in north-west Saudi Arabia, it is about the same size as New Jersey.

Team members say they have already identified thousands of archaeological sites, found evidence suggesting that people have lived in the area for much longer than was previously thought, and encountered bizarre structures, the function and meaning of which are shrouded in mystery.

This carving dates from the period before 6,000 BC, when ostriches lived in Al-Ula. Climate change records show that after this time, the landscape transitioned from savannah to desert. As the environment dried up, the ostriches were driven south to their current range in Africa.

A massive archaeological survey has been launched in Al-Ula county, in north west Saudi Arabia, as the Kingdom prepares to develop the area and open up to mainstream tourism. Covering nearly 9000 square miles (22,500 sq km), Al-Ula county has a dramatic desert landscape.

Al-Ula – A massive archaeological survey has been launched in Al-Ula county, in north west Saudi Arabia, as the Kingdom prepares to develop the area and open up to mainstream tourism. Covering nearly 9000 square miles (22,500 sq km), Al-Ula county has a dramatic desert landscape.

Amr Al Madani, CEO of the Royal Commission for Al-Ula (RCU), which was established last July to drive the development, hopes the region will welcome its first visitors in four years and that by 2035, once the project is complete, up to 1.5 million tourists will visit annually.

To put that in perspective, 464,000 tourists visited Petra, in Jordan, and 5.4 million visited Egypt in its entirety in 2016.

""Al-Ula will be a living heritage, nature and cultural museum -- a destination that both surprises and delights,"" says Al Madani.

The birth of Saudi tourism?

Until now, almost all international visitors to Saudi Arabia have been either business travelers or religious pilgrims, but the government says it is opening up the country to mainstream tourism as part of economic reforms designed to end its dependency on oil exports, outlined in its Vision 2030 plan.

As well as Al-Ula, the Kingdom is developing a string of resorts along the Red Sea coast , and a Six Flags-branded theme park in Riyadh. However, a tourist visa that had been expected to launch in April has not yet been released -- a representative of the Saudi government told CNN that regulations are still being reviewed by the Royal Court.

The potential jewel in Saudi Arabia's heritage tourism crown is Mada'in Salih. A collection of 111 spectacular tombs carved into rocky outcrops, and one of four UNESCO world heritage sites in the country, Mada'in Salih was built by the Nabataeans, the same civilization that created the much better-known settlement at Petra in Jordan.

Along with other key sights in Al-Ula, Mada'in Salih is currently closed to the public. It will re-open when the RCU has decided how best to showcase its heritage to large numbers of visitors, while ensuring that it is carefully preserved.

Last September, the commission hired Rebecca Foote, a London-based American archaeologist, to establish an archaeology and cultural heritage department. Her first project is the survey: its aim is to identify and document all remains of past human activity, and create an inventory that will help to determine which sites merit further study, conserving and being developed for tourism.

""It's an extraordinary opportunity,"" says Foote. ""You rarely get the chance to carry out a best-practice, state-of-the-art integrated survey on such a large scale and in a landscape that's largely undisturbed.""

Down in the valley

While Kennedy leads the survey of Al-Ula's ""hinterland"" another group within Foote's team is focused on the project's ""core area."" Covering 1,100 square miles (2,890 sq km), it encompasses a valley -- also called Al-Ula -- hemmed in by sheer-sided mountains that rise 1,000 feet on both sides.

Once rich in water, the Al-Ula valley has channeled people, and trade, along its wide, flat floor for thousands of years.

Early settlements prospered thanks to passing traders transporting frankincense, myrrh and precious stones. Foote says that the first major city here, Dedan -- now called Al-Khuraybah -- was established during the first millennium BC. ""The route from the south to Mesopotamia, Egypt and beyond ran up the western side of the Arabian Peninsula,"" says Foote. Well-trodden paths linked oasis to oasis, like a dot-to-dot drawing. ""The oases provided water for people and animals,"" says Foote, adding that camels -- which can survive with only occasional access to water -- enabled long-distance trading.

The trade route eventually diminished after seacraft that could safely navigate the treacherous Red Sea were developed.

The valley remained relatively quiet for several hundred years and then boomed again, when Islam was established in the Middle East. ""Mecca and Medina became the heartlands of the religion and a destination for pilgrims,"" says Foote. ""Al-Ula lay on the route south from Syria.""

In recent years, archaeologists have conducted research around the core area at Mada'in Salih, Al-Khuraybah and Al-Ula Old Town, a ghost town labyrinth of stone and mudbrick houses which -- according to Foote -- was inhabited from at least the 12th century right up until the 1980s.

But the new survey extends to many areas that have never been studied, and involves the use of cutting-edge technology that is revolutionizing the field of archaeology.

Flying machines

Jamie Quartermaine, who is leading the survey in the core-area, is a pioneer in high-tech archaeology. ""The scale of the work we're doing wouldn't have been possible in the past, using conventional ground survey methods,"" he says.

The process begins with a flight in a light aircraft equipped with a scanner and camera. ""We take very detailed high-resolution photographs from the air,"" says Quartermaine. ""The camera captures objects four inches (10 cms) wide from altitudes up to 5,000 feet (1,500 meters)."" The scanners use LIDAR (light imaging, detection and ranging) technology to shoot laser beams to the ground and calculate the precise altitude of each survey point.

The photographic and LIDAR data is then combined to produce a 3D relief map. ""It's like GoogleEarth but with a much greater level of detail,"" says Quartermaine.

A drone takes photos of Al-Ula's archaeological sites.

Once he has identified promising sites, Quartermaine zooms in with drones fitted with powerful cameras. Finally, the team goes in by land. ""We use 4X4s to visit sites identified from the air to verify, describe, sketch and photograph them,"" he says.

Ground research, says Quartermaine, is the only way to see rock art and text found on vertical rock faces that are not visible from above. His team do not have the time or resources to translate the texts, which are written in numerous languages including Aramaic, Arabic, Nabataean, Greek and Latin. Others will do that later.

The rock art, however -- some of which pre-dates the written word -- is already yielding information. ""There are pictures of giraffes, ostriches, one elephant, lots of camels and hunting scenes, "" says Quartermaine.

The animals provide clues to the age of the artworks. ""The giraffes and ostriches date from the period before 6,000 BC, when those species lived here,"" he says. ""Climate change records show that after this time, the landscape transitioned from savannah to desert. As the environment dried up, these animals were driven south to their current range in Africa.""

Desert discoveries

The level of preservation in Al-Ula is ""staggering,"" says Quartermaine. In the desert, the remains have not been subjected to water erosion and with so many stones lying around, manmade structures haven't been dismantled for re-use, as often happens elsewhere.

The most commonly found structures in Al-Ula are cairns -- piles of stones that mark graves, sometimes surrounded by low circular or square drystone walls -- which are older than anyone expected.

""We don't have verified dates yet, but it looks as if some may date to at least 4,000 BC,"" says Foote, adding that some may even stretch back to the Neolithic period (10,000 to 4,500 BC). ""It's very exciting because it shows that the history of occupation of the area goes back much further than was known.""

Kennedy has been equally astonished by his discoveries in the hinterland. ""In 10 days of flying, we found around 4,000 sites,"" he says. Some graves in this area are unlike any that Kennedy had seen before, with triangular structures positioned to point towards cairns. Kennedy believes they are unique to Al-Ula. ""We don't know the significance of the shapes,"" he says.

Most enigmatic of all, though, are the ""gates"" -- stone structures that consist of short, wide walls linked by long parallel walls, which look like farm gates when viewed from above. Some in Al-Ula measure 650 feet (200 meters), the length of four Olympic swimming pools. Even larger ones are found elsewhere in the Kingdom.

""Gates are unique to Saudi Arabia. I've never seen anything remotely like them anywhere,"" says Kennedy. ""There are no entry points, and we don't know what they were used for,"" he says, adding that analysis of aerial photos and ground visits might help to reveal their purpose.

Will tourists come to Saudi?

When tourists arrive in Saudi Arabia, Al-Ula's standout attractions are likely to be Mada'in Salih, Al-Ula Old Town and Al-Khuraybah.

Al-Ula Old Town.

Saudi Arabia is collaborating with experts from around the world on the Al-Ula development and in April signed a 10-year deal with France that includes provisions for hotels, transport infrastructure and a world-class culture and art museum.

Al-Madani anticipates that 50% of visitors will come from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region, the other 50% will be from overseas.

But will Saudi Arabia face challenges reconciling international tourism with its conservative Islamic population and values? It has been reported that only women over the age of 25 will be allowed to visit without a male chaperone, and they will be expected to cover their bodies in searing temperatures.

""I think they've got a problem selling Saudi Arabia in competition with, say, Jordan, which is a much more relaxed Middle Eastern society,"" says Neil Faulkner, an archaeologist and historian who leads tours to Jordan and Egypt.

Gina Morello, from Dallas, Texas, toured Saudi Arabia earlier this year -- entering the country on a business visa. She admits to some pre-trip nerves, especially around clothing rules. ""When I saw Western women ... they just had the abayas (long cloaks) on and no head scarf,"" she says, adding that she, too, did not don a headscarf for most of the trip. Wearing an abaya made her feel uncomfortable, however, because of the physical restriction and loss of identity.

""There just weren't a ton of women walking around,"" she says. But people were unexpectedly friendly and warm. ""In one park women wanted to take pictures with us ... doing selfies and the peace sign.""

Al Madani believes that travelers' inherent desire to experience new places will outweigh such concerns. ""Once here, people will enjoy our hospitality and authenticity, be accepting of the local traditions and customs and respect the norms and values of the communities they are engaging with.""

Faulkner says a second barrier is the perception of the Middle East as dangerous, unstable and potentially hostile to Western visitors. ""It has had a huge impact on cultural tourism across the region for the last 15 years,"" he says, adding that the tourist industry has declined even in relatively safe destinations. He believes that Saudi Arabia faces an uphill challenge, pointing to their involvement in the war in Yemen and long-running regional conflict with Iran.

""Security is, of course, an important element in anyone's decision to travel,"" says Al Madani, ""but there have been very few, if any, incidents affecting travelers or tourists in Saudi in recent years, and we will continue to work hard to ensure this remains so.""

Ultimately, he believes that Al-Ula's archaeological treasure trove is strong enough to draw crowds to a country that has long captured the world's imagination."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180523151744-01-triangle-super-tease.jpg

The race to the top has just gotten tighter, with two rising mega-towers in the Middle East battling to become the world's tallest.

Construction has now begun on The Tower at Dubai Creek Harbor , a vast waterfront development, with completion scheduled for ahead of Dubai's Expo 2020 world fair, which kicks off in October that year.

Piercing through a canopy of clouds, The Tower, at 3,045ft (928m), aims to take the title of world's tallest tower, which the 2,723ft-tall (830m) Burj Khalifa , also in Dubai, has held since 2010.

But it's got competition. The Jeddah Tower , in Saudi Arabia, is also slated to finish in 2020.

When completed, this gleaming vertical will be 236ft (72m) taller than Dubai's creation.

If The Tower in Dubai wants the world title, even for a short time, it has to open its doors before the Jeddah Tower.

Ready, steady, go!

Both of these towers are feats in modern engineering.

The Tower , in Dubai, is being constructed by Emaar, the real estate giant also behind the Burj Khalifa, and will anchor the Dubai Creek development, serving -- developers hope -- as a magnet for tourists.

Designed by Swiss-Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava Valls , it will feature The Pinnacle Room -- an observation point offering 360-degree views of the emirate -- and public vertical gardens, while 18 to 20 floors have been reserved for homes, restaurants, shops and a boutique hotel.

If construction runs to schedule, this $1 billion tower will have been thrown up in just three years.

The Jeddah Tower, in Saudi Arabia, will have taken a little longer.

Construction on this graceful arrow to the sky began on April 1, 2013, and was originally slated for completion in 2018, but its opening date has already been pushed back twice. Constructing it will require about 5.7 million square feet of concrete and 80,000 tons of steel, according to the Saudi Gazette



























































1 / 30 – Twisting tall towers of the world 'The Eleventh' towers in New York will stand 300 and 400 feet tall on completion in 2019. The towers will join a growing field of twisted architecture that is making waves around the world.



The Council of Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) recently released a comprehensive list of the world's twisting tall buildings that are either completed or under construction. From Shanghai to Dubai, CNN takes a look at these spectacular spiraled skyscrapers, as well as some of the other tallest buildings in the world. Credit: Bjarke Ingels Group

40 floors off the ground, with 212 left to build -- it's undeniably farther along than the Dubai Tower. This $1.23 billion construction project is, however, already40 floors off the ground, with 212 left to build -- it's undeniably farther along than the Dubai Tower.

But to think Dubai could finish first is not ""as farfetched as it sounds"", according to Jason Gabel, communications manager for the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH).

""The Dubai project is an observation tower, and therefore won't require nearly as much lead time as a full-blown skyscraper,"" Gabel tells CNN. ""2020 is a real possibility for completion.""

Because less than 50% of The Tower's height is occupied by usable floor space, it is defined by the CTBUH as a ""supported tower"" rather than a ""building"".

This technicality precludes The Tower from achieving the distinction of being the world's tallest building. Rather, it would be the world's tallest man-made structure, or tower, until the Jeddah Tower is completed.

The power of a skyline

Home to more than 65 highrises over 656 feet (200m) tall and counting, Dubai has become synonymous with futuristic skyscrapers, and has been a pioneer of this in the Middle East.

""Historically, no Middle Eastern country has come close to building skyscrapers at the rate and height of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but notable pockets of high-rise development are occurring in Qatar, Israel, and Saudi Arabia,"" says Gabel. ""The competitive situation we now see between Saudi Arabia and the UAE very unique.""

Dubai's lofty intentions debuted in 1979, with the 39-story Dubai World Trade Center. It was the city's first high rise, and the tallest building in the Middle East.

Subsequent iconic buildings, such as the Burj Khalifa and the Burj Al Arab , have given Dubai global notoriety.

""Height produces iconicity and visibility on a global stage,"" says Gabel, explaining why Dubai has focused on building big. ""Visibility is itself an asset that can have a positive impact on real estate valuation, investment flows, tourism numbers, and public identity.

""Put simply, structures like this are very expensive upfront, but the benefits of having the 'tallest' are often worth the trouble -- as was the case with the Burj Khalifa.""

Aric Chen, the design and architecture curator M+ visual culture museum in Hong Kong, tells CNN that for emerging economies a skyline can be a powerful communications tool.

""These soaring profiles are in many ways symbolic,"" Chen tells CNN.

""Places like Dubai and, to some extent, places like China, are still trying to put themselves on the map and prove that they have arrived as modern global and technologically advanced nations.""

Testing the tower

The rapid speed at which Dubai can throw up a mega-tower has not, however, escaped criticism.

A series of fires in the past few years, including a blaze that tore through a luxury skyscraper on the Palm Jumeirah artificial island in Dubai this month -- have called into question the quality of some towers, and their fire-proofing.

""Super tall buildings are not unproblematic and there are safety concerns,"" says Chen.

Valls, however, is confident that The Tower will not succumb to such issues.

""Extensive studies were undertaken in preparation for the ground breaking, and the learning that we have gained from the experience will add to the knowledge base of mankind,"" he said in a statement.

Developers have installed multiple damper and shock absorption systems throughout the building, to ensure its stability.

They also completed a series of wind tunnel, climate and seismic tests analyzing 12 scenarios across varying heights to check the behavior of the building under stressful conditions.

""We need to have a balanced and careful look at skyscrapers,"" says Chen. ""But they do serve to again push technologies, and push what's possible.

""We can certainly learn from that experimentation."""	http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161213105713-the-tower-at-dubai-creek-super-tease.jpg

202b9eb5e5804acb8638bb00c949afde	['Darran Simon']	2018-09-26 00:00:00	The creative techniques that rescuers use to find missing children with autism	https://www.cnn.com/	US	The creative techniques that rescuers use to find missing children with autism	1	"When children with autism go missing, rescuers get to know their likes and dislikes, and use familiar sounds to draw them out during the search.

This week, authorities pumped pre-recorded messages from Maddox Scott Ritch's parents into the sprawling Rankin Lake Park in Gastonia, North Carolina -- the last place the 6-year-old boy was seen before he disappeared on Saturday.

Maddox has autism, a bio-neurological development disability that usually appears before the age of 3, and is nonverbal. Autism affects 1 in 59 children, according to the National Autism Association , and more than half are classified as having an intellectual disability or a borderline intellectual disability.

Kids with autism are often prone to wandering or bolting away -- Ian Ritch told reporters that he lost sight of his son when he took off running -- and searching for them is complicated by several factors, including their sensory issues and their likes and dislikes.

Experts said it's important to quickly develop a profile of a missing child to determine what techniques should be used to find them, and to be creative.

""Many of these children are more likely to respond to a favorite character, a unique interest or familiar voice,"" said Lori McIlwain, a co-founder of the National Autism Association. ""It's imperative that first responders always talk to the parents to get a sense of what their particular likes and dislikes are. You could have one child that likes fire trucks and one that doesn't.""

Seven years ago, searchers blasted one of young Joshua Robb's favorite tunes, Ozzy Osbourne's ""No More Tears,"" in an effort find him after he disappeared into the San Bernardino National Forest in California. A rescue team heard some mumbling in the bushes and found the then-8-year-old 24 hours after he ran from his school.

""He was just standing there in a bush, no shirt, no shoes, just in his shorts and was very happy to be found,"" Justin Wheaton, one rescuer recalled in an interview with CNN at the time

Maddox Scott Ritch

McIlwain, an association board member who has a teenage son with autism, said that kind of personalized approach has been successful.

In 2012, she worked with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children to create federal search and rescue guidelines for missing children with special needs that law enforcement use. McIlwain said police officers have even played the voice of cartoon character Elmo in their search.

In some cases, rescuers have been too late.

In 2013, members of the New York City Police Department and other first responders combed the streets playing a recording of Avonte Oquendo's mother calling out to him. The 14-year-old, who was nonverbal like Maddox, was last seen on surveillance video running out of a school on Long Island City on the afternoon of October 4.

Police also deployed dogs, combed surveillance footage and repeatedly searched each of New York City's 468 subway stations because of Avonte's love of trains.

The teenager's remains were found three months later in the East River.

More than a decade ago, Brian Herritt, a California police officer whose son has severe autism, said he realized that other police departments didn't have the skills to deal with people with autism. So he started training them.

Now retired, Herritt said he teaches the first responders and other groups he trains to immediately develop a profile of the missing child, even during the initial call to dispatch. Herritt said time is critical because children with disabilities don't understand the danger they're in and gravitate to dangerous things, such as water or traffic.

The mortality risk for those with autism is twice as high as the general population, largely due to drowning and other accidents, according to the autism association

""Six-year old kids don't go missing forever,"" said Herritt, who is not involved in the search for Maddox. ""He's somewhere, they just have to continue to put resources to find him.""

""I'm sure every officer ... wants nothing more than to find this boy and reunite him with his family,"" he said. ""As a cop, we protect people, and we protect people with special needs more because they need protection."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180923223813-maddox-scott-ritch-super-tease.jpg

This means the 2017-18 season ranks as the deadliest in more than four decades

(CNN) An estimated 80,000 Americans died of flu and its complications last winter, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This means it was the deadliest season in more than four decades -- since 1976, the date of the first published paper reporting total seasonal flu deaths, said CDC Spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund.

In previous seasons, flu-related deaths have ranged from a low of about 12,000 during the 2011-2012 season to a high of about 56,000 during the 2012-2013.

Overall, the United States experienced one of the most severe flu seasons in recent decades. Severity is based on flu activity, hospitalizations, and deaths from pneumonia or influenza, explained Nordlund. She added, ""across the board, last year was definitely bad.""

The season began with an increase of illness in November; high activity occurred during January and February, and then illness continued through the end of March.

""The thing that was most notable about last year was how high in terms of activity things were,"" said Nordlund. She explained that last season, unlike previous seasons, flu did not strike one region of the country and then move across the land. ""There were three consecutive weeks when the entire continental US was affected by flu at a very high level,"" she said.

(CNN) Limiting kids' recreational screen time to less than two hours a day, along with sufficient sleep and physical activity, is associated with improved cognition, according to a study published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health.

The study included about 4,500 US children ages 8 to 11 and measured their habits against the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth . It found that 51% of the children got the recommended nine to 11 hours of uninterrupted sleep per night, 37% met the recreational screen time limit of two hours or less per day, while 18% met the physical activity recommendation of at least 60 minutes of accumulated physical activity a day.

Only 5% of the children in the study met all three recommendations; 30% met none at all.

On average, the participants slept 9.1 hours per night, had 3.6 hours of recreational screen time per day and hit the physical activity goal 3.7 days per week.

The researchers found that as each recommendation was met by a participant, there was a positive association with global cognition, which includes memory, attention, processing speed and language. Those who met all three had the most ""superior"" global cognition, followed by those meeting the sleep and screen time recommendation and finally the screen time recommendation alone, according to the study.

(CNN) For Capt. Mark Wollmershauser Jr. and the Tulsa Police Department, the late-2000s and early 2010s were an extremely dangerous time.

In Oklahoma, a state that is no stranger to the scourge of methamphetamine addiction, those years were the heyday of the ""shake and bake"" method -- a rudimentary way of making meth using just cold medicine, some toxic chemicals and an empty two-liter bottle.

The technique is simple enough that many addicts can cook their own meth, but with one tiny misstep, the chemical reaction that occurs inside can cause deadly explosions

By 2011, Wollmershauser and his narcotics unit were finding and dismantling hundreds of these vessels in meth labs around the city.

A display of items used in the ""shake-and-bake"" method of manufacturing methamphetamine is shown in Oklahoma City. The items shown were purchased for display purposes.

""People were not just burning themselves while cooking meth but were causing damage to other residents that had nothing to do with methamphetamine,"" he said. ""It was a really horrible time.""

When new laws were enacted to limit access to pseudoephedrine -- an allergy drug used in making meth -- the proliferation of these mobile labs waned. After responding to a high of 431 meth labs in 2011, his department encountered just 19 last year.

But Wollmershauser said that didn't spell the end of Tulsa's meth problem. In fact, officials across the state say they are seizing meth that is purer, cheaper and in greater quantities than ever before, with most of it coming from south of the border.

And while much of America is focused on combating the devastating impacts of opioid addiction, some states like Oklahoma are struggling to fight a new battle against an old foe.

The role of Mexican 'superlabs'

Richard Salter has been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for 27 years, most recently as the special agent in charge for the state of Oklahoma.

He said the meth problem in Oklahoma is getting worse, and points to Mexican cartels -- in particular, the powerful Sinaloa cartel -- as the reason.

As it became more difficult and dangerous to produce meth in the United States, cartels recognized an opportunity to fill the void.

""They came in with much purer, much cheaper meth and just flooded this region of the country,"" Salter said.

A Mexican Army expert stands near containers with crystal meth paste at a clandestine laboratory in Mexico's Baja California state. ""Superlabs"" like this one can produce hundreds of pounds of crystal meth daily.

Salter said in 2012, the DEA was buying meth undercover off the streets for $1,100 an ounce. Today, his agents are regularly getting ounces for just $250 to $450.

""That's as cheap as I have ever seen methamphetamine my entire career,"" he said.

The reason for the drop in prices is the scale of production that the Mexican cartels have achieved. Whereas ""shake and bake"" labs could turn out lots of small batches, so-called ""superlabs"" in Mexico produce hundreds of pounds daily.

Salter said most of the meth his agents seize first comes across the US-Mexico border in California or Arizona, before making its way through the interstate highway system and temporary stash houses on its way to Oklahoma.

Along the border, officials with US Customs and Border Protection also report a steep increase in the amount of meth they are seizing.

Anne Maricich, deputy director of field operations for the agency's San Diego ports of entry, said her field office has seen a 50% increase in the amount of meth seized compared to this time last year.

""The other hard narcotics like cocaine, heroin and fentanyl, we see them -- they're prevalent at our border crossings, but nowhere near the quantities that we see of meth,"" she said.

On the streets of Oklahoma, this influx of cheap and powerful meth has had deadly consequences.

The number of lethal meth overdoses in the state has more than doubled in recent years, rising from 140 in 2012 to 335 deaths in 2016. In 2017, there were 327 meth overdose deaths, but that tally is incomplete and the actual number is likely higher, according to Mark Woodward, spokesman with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics.

""There's so much attention -- not just in Oklahoma, but nationwide -- on the opioid crisis,"" said Woodward. ""But our single most deadly individual drug is methamphetamine.""

Perhaps no city has been hit harder by this latest meth epidemic than Tulsa.

In just the first six months of 2018, Wollmershauser said his Special Investigations Division has already surpassed the amount of meth they seized in all of 2017 by 30 pounds.

He can't explain why the problem is more severe here than in other parts of the state, but he doesn't think incarceration is the solution.

There's so much attention -- not just in Oklahoma, but nationwide -- on the opioid crisis. But our single most deadly individual drug is methamphetamine.

Wollmershauser said his department is trying to use more ""front end diversion"" tactics to help addicts get treatment without getting the criminal justice system involved, while also aggressively pursuing the cartels and other large-scale distributors.

While the amount of meth his officers has seized has risen, he said his department is on track to reduce the number of arrests by 40% this year.

""I think we're definitely targeting the right folks that are taking advantage of our city and citizens, but the addiction is strong and it's difficult,"" Wollmershauser said.

How meth fueled a crisis behind bars

Lindsay McAteer's struggles with anxiety and depression led her to self-medicate as a teenager.

At age 14, her boyfriend at the time introduced her to meth.

""I immediately liked it,"" McAteer said. ""It gave me a false sense of identity and a false sense of accomplishment.""

It was the beginning of a 20-year struggle with the drug that nearly ended with a life sentence.

I was losing everything, and meth was able to make me feel like everything was OK, despite the fact that nothing was OK.

After using meth for several years, she said she stopped for a brief period, but after she was laid off from work and had her house foreclosed on, her addiction spiraled out of control.

""I had nothing,"" McAteer said. ""I was losing everything, and meth was able to make me feel like everything was OK, despite the fact that nothing was OK.""

In addition to using meth, McAteer began selling the drug. She was eventually arrested for trafficking and found herself staring at a possible sentence of 12 years to life.

At least 60% of the women in Women in Recovery have seen their addictions lead them to meth, according to the program's executive senior director, Mimi Tarrasch.

But even for those like McAteer who face time in prison, there are sometimes alternatives to a life behind bars. Women in Recovery , or WIR, is an intensive program for women who are looking at lengthy sentences for drug offenses in Tulsa County.

With the door of a prison cell the only other option that was open to her, McAteer entered WIR in August 2014.

Mimi Tarrasch, the executive senior director for WIR, said that many of the program's participants are multi-substance users, but at least 60% have seen their addictions lead them to meth.

""Early on, because it's a stimulant, they feel wonderful and it makes them productive and motivated,"" said Roxanne Hinther, clinical director for WIR. ""But ultimately, they can't take care of their children and they lose everything they have.""

I can say that recovery is definitely possible, and I can say that treatment is the answer versus punishment.

Tarrasch said that most of the women in her program have been battling addiction for 13 to 15 years, which takes a huge toll on their health and wellness, and that of their family. Many have also experienced traumatic events, from childhood abuse to sexual assaults and domestic violence.

Using a range of treatments, training and education, the program gives women who would be spending time behind bars a second chance at a productive and fulfilling life.

McAteer graduated from WIR in 2016 and has now been in active recovery for more than four years. Today, she works as a housing compliance specialist for the Mental Health Association Oklahoma.

Since Women in Recovery began in 2009, 390 women have graduated, with 6.7% of graduates relapsing or falling back into criminal activity.

""I can say that recovery is definitely possible, and I can say that treatment is the answer versus punishment,"" McAteer said. ""It's not foolproof -- I can't say that everyone is able to use this [program] the way it's designed to work, but the vast majority of us do."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180919223606-crystal-meth-paste-mexico-lab-file-super-tease.jpg
a0988369a0634ef78edf9b401cc92021	['Michael Nedelman']	2018-09-25 00:00:00	Gene editing could eliminate mosquitoes, but is it a good idea?	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Gene editing could eliminate mosquitoes, but is it a good idea?	1	"(CNN) Researchers have rendered a population of mosquitoes in a lab sterile using the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 by homing in on a specific target in insect DNA -- the doublesex gene -- raising the possibility of eradicating disease-carrying species of the insect entirely, according to a new study published Monday in Nature Biotechnology .

In the study, scientists at Imperial College London used the technology to wipe out a population of caged mosquitoes that are able to transmit malaria, targeting a genetic sequence that leads to male and female traits. After a number of generations, they found that 100% of these mosquitoes were affected.

""The difference in the gene content between male and female is very, very minimal"" in mosquitoes and humans alike, said study author Andrea Crisanti, professor of molecular parasitology and microbiology at Imperial College London.

Doublesex, as the name implies, controls how mosquitoes differentiate into male and female. Females with two copies of the mutated gene didn't develop properly and couldn't reproduce, while males developed normally and continued spreading the mutation. Mutant females also failed to develop the long, needly proboscis they need to bite humans and suck blood.

What's more, the experiment seemed to succeed where others have failed -- the spread of these mutant genes was not thwarted by the mosquitoes developing resistance.

""We have selected a target site that cannot be mutated or changed by the mosquito without paying a high price,"" Crisanti said.

The researchers note this doesn't necessarily prove their methods are ""resistance proof."" Experts say this could play out very differently outside small, confined spaces and among many other species of mosquitoes -- only some of which carry the parasite that causes malaria.

But even when it comes to suppressing or extinguishing a species of mosquito, are we opening Pandora's Box and releasing something into the world we don't fully understand? Or will the only major impact be a positive one for humans while other organisms -- less harmful ones, ideally -- take these bugs' place in the ecosystem?

""That's an open question,"" said Catherine Hill, professor in the department of entomology at Purdue University. ""We're very interested in protecting human health, but at the same time protecting the environment.""

Hill said we're still untangling how mosquitoes fit into the food web and environment at large. Larvae, for example, are sources of food for some fish -- including the mosquitofish. ""I don't believe that we know the answers to these questions yet,"" Hill said. ""We try to anticipate unintended consequences.""

But a gene like doublesex, while ubiquitous among insects, has evolved differently across species, so it may be possible to launch a genetic attack on one species without affecting another. Experts say the focus, then, is not on swatting down all mosquitoes -- just the small fraction that pester humans and transmit debilitating and deadly diseases.

""There are more than 3,000 species of mosquitoes in the world, most of which do not feed on people,"" Bob Peterson, professor of entomology at Montana State University and vice president of the Entomological Society of America , said in an email. ""It is not practical or desirable -- indeed it's not even possible -- to wipe out all populations of all mosquito species. No one is seriously contemplating that.""

""The African malaria mosquito is the most dangerous animal on earth,"" said Conor McMeniman, assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute. ""New technology that could help to specifically and efficiently control this plague on humanity is welcomed, but I would caution that we need to carefully test this and also engage communities at risk to see what their attitudes are.""

The World Health Organization estimates 216 million cases of malaria in 2016 and 445,000 deaths, with children under age 5 among the most susceptible.

Health experts and entomologists have long been focused on fighting disease-causing mosquitoes, but ""insect pests have the uncanny ability to adapt to and overcome our best efforts to manage them and the harm they cause,"" Peterson said.

In recent years, scientists have infected another mosquito species with Wolbachia bacteria , sterilizing them. Many efforts have traditionally involved insecticides, which are far less targeted and can have detrimental impacts on surroundings and species nearby, McMeniman noted.

While experts are calling the new study a big leap in a positive direction, some anticipate ""growing pains and unexpected results,"" in the words of medical entomologist Donald Yee, associate professor at the University of Southern Mississippi.

""It's going to be nearly impossible to eliminate mosquitoes of any species, given that doing so requires coordinated efforts of governments, scientists, and the public,"" Yee told CNN in an email. ""With very few exceptions in human history, humans just have not been very good at eliminating mosquitoes, even for short periods of time.""

Yee said that the mosquitoes we're really concerned about -- the major vectors for diseases such as yellow fever and dengue -- aren't native to many places where they spread disease to humans. While few studies have held a magnifying glass to mosquitoes' importance to their habitats, he doesn't expect that eliminating them would hugely affect those environments.

Crisanti said he's part of upcoming research on where mosquitoes sit in the food web, as well as how this gene-editing technology will work in spaces that better mimic tropical conditions -- though it could be years before this is ever brought to market.

And time is of the essence, Hill said. In the next five to 10 years, she says scientists ""absolutely have to come up with new technologies that are replacements for those earlier conventional strategies"" and that work in concert with each other.

With climate change and a growing human population, ""I think we are going to see more epidemics"" of mosquito-borne illness, Hill said. ""And we will see those diseases in places where we haven't seen it before.""

""It is a constant arms race between us and the mosquito and the pathogens it transmits,"" she added. ""I don't think it's ever going to go away, and I don't see one magic bullet."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140610121302-restricted-10-animal-attacks-0610-story-top.jpg
45f4ccdf6815442bbe6fb5e26f1cda60	['Jen Christensen', 'Dan Simon']	2018-09-25 00:00:00	A California girl can attend school with her cannabis-based medicine, court rules	https://www.cnn.com/	US	A California girl can attend school with her cannabis-based medicine, court rules	1	"(CNN) It took a fight in court, but a 5-year-old girl will be allowed to bring her cannabis-based medicine to school and attend class with other students, according to a ruling by a California administrative court on Friday.

Brooke Adams, a Santa Rosa, California, kindergartner, has Dravet Syndrome . It's a severe and rare form of epilepsy that comes with life-threatening seizures that are unpredictable, frequent and can cause serious damage if not treated quickly. What can help control the seizures, if she gets the medicine fast enough, is cannabis oil. She uses CBD oil as a preventative medication and THC oil as an emergency seizure medication.

The Rincon Valley Union School District previously covered the cost of a private preschool, and a licensed vocational nurse who followed the child on the bus and went with her to class. The nurse stood by, ready with the rescue medication, in case Brooke's had a seizure. But when Brooke's parents met with the district in April to make a plan for kindergarten in a public school, the district declined to place Brooke in a school and refused her access to a school bus. The reason, the district said, was that it had legal concerns about having the cannabis oil on public school property, according to the court documents.

""The assistant superintendent Cathy Myhers had said she would like to have Brooke on campus,"" said the lawyer for the district Jennifer Nix, but it wasn't clear that it was legal.

Instead, Rincon Valley offered one hour of home instruction a day and continued services of the nurse at home, rather than at school. Brooke's parents wanted her to go to school. Her experience at preschool, interacting with other children and attending class, has helped her grow socially and academically, her family and medical professionals testified.

The parents took the school district to court.

The school district argued that while Brooke made social and intellectual progress attending a preschool, federal and state law prohibited students from having medical cannabis on school grounds. The medicine has been a life saver, according to Brooke's family and her doctor, who testified in court that Brooke cannot function without it.

If treated quickly, Brooke's seizures may not have an immediate side effect, according to her physician, Dr. Joseph Sullivan , the director of the Pediatric Epilepsy Center at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco. The ""cumulative effect of hundreds of seizures over time results in developmental stagnation and intellectual disability,"" according to Sullivan's testimony. Brooke was having 20 seizures a month when she first saw him for treatment.

Dravet Syndrome has left Brooke with speech and language delays, behavioral and developmental delays and problems with movement and balance. The disease has to be treated daily, but it is ""highly resistant to currently available medications.""

In Brooke's case, the family tried a number of traditional pharmaceuticals on the market such as Onfi Depakote and Keppra. None seemed to stop the seizures, according to Sullivan, but cannabis oil seemed to work. The medicine has reduced the number of Brooke's seizures and her family said her longest seizure-free period came since she has been using cannabis based medicine. ""It was stopping every seizure, which was miracle for us,"" Jana Adams said.

Myhers, the Rincon Valley assistant superintendent for student services who oversees the district's special education program, testified that a school campus would be the best place to meet Brooke's educational and social development goals, were it not for the illegality of having the medicine on campus. She testified that there was concern that if Brooke did come to campus with the medicine, it ""could potentially jeopardize"" funding for the district, since the district is supposed to provide a declaration that it is a drug and alcohol-free campus.

The court determined that the nurse and the child were well within the parameters of California's Compassionate Use Act and the 2003 Medical Marijuana Program Act and interpreted those laws to say that qualified patients and their caregivers can have the medicine with them on the bus and on school grounds ""if [they] followed the same procedures on a public school campus that she did in the preschool.""

""I was definitely relieved and excited and emotional,"" Jana Adams said. The cannabis, she said, ""It's life, life saving, life changing.""

She said the drug has made a huge difference in the lives of their entire family. ""I've had to stay home with Brooke from vacations and different things and now we can go places as a family, you know, it's, it's totally different,"" Adams said. ""I know that I have confidence that the THC is going to stop the seizure ... I had no idea what the outcome was going to be once she started having a seizure. ""

""We are glad to have clarity and we are glad to serve Brooke,"" said Jennifer Nix the lawyer who represented the school district in this case. ""We appreciated that the judge addressed each of our concerns.""

The California legislature has tried to clear up potential confusion about the state's compassionate use law when schools are involved. This year, the legislature passed Senate Bill 1127 , which awaits a signature from Gov. Jerry Brown and would allow school districts to create policies permitting parents or a guardian of a qualified student to possess and use medical cannabis at school. Since 2014, Congress has prohibited the US Department of Justice to spend money on prosecuting cannabis-related activities if those activities are allowed under state medical marijuana laws, although the Trump administration has signaled it might change this approach.

Brooke is not the first child to bump into a school district concerned about the legality of the medicine. In a groundbreaking case in April, an Illinois judge ruled in favor of letting 11-year-old Ashley Surin. who has childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia , attend class with her cannabis-based medicines. In that case, the Illinois attorney general had to agree that there would be no negative legal ramifications for staff who would help Surin with her medicine. A federal judge also had to issue an emergency order to allow her back to school, because Illinois law does not spell out an exception for medical use in a school setting.

Colorado, Maine, New Jersey and Washington state do allow some students to use medical marijuana at school. As medicinal cannabis becomes more accepted by the American public and medical communities, experts say states are going to have to address it.

Joe Rogoway , the Adams' attorney. hopes that this ruling can become a kind of legal blueprint for schools. ""A lot of parents will just give up if they were told you can't take the child to school,"" Rogoway said. He added his staff was ""a little teary eyed"" when they got the decision.

""I'm hopeful that people won't have to fight this and school districts will do the right thing and allow children to go to school regardless of the medication they are taking,"" Rogoway said.

""I never imagined that I would be the one to be fighting for this and having to go through it, but I definitely would do it over again,"" Jana Adams said. While cases like these are typically private she thought it was important to tell her family's story. ""We decided to make it public so that we could help others see the benefits and know that, you know, with the ruling, I think it'll help other school districts know that there shouldn't be an excuse."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180924095928-02-brooke-adams-file-super-tease.jpg
f69eaa09b9ca4d3db9ac79bc7cbed028	['Michael Nedelman']	2018-09-24 00:00:00	Breastfeeding better for babies' weight, BMI than pumping, study says	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Breastfeeding better for babies' weight, BMI than pumping, study says	1	"(CNN) Research has already shown a link between breastfeeding and lower obesity risk for babies. But a new study finds another association: ""Breast is best"" for them even compared with giving babies breast milk out of the bottle.

The benefits of direct breastfeeding included slower weight gain and lower BMI scores at 3 months, according to a Canadian study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics.

Still, even pumped breast milk was superior to none at all, in line with past research.

""Moms who pump go through a lot of effort to do that, and I wouldn't want them to get the impression that it's not worth it. But it does raise the question of, if pumped milk is not the same or not as good, why is that? And what should we be doing to support moms better around breastfeeding if that's what they want to do?"" said study author Meghan Azad, research scientist at the Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba.

Of more than 2,500 infants from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development study, those with the lowest BMI scores at 12 months were those who were breastfed -- without formula -- and who started eating other foods around 5 to 6 months. (The researchers did not distinguish how infants were fed breast milk past the 3-month outcomes.)

Researchers say this could impact children's risk of becoming overweight or developing obesity down the line. The new study found that stopping breastfeeding before 6 months was linked to faster weight gain, a higher body mass index at 12 months and three times the risk of being overweight compared with exclusive breastfeeding.

""Other data has shown quite nicely that if you have an elevated (BMI) early on in life, it sets you up for childhood and then adolescent obesity later on in life,"" said Lars Bode, director of the Larsson-Rosenquist Foundation Mother-Milk-Infant Center of Research Excellence at the University of California San Diego.

The mechanism behind why breastfeeding could be superior to pumping is yet unclear, if indeed a causal link to BMI is ultimately found, Bode noted. Perhaps something happens to breast milk components when it is refrigerated, frozen or thawed. Perhaps the act of suckling allows babies to better control the amount they're consuming. (Study data did not test breast milk nor measure the amount consumed.)

Nevertheless, researchers say the study reinforces benefits of breast milk, and they're sending a message to policymakers about parental leave and support for breastfeeding.

In the United States, ""many moms, they have to go back to work after a few weeks, so if they want to continue providing breast milk, they have to do it by pumping,"" said Azad.

""The United States is a member of an exclusive group of 3 nations that offer no paid maternity leave,"" Dr. Alison Volpe Holmes, associate professor of pediatrics at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, wrote in an editorial published in the same journal.

""This, coupled with US opposition to measures supporting breastfeeding at the 2018 World Health Assembly, does not bode well for US mothers and infants trying to derive the full health benefits of exclusive breastfeeding.""

'Every feed counts'

Azad's study found that the more you breastfeed, the stronger the link to these benefits -- even if some formula is involved. She said there's a positive message for moms, not all of whom may be able to exclusively breastfeed: It's not all-or-nothing.

""Any amount is better than none. The more you can do, the better,"" Azad said. ""Every feed counts.""

In the study, just 18% of infants were exclusively breastfed by the 6-month mark, and 55% of those who were only fed breast milk received at least some in a bottle.

The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding ""up to 6 months of age, with continued breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods up to two years of age or beyond.""

There are plenty of other good reasons to breastfeed when possible, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: a lower risk of some infections, Type 2 diabetes and asthma, to name a few.

Breastfeeding ""still is so much more powerful than formula-feeding,"" regardless of how it's fed, Bode said. ""I think that message very often gets overlooked.""

Azad said that pumping might not be a choice for all moms, and that the way forward isn't by putting all the pressure on moms to breastfeed.

""Putting all the onus on individual mothers is not how we're going to make progress,"" she said. ""It's making this a bigger society issue. It's about providing support, whether that's at the family or community or policy level."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150318110104-02-breastfeeding-031815-super-169.jpg
ab46d0c368cb4a4d8c8f1425bd80a5a5	['Sandee Lamotte']	2018-09-24 00:00:00	Varicose veins may be genetically more likely in taller people	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Varicose veins may be genetically more likely in taller people	1	"(CNN) In what researchers are calling ""the largest genetic study ever performed"" on varicose vein disease, a Stanford University School of Medicine study found a person's height to be a significant risk factor for developing varicose veins.

""We not only found an association between height and varicose veins, but the genetic studies we did showed a causal link,"" said cardiologist and study author Dr. Nicholas Leeper, an associate professor of surgery and cardiovascular medicine at Stanford. ""That suggests that the genes and pathways that drive human height are also likely to be causing varicose veins.""

Dr. Cheryl Hoffman, medical director for the UCLA Health-Manhattan Beach Interventional and Imaging Center, singled out ""the strong genetic link.""

""We know that varicose veins and venous disease are genetic, so it makes sense there might be something wrong with the vein walls that runs in families,"" said Hoffman, who was not involved in the research.

What are varicose veins?

Swollen, twisty purple veins that often look like tree branches just under the surface of the skin, varicose veins can cause aching pain, throbbing and discomfort.

""A lack of movement, being pregnant, overweight, all this puts pressure on the veins in the lower part of the body, and some blood begins to pool instead of traveling up the veins back to the heart,"" Hoffman explained. ""Varicose veins are an extension of that.""

Varicose veins in a woman's legs.

Typically found in the legs, the unsightly protrusions are usually benign but can lead to more serious heath issues , such as bleeding, sores or ulcers and blood clots.

The most serious complication is deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, a blood clot in one or more of the deeper veins. Deep vein thrombosis is typically characterized by cramping pain, redness and swelling at the site, although it can occur with no symptoms. DVT needs immediate treatment; if one of the clots breaks loose, it can travel through the bloodstream and cause a life-threatening pulmonary embolism, or blocked blood flow in the lungs.

About 20% of all adults will develop varicose veins, according to the US National Library of Medicine. The Society for Vascular Surgery estimates that up to 35% of Americans have the condition, which most commonly affects women, especially those with multiple children, and the obese.

A theory proved

Using data from the UK Biobank, a genetic repository of 502,619 people ages 40 to 69, the Stanford researchers identified 30 genetic regions associated with varicose veins. Then they used an artificial intelligence machine model to look for any previously unknown risk factors.

JUST WATCHED Yoga you can do on a plane Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Yoga you can do on a plane 02:08

Out of 2,716 predictors of varicose veins, the machine model confirmed many currently established risk factors: age, family history, gender, weight, pregnancy, smoking, hormone therapy and a history of deep vein thrombosis or surgery on the legs.

But, Leeper said, the connection to height was surprising.

To verify that finding, researchers used a statistical technique known as Mendelian randomization to see whether height was an actual cause. Sure enough, the analysis showed that it was.

""A handful of studies from 20 or 30 years ago hinted at a link,"" Leeper said. ""We don't understand it. Perhaps taller people are affected by gravity, or there could be something in the vessel wall itself. What is happening, we just don't know.""

Treatment for varicose veins is limited to surgical interventions, such as vein catheterization or laser treatment, along with lifestyle changes such as compression stockings. Standing all day or sitting for long periods of time, such as on a plane, should also be avoided, as it can increase blood pressure inside of veins.

9564c47d73b8425d8995980009074a23	['Susan Scutti']	2018-09-20 00:00:00	Globally, losing the fight against cancer and other chronic diseases	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Globally, losing the fight against cancer and other chronic diseases	1	"(CNN) More than half of all UN countries will fail to honor their commitment to reduce premature deaths from cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and diabetes by 2030, a new analysis predicts.

The Sustainable Development Goals signed by all 193 member states of the United Nations in 2015 are a blueprint for achieving global well-being and are divided into 17 aims, including ""no poverty,"" ""zero hunger"" and ""quality education"" in addition to ""good health and well-being.""

""They are aspirations, or commitments, agreed upon by the global community to have better, healthier, more positive lives for everyone, today and in the future,"" Professor Majid Ezzati, senior author of the new report and chair of global environmental health at Imperial College London, wrote in an email. Combined, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals ""cover all aspects of human, societal and planetary health and wellbeing,"" he said.

The report, which examined progress toward just one of several health targets, forecasts defeat for most countries. Published Thursday in the medical journal The Lancet, it is the result of a collaboration led by The Lancet, the World Health Organization, Imperial College London and the Non-Communicable Disease Alliance, a nongovernmental organization based in Switzerland.

Responsible for 7 of 10 deaths worldwide

Specifically, the report estimated whether individual countries will achieve the goal of a one-third cut in the probability that a person will die prematurely from cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes by 2030. Early death is commonly defined as before age 70. The researchers based their estimates on comparisons of changes in death rates from 2010 through 2016 for 186 countries.

Few nations will do so: Only 35 will achieve the goal of reducing premature deaths for women and just 30 will do so for men by 2030, the researchers predict.

South Korea, Singapore, Luxembourg, Norway, New Zealand, Costa Rica, Denmark, Estonia, the Czech Republic, the Maldives, Thailand, Croatia, Slovakia, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Qatar, Iran, Latvia, Belarus, Serbia, Kuwait, Samoa, Armenia, Macedonia, Oman, Azerbaijan, Russia, Ukraine, Zambia, the Republic of the Congo, Grenada, Timor-Leste, Moldova and Kazakhstan are the countries likely to achieve the goal for women, the report indicates.

Iceland, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, Bahrain, Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, Singapore, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Belgium, Iran, the Maldives, Argentina, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Timor-Leste, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Estonia, Macedonia, Latvia, Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan are likely to achieve the goal for men.

However, all hope is not lost for the remaining nations: Fifty will probably achieve the same reduction goal for women and 35 for men in a delayed timeframe -- by 2040 -- according to the study authors.

All told, noncommunicable diseases account for 7 of every 10 deaths worldwide, Ezzati said, noting that this ""largest cause of premature death in the world is not being sufficiently addressed relative to the amount of ill health that it causes, especially for the worst off.""

Within this category of death, an estimated 80% are due to the four diseases highlighted in the report -- cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes -- while the remaining 20% are due to other types of noncommunicable disease.

In addition to the four diseases highlighted in the report, noncommunicable diseases include endocrine, blood and immune disorders; noninfectious respiratory, digestive (including liver) and genitourinary diseases; neurological conditions; mental and substance-use disorders; congenital anomalies; and sense organ, skin, musculoskeletal and oral or dental conditions.

Constructive criticism

In a commentary published with the report, the editors of The Lancet wrote, ""Accountability is partly about naming and shaming. But, more importantly, accountability is about identifying the specific measures countries must take to improve the likelihood of meeting their stated commitments.""

Ezzati said he and his co-authors did not plan to ""name and shame."" Instead, their report informs their target audience how a major determinant of health is changing over time while providing directions for achieving better health.

""Our target audience is not simply national governments but also aid agencies and donors who are substantially underinvesting in non-communicable diseases relative to the amount of ill health that they cause,"" Ezzati said.

Last year, a report published in a related journal, The Lancet Global Health, estimated the cost of achieving Sustainable Development Goal health targets in 67 low- and middle-income countries in which three-quarters of the world's population resides.

An additional $371 billion would be needed per year through 2030 to reach the targets, according to the study authors. This money would be spent on adding more than 23.6 million health workers, including 3 million doctors, and building more than 415,000 health facilities.

The 2018 UN High-Level Meeting on noncommunicable diseases is scheduled for September 27 and is the occasion on which the new report has been published, The Lancet editors explained in their commentary: ""The promises made by the international community must be delivered."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160506162204-planet-earth-olympics-quiz-super-tease.jpg

More than 75% of these deaths were among men, says the report, published Friday.

The largest cause of death -- 28% -- was due to injuries. This was followed by 21% of deaths due to digestive disorders and 19% due to cardiovascular diseases. The remaining causes of death were infectious diseases, cancers, mental disorders and other health conditions attributable to drinking alcohol.

""The alcohol consumption level continues to be very high,"" said Dr. Vladimir Poznyak, WHO's Management of Substance Abuse coordinator. ""All countries can do much more to reduce the health and social costs of the harmful use of alcohol.""

Alcohol consumption was also found to cause more than 5% of the global disease burden and reported to be a causal factor in over 200 disease and injury conditions.

By 2060, those numbers are expected to rise to 13.9 million people (3.3% of Americans)

(CNN) As the aging population of the United States grows, a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that from 2014 to 2060, there will be a 178% increase in the number of Americans who have Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

That means the US burden is expected to more than double, from 1.6% of the population (5 million people) in 2014 to nearly 3.3% (13.9 million people) in 2060.

The study, published Wednesday in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, was the first to look at race and ethnicity in relation to dementia and its future.

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are ""characterized by a decline in memory leading to loss of independence,"" the authors write. Symptoms can include memory loss, decline in skills such as word finding and reduced reasoning or judgment, according to the National Institute on Aging. Treatments include ""helping people maintain mental function, manage behavioral symptoms, and slow down certain problems, such as memory loss."" It's the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.

""Although the primary risk factor for ADRD [Alzheimer's disease and related dementias] is age, race and ethnicity is also an important demographic risk factor,"" the study notes. ""Estimates of ADRD among these subgroups do not exist.""

But reforms to Malawi's 157-year-old laws are stuck	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Women are dying from backstreet abortions. But reforms to Malawi's 157-year-old laws are stuck	1	"CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equals , a year-long series.

Blantyre, Malawi — David Minyatso holds the voter registration card of his late wife, Selina.

The last time he saw her, she had just found out she was pregnant with their fourth child.

""She told me she was feeling symptoms of pregnancy. She left for her home village two days later to visit her parents,"" 36-year-old Minyatso said, standing in the doorway of their thatched-roof home in Kaseleka village, his daughters playing in the dirt yard outside.

""I was later told that she went to a traditional healer to seek abortion-induced drugs which killed her.""

Selina Black is among hundreds of women who die every year in Malawi as a result of the government's restrictive abortion law, which only permits the procedure in cases where the woman's life is at risk. Obtaining an abortion for any other reason is punishable by seven to 14 years in prison; while people supplying drugs or instruments to procure abortion can face three years in jail.

In Malawi, home to one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, unsafe abortion is estimated to account for 6%-18% of all maternal deaths, according to research conducted by Guttmacher Institute , a US-based reproductive rights think tank, and the Centre for Reproductive Health at the University of Malawi College of Medicine.

But a draft ""Termination of Pregnancy"" bill is seeking to loosen the country's 157-year-old law. If approved, the bill would allow an abortion when the pregnancy threatens the physical or mental health of the woman, fetal abnormalities affect the life of the baby, or in cases of rape, incest and defilement.

The bill, which is currently being scrutinized by Cabinet ministers before it moves to Parliament for debate, has faced strong resistance from influential religious bodies in the country. About 81% of Malawi's population is Christian, according to a 2014 national survey

In the three years that have passed since the draft bill was first introduced thousands more women have resorted to risky clandestine abortions -- 141,000 in 2015 alone, according to the Guttmacher report.

Minyatso says he was devastated when he heard that Selina was dead. The couple were still contemplating whether they would keep the baby, and he believes Selina's decision to go ahead with the abortion was influenced by other family members.

""I don't have any plan to marry again,"" Minyatso, who struggles to work as a farmer and tend to his young family, said. ""I will never find a woman who will take care of the children as Selina did.""

Chrispine Sibande, a human rights lawyer and former coordinator for the Coalition for Prevention of Unsafe Abortion (an abortion rights body comprising 45 health rights organizations lobbying for liberalized laws), says the draft abortion bill would allow women like Selina Black to access legal abortion safely.

""The 1861 law, under section 243 of the penal code, says abortion can only be performed by a skilled person through operation. Now you and me would ask 'who is this skilled person'? So the new law clarifies that,"" he said, underlining that while the current law allows abortion to save the life of the mother, the language is unclear.

In the absence of legal routes, many women seeking abortion in Malawi, like Selina Black, turn to traditional healers.

A traditional healer shows some of the abortion-inducing concoctions.

A healer, who asked not to be identified for fear of being arrested, said he has been providing abortion services to women since he started his trade a decade ago.

""I assist these women because they are currently desperate,"" he said, adding that doing so is against the constitution of the International Traditional Medicine Council of Malawi, a group of accredited traditional healers of which he is member.

He gives the women a concoction of what he calls ""abortion-inducing"" herbs.

""But still I advise my clients to immediately seek medical help if they notice any serious complications,"" he explains.

Chisale Mhango an obstetrician at Malawi's largest referral health facility, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, says he receives between 20 and 30 patients with post-abortion complications every day.

""The complications include injury to reproductive health organs because some of them use sticks to poke [the fetus] so that they can cause an abortion. And through that, they get infection which is a serious problem that would lead to things like surgery that may require removing the womb. And there is hemorrhage,"" he said.

Mhango says the post abortion care is also costly for the national health system.

""In 2015, the studies suggested that we were spending more than $2 million just to manage complications of unsafe abortion and yet the Ministry of Health budget is not increasing,"" he said. One recent report estimated that the Malawi government spends closer to $1 million annually on post-abortion care.

Margret Kawala, the head of Kawala village, about an hour drive from the capital Lilongwe, says she lost her uterus after taking a concoction given to her by a traditional healer for an abortion.

""I was rushed to the hospital,"" Kawala, a 46-year-old single mother of of three, said. ""There, the doctors said I was losing a lot of blood because my uterus had burst and they had to remove it.""

A year after she lost her uterus, her husband left her.

""He said he wanted a wife who could give him another child. He left for good, and now, he has married another woman,"" Kawala said.

Though she struggles to feed her three children, and wishes she had the help of a partner, Kawala says she still feels lucky. Many other women in her area have died as a result of unsafe abortions.

""I have nothing to hide. That's why I speak openly about my situation. I want government authorities to know the gravity of harm that restrictive abortion laws have caused to women,"" Kawala said.

Still, parliamentarians are noncommittal about their position on the draft bill, and refer to their religion when discussing its merits.

Aisha Mambo of Mangochi-Nkungulu Constituency said she wouldn't comment until she had scrutinized the final bill: ""And I will base my position on what my religion says about abortion because I can't act against the teachings of my religion.""

Back in Malawi's largest referral health facility, Mhango says the issue has nothing to do with religion.

""The debate is not about whether abortion is good or not,"" Mhango said, adding that the law needs to change if it can't be properly enforced.

""The debate is women are dying in increasing numbers in spite of the fact that there is a law in this country specifically to prevent women dying from unsafe abortion when their lives are in danger."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180924132037-01-as-equals-malawi-restrictive-abortion-super-tease.jpg

Each step is exhilarating and exhausting. She pauses amid the 90-degree Florida heat and smiles.

""It only takes a little bit of try -- and by a little, I mean a lot,"" she says.

Thomas, 24, is one of three paralyzed patients who can now walk again, thanks to a stimulation device implanted in her lower back coupled with intense physical therapy. News of the patients' progress -- considered an important medical advancement -- was published in separate studies in two scientific journals on Monday.

On a recent sunny day, Thomas returned to the spot that took so much from her on July 19, 2014. It's where the truck she was driving came to a halt after flipping four times around a bend on Halls River Road and smashing into a tree. Her body was motionless, hanging halfway out of the mangled wreckage. She was blue and getting cold.

She has driven past the scene of the crash many times since then to try to jar her memory. To help remember what happened that night. To piece together the moment that changed everything. Nothing seems to work.

The scene of the accident that left Kelly Thomas paralyzed.

Visiting this time, she walks toward the tree, talking to her legs to motivate them to keep moving. ""One foot in front of the other,"" she says. ""Slowly but surely.""

At 5 feet, 1 inch tall, she is a spitfire of inspiration. Her grit shows immediately, not just from when she walks, but also when she talks.

""Paralysis isn't in my dictionary.""

""Don't call me handicapped, because I'm not.""

""Thank God, I was raised cowboy tough.""

It takes several minutes for her to walk the 40 feet from her car to the tree. Every step is worth it: Today is about triumph rather than a search for lost memories.

""I tell you what,"" she says. ""It does feel good to be standing where I thought my life ended.""

She woke in a hospital a couple of weeks after the accident, with tubes and wires seemingly hooked up to everything. At 19, she was paralyzed from the chest down.

Thomas stands next to the red maple where the truck she was driving came to a halt. ""The stimulator is facilitating my movement,"" she says, ""but my strength is coming from within.""

She told her neurosurgeon she would walk again, no matter how slim the odds. He left the room and told her mother not to ""go chasing something that's never going to happen.""

The journey has been in no way easy.

There were tears and screaming fits. In moments of desperation, she would say to God, ""I don't know why this has happened, but if you can help me to understand this, it might make it a little easier.""

She had planned to become a physical therapist to help others. Her mission changed that fateful July day. She's now helping others by taking steps and speaking up.

The trunk of the red maple still bears scars from the crash, with chunks of bark missing from when truck and tree met.

As she stands next to the tree, Thomas searches for the words to describe her emotions. ""It's somewhere between 'I told you so' and the impossible,"" she says. ""Somewhere between possible and impossible.

""Being here gives me a sense of power, because I lost a life here. But I also gained a brand new one. And I'm proud of the new life I have.""

Transforming the spinal cord injury field

Thomas is part of innovative research conducted at the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center at the University of Louisville.

In a study published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine, two of four patients with ""motor complete spinal cord injury"" -- meaning no voluntary movement below their injury -- were able to walk again after being implanted with a spinal cord stimulation device and then undergoing extensive physical therapy. They walk with the aid of walkers.

Thomas became paralyzed at the age of 19. Always active in life, she made a pledge to herself that she'd walk again, no matter the odds.

""This should change our thinking about people with paralysis,"" said Susan Harkema, one of the lead researchers on the project and a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Louisville. ""It's phenomenal. This new knowledge is giving us the tools to develop new strategies and tools for recovery in people with chronic spinal injuries.""

Claudia Angeli, the other lead researcher and a senior researcher at the Human Locomotion Research Center at Frazier Rehab Institute in Louisville, said it's a fascinating time to be involved in spinal cord research, bringing together decades of investigations culminating in modern-day breakthroughs.

""It just shows the capacity of the spinal cord and how much we're learning about using the epidural stimulation in combination with therapy,"" Angeli said.

14 paralyzed people who have received what is called an epidural stimulator implanted over a portion of the lower spinal cord, enabling neurons below their injuries to receive signals the brain used to send before their accidents. Over the years , their research has involved14 paralyzed people who have received what is called an epidural stimulator implanted over a portion of the lower spinal cord, enabling neurons below their injuries to receive signals the brain used to send before their accidents.

All 14 patients have experienced voluntarily movement with the implant, the researchers said. They also showed improvement in bowel and bladder function.

The latest study focused on four patients, including Thomas who underwent therapy twice a day for five days a week for many months. A morning therapy session would involve working on stepping; an afternoon session would focus on standing. Thomas's therapy lasted 10 months after receiving the implant.

Thomas says she has to focus on every step to walk. Sometimes, she talks to her feet to keep them moving.

All four were able to stand independently, and two were able to walk over ground, the researchers said. One patient fractured his hip, setting his therapy back by several months, the researchers said.

The other patient who was able to walk over ground had been paralyzed from his neck down with no ability to move his arms until he received the stimulator. ""With the stimulator off,"" Angeli said, ""he can't even sit up.""

Harkema and Angeli said they believe the positive results were the combination of the stimulation and improved physical therapy treatment.

Harkema underwent a federal investigation a couple years ago. Certain research activities were determined to be in violation of federal regulations, according to a letter from the Department of Health and Human Services in 2016. The letter states the University of Louisville took adequate corrective actions to address the noncompliance. Harkema says she stands by her work.

What's it like to see people who are paralyzed walk again?

""I draw inspiration from every person with a spinal cord injury who comes into this program,"" Harkema said. ""They each have their own unique personalities and spirits. They are just pioneers.""

Adding to the excitement of these advancements, another study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine unveiled similar results. A man paralyzed since 2013 regained his ability to stand and walk with assistance due to spinal cord stimulation and physical therapy, according to research done in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, Los Angeles.

Thomas uses a walker with front wheels. She says her top goal now is ditch the walker one day.

""What this is teaching us is that those networks of neurons below a spinal cord injury still can function after paralysis,"" Dr. Kendall Lee, the co-principal investigator and director of Mayo Clinic's Neural Engineering Laboratories, said in a press release.

There have been other cases in recent years in which paralyzed people have risen from their wheelchairs and walked. One study in 2015 and another in 2016 showed success in using rehabilitation combined with what is called ""brain-computer interface,"" in which brain signals were sent to an electrical stimulator or exoskeleton resulting in the generation of muscle activity, allowing some patients to walk.

""They're different in terms of the way to activate the central nervous system, but the overall outcome is similar,"" said Monica Perez, a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery with the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami.

Monday's studies, Perez said, provide important additional evidence to the continued advances being made in the spinal cord injury field. She said it shows more proof that people with severe paralysis often have residual connections that ""can be engaged in a functionally relevant manner -- and that's amazing.""

""What the studies demonstrate is that those connections in the central nervous system can still be recruited, even though you have an injury from years ago,"" said Perez, who was not connected to either study.

From a scientific point of view, she said, an important consequence of the studies is the awareness ""that we need to work harder to understand how we can better involve those connections,"" she said. ""These people with more severe paralysis are regaining this level of function -- and that is beautiful. We also need more accurate assessments of our patients.""

""It's not the first time an individual with severe clinically complete paralysis has walked with assistive technology without the help of a therapist,"" she said. ""But it's tremendously important that in more cases the potential of these approaches can be demonstrated.""

Harkema and Angeli, whose study was funded in part by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, said it's imperative for stakeholders to come together to fund more research to help as many of the 1.2 million people with paralysis. More than 8,000 have expressed interest in being research participants in their program.

For Thomas, it's even more personal. She wants others with injuries as severe as hers to experience the transformation she's gone through.

""Nothing's going to be able to stop me in life, because I took something that was thought to be impossible, and I turned it into possible,"" she says.

'Way too many things to do'

Since she was a child, Thomas has loved to ride horses. She'd saddle up her horse Shadow and take off across the family's ranch. At rodeos, she and Shadow were inseparable.

""All you need is love and a horse,"" the motto next to her bed says.

In her late teens, she would run 3 to 4 miles a day, train horses and do endurance weight training at the gym almost every day. She worked as a waitress while attending college to become a physical therapist.

All of that was shattered in an instant. The young woman who had been so active was now confined to a chair at the age of 19. It was a fate she could not accept.

Thomas still rides her horse Shadow, but she needs assistance getting on. Her goal is to be able to saddle Shadow herself and hop on with no help.

Not only had she lost her ability to walk, she'd lost bladder control and sexual function. If she went outside, her body temperature would skyrocket over 101 degrees because it could no longer regulate itself. Every bit of her independence, she felt, had been stripped.

""I was lying there saying, 'there is no way I can sit in this chair the rest of my life,' "" she says. ""I have way too many things to do.""

To walk again, she'd have to ""cowboy up,"" as she puts it. She'd rely on the toughness instilled in her by her father from working on the ranch.

It would push her to the limits, at times leaving her on the floor crying, wanting to quit. She'd heard about the program in Louisville. She first went for a screening in January 2017. She returned a month later and stayed through May to do physical therapy, working on standing and stepping for an hour every day.

The stimulator would require a major surgery and a commitment to stay in Louisville for at least a year. She wrestled with the decision. She talked with several men who had the stimulator. They had made gains after the implant, but at the time, no one had walked. She thought, ""what's the point of going through so much work?""

""Just being able to stand or wiggle my toes,"" she says, ""was not enough for me.""

Thomas's room is decked out with horse mementos from her days at the rodeo.

One of her sisters spoke with her. She told Thomas that she didn't want her to wonder ""what if"" for the rest of her life. No one knew what Thomas' decision would be.

On August 5, 2017, the family's vehicle was loaded up. ""Are we going?"" her father asked.

They drove the 13 hours to Louisville. The stimulator was implanted the next month.

Sensation swept through her body as soon as it was turned on.""There was this rushing vibration,"" she says. ""It was like a highlighter of my muscles. All of them were contracting. It was wild.""

The real work lay in the months ahead. She had endured physical therapy sessions three times a week for three years prior to the implant. That helped set her on a path for success, she says, but it was nothing close to how hard the work over the next year would be. She attended physical therapy fives times a week, a couple of hours every day.

She clung to her faith during the most agonizing sessions, repeating phrases to herself: ""I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me"" and ""God is with me. I will not fail.""

""I tell you what: After the implant, I was introduced to a whole new ballgame,"" she says. ""The hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. I prayed my way through so many sessions, just to get me through, because I wanted to quit.""

Thomas says growing up on her family's ranch made her tough and prepared her for the journey.

The stimulator does not move her legs for her. It stimulates neurons and nerves, allowing her to consciously control the movement.

It began small -- wiggling of toes -- then one leg being able to move and then figuring out how to sync her legs to be able to walk.

She was wearing a black T-shirt with the phrase ""No Days Off"" on that magical day in February. She took a step or two, and then her therapist broke out in dance. The two hugged and cried. ""Oh, my God,"" Thomas said.

She wiped away the tears and took more steps.

It was like trying to pat your tummy and rub your head at the same time, she says explaining how it felt trying to coordinate her legs, body and mind.

""Trying to trust my body, trying to find a cadence, was very hard.""

Finding her calling

Thomas can now walk and talk at the same time, but she still must focus on each step.

She presses a device against her abdomen to turn the stimulator on. ""I'm still paralyzed as can be without it,"" she says.

To turn her stimulator on, Kelly uses a magnet hooked up to this device and presses it against her abdomen.

When she stands, she asks herself, ""How do I walk, again?""

Beyond helping her walk, the stimulator has restored sexual function and much of her bladder control. She has regained muscle mass, and nerve pain in her right foot has disappeared. ""I'm totally pro stimulator. I love it,"" she says.

Strolling across her front lawn at the family ranch, she says that her No. 1 goal in the short term is to get rid of her walker. She'd love to be able to run again.

She points to the nearby barn that houses Shadow. She longs to be able to walk to the barn by herself, saddle her up and get on. She'd longs to get Shadow in a full gallop again.

""That's the day I'll accept that I'm healed,"" she says.

For now, she's taking every day one stride at a time. She says her story is not about herself; it's about helping others. She's buoyed by messages of support from friends and strangers alike. She says it's for them that she works so hard.

In town, that encouragement is on full display.

""I just want to tell you congratulations, sweetie. You're doing beautiful,"" a woman tells her outside the Homosassa Public Library.

A man in a pickup sees her struggling at her car. ""Need some help?"" he asks.

""No, sir,"" she responds. ""I've got it.""

Thomas stands at the spot where she was left paralyzed in 2014. She said it was empowering to be able to walk and stand at the scene.

She exemplifies a fierce determination like few others. Through her struggle, she's found her calling. Being around her, one can't help but be inspired. She rattles off an array of powerful messages.

""Even if I can't physically help people like I initially intended to do, I can dang sure encourage, help and motivate.""

""I carry on with my life like nobody's business, even if my legs aren't working so great.""

""The stimulator is facilitating my movement, but my strength is coming from within.""

That strength is what's gotten her this far. Her 19-year-old brother, Sam, sums it up in cowboy speak: ""There's nothing she can't do. That's for sure.""

He lifts his sister onto Shadow. Kelly and Shadow trot around the font yard. She doesn't know when, but she says one day, she'll hop on without her brother's help.

""I don't have a time frame,"" she says, ""but I have physical goals to get me there.""

The moral of her story, she says, is never underestimate a cowboy."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180921152954-kelly-thomas-01-super-tease.jpg

pregnant women who have untreated syphilis will pass it on to the fetus in utero Stillbirth, death of a newborn or infection are all possible outcomes for congenital syphilis

(CNN) Congenital syphilis cases -- when a mother passes syphilis onto her baby during pregnancy or delivery -- have more than doubled in the United States since 2013, according to an report released Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Eight out of 10 pregnant women who have untreated syphilis will pass it onto their babies through the placenta and this can lead to stillbirth or death of a newborn in up to 40% of affected pregnancies, according to the CDC.

The number of recorded cases swelled from 362 in 2013 to 918 in 2017, the report indicates. Five states -- Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas -- account for 70% of the cases, according to the CDC. Additional cases were reported in 32 states, primarily Western and Southern states. The overall increase in congenital syphilis outpaces the national increase in sexually transmitted disease overall, the report indicated.

Diagnoses of primary and secondary syphilis, the most infectious stages of the disease, increased 76% in the US from 2013 to 2017, the CDC reports. Though rates of syphilis accelerated most among men, who accounted for more than 88% of infections in 2017, rates among women are also rising. The new report found 2.3 cases per 100,000 women in 2017, which rose from 1.9 cases diagnosed for every 100,000 women in 2016.

One in three women who gave birth to a baby with syphilis in 2016 did get tested during pregnancy, but either acquired syphilis after that test or did not get treated in time to cure the infection in the unborn baby, according to the CDC.

380841c185dd4de28273ab1fff26eab0	['Kat Arney']	2018-09-25 00:00:00	The DNA detectives who are hunting the causes of cancer	https://www.cnn.com/	US	The DNA detectives who are hunting the causes of cancer	1	"(CNN) Halfway up a hill overlooking the Great Rift Valley in western Kenya are two graves. One of them is a few years old now, bristling with bushy shrubs stretching bright green leaves towards a cloudless sky. The other is a freshly dug bed of rough red dirt planted with a white wooden cross. They are the final resting places of Emily's mother and father, who died within four years of each other.

Still a young woman, Emily now looks after her family's rural homestead near Iten -- a town famed for churning out long-distance runners and playing host to Mo Farah's training camps. We reach it by driving through urban sprawl and out into the hills, passing a seemingly endless stream of impossibly fit athletes pounding the roadside paths.

Emily is busy cooking lunch when we arrive. Her kitchen is a small straw-capped mud hut built in the traditional style, similar to the other buildings that make up the homestead, with smoke pouring out of the door from an open fire and chickens scratching in the dirt nearby. It seems idyllic, but there's a killer on the loose around here, and we've come to track it down.

That killer is squamous cell oesophageal carcinoma -- one of the two main forms of oesophageal cancer, which starts from the cells lining the oesophagus. Cases started piling up more than 60 years ago in South Africa, when a doctor working in the Transkei territories noticed an unusually high number of people dying from the disease, which was almost unheard-of before the 1940s.

The situation in Africa seems to be no better today. Worldwide, an average of 5.9 people per 100,000 will develop oesophageal cancer each year. In East Africa, that figure rises to 9.7 people per 100,000. In Kenya specifically it's 18 in 100,000, while in Malawi it's even higher -- 24 in 100,000 -- making oesophageal cancer one of the three most common cancers in these countries.

But even after decades of investigation, we still don't really know what's causing these hotspots.

Smoke pours from an open stove in a rural kitchen near Iten, western Kenya.

East Africa isn't the only place in the world where this is happening. The Golestan region of Iran has one of the highest rates anywhere on Earth, and there are pockets of the disease in places as diverse as Henan province in north-central China and southern Brazil, although it's relatively rare in neighbouring Colombia.

Other parts of the world have their own cancer problems: there are strangely high rates of bowel cancer in Slovakia and Denmark, although they have low rates of liver cancer. People in the Czech Republic are more likely to be stricken by kidney or pancreatic cancer than the populations of neighbouring Austria and Poland.

Do these differences lie in inherited genetic variations, or is it something to do with lifestyle? Is there an unknown carcinogen lurking in the environment? Or maybe it's a bit of all three? The wild differences in rates of cancer across the world is a mystery -- but a crack team of detectives is on the case.

Leading this team is Mike Stratton, director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge, UK, one of the largest centres in the world for DNA sequencing and analysis. Together with Paul Brennan at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France -- the World Health Organization's cancer research arm -- and other teams in the UK and USA, Stratton has assembled the most impressive detective force in cancer research: a project known as Mutographs of Cancer

By peering deep inside the DNA of cancer cells, Stratton and his team are hunting for the unique mutational signatures that different cancer-causing agents and processes have left behind.

""I've been interested in the idea that you can detect evidence of the exposures that are causing cancer for 20 or 30 years,"" Stratton explains. ""A mutational signature is simply the pattern of mutations that is left by a mutational process, and a mutational process can be anything from exposing a cell to ultraviolet light to tobacco smoke to endogenous processes.""

The Mutographs team are recruiting 5,000 people across five continents with five different types of cancer, extracting and analysing DNA from thousands of tumours to build up a massive database of mutational signatures -- a bit like Interpol's international fingerprint database -- so they can try and match causes to cancers around the world.

The graves of Emily's mother and father who both died of oesophageal cancer within a few years of each other, outside Iten in western Kenya.

It's an ambitious £20 million project, funded by Cancer Research UK's Grand Challenge , and is only possible thanks to the international research connections of IARC and the sheer scale of the Sanger Institute's DNA-sequencing pipeline. And its findings have the potential to save many thousands of lives.

Cancer's genetic footprint

At its heart, cancer is a disease of DNA. The human genome contains 20,000 or so genes -- the biological instructions that tell our cells when to grow and multiply, what job to do in the body, and even when to die -- encoded within long strands of DNA known as chromosomes.

DNA itself is made from four chemical building blocks, or bases, which are strung together in endlessly varied combinations. It's the order of these bases -- adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C) -- that conveys the information within a gene, effectively acting like a molecular alphabet spelling out the recipes of life. Any changes to the letters in an important gene -- for example, one that drives cell proliferation -- might cause a cell to start multiplying out of control.

Further alterations in other vital genes, along with a cellular environment that allows or even encourages unchecked growth, will eventually lead to a tumour. If you can detect the DNA mutations that have led to the development of a person's cancer and work out what caused them, then you should have the solution to their biological whodunnit. But to do that, you need to be able to read DNA.

In the late 1970s, biochemist Fred Sanger developed a reliable method for reading the sequence of letters in a stretch of DNA, and the institute in Cambridge bears his name as a testament to this game-changing discovery. Sanger's original sequencing technique was time-consuming and cumbersome, allowing scientists to read a couple of hundred bases at best. So rather than looking at all six billion letters of the human genome in search of cancer-causing changes, researchers started by focusing on just one gene, p53, which is faulty in the majority of human cancers.

By the 1990s, Curtis Harris at the US National Cancer Institute and Bert Vogelstein at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore had managed to show that different types of cancer had their own unique suite of mutations in p53, which were likely to have been caused by different agents, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke or UV light from the sun.

A rural homestead near Iten, western Kenya.

Stratton -- then a young geneticist hunting for mutations in cancers affecting the muscles and other soft tissues -- was intrigued by the findings.

""These were very seminal papers which suggested that, yes, mutagens that cause cancer leave their mark on the genome,"" he recalls. ""That had a big impression on me as an opportunity for genomics, but it's one that had to be put away in the locker for 15 years waiting for the technology.""

That technology was next-generation sequencing : DNA-reading machines enabling scientists to move from reading hundreds of bases at a time to thousands or even millions. Straight away, Stratton saw the potential for the technology to revolutionise our understanding of the genetic changes inside individual tumours, setting the Sanger Institute's huge banks of DNA-sequencing machines in motion to read every single letter of DNA in a tumour.

By 2009, he and his team had produced the first whole cancer genome sequences. These were detailed maps showing all the genetic changes and mutations that had occurred within two individual cancers -- a melanoma from the skin and a lung tumour.

These choices of cancer types were far from random: decades of epidemiology and lab studies had shown that UV light exposure is likely to be the strongest sole cause of melanoma, while knowledge of the link between tobacco and lung cancer goes back to the 1950s. With such strong lead suspects, Stratton and his team had the best chance of finding clear mutational fingerprints in the genome. But although they were expecting to see the same kinds of mutations across the genomes that Harris and Vogelstein had already picked up in their single-gene studies, they weren't prepared for the sheer scale of genomic vandalism that they uncovered.

""The melanoma had something like 25,000 mutations, which was more than the world had ever seen in one genome,"" Stratton says. ""We could really see the signatures of the exposures that had taken place at an incredibly fine-grained resolution, and we could see all sorts of features and nuances that we hadn't noticed before.""

In the same way that a human fingerprint is a mixture of different patterns of ridges, mutational fingerprints are made up of characteristic patterns of DNA changes.

Carcinogenic chemicals cause mutations by physically binding to specific bases and affecting their shape. These alterations throw a molecular spanner in the works, holding up fundamental processes such as copying DNA or reading genes, so they have to be fixed to keep the cell healthy and functioning properly. For example, benzo(a)pyrene (one of the major carcinogens in tobacco smoke) tends to bind to G bases, as does aflatoxin, a cancer-causing chemical made by certain moulds. But each of these types of damage is repaired in a specific way, leaving a characteristic change in the DNA sequence.

By contrast, UV light leads to mutations by causing neighbouring Cs to become stuck together. When the DNA-copying machinery encounters these fused pairs, it interprets the unusual shape as being a pair of Ts, resulting in a permanent change in the DNA sequence in that position.

""In order to analyse and distinguish between these causes, we have to have a way of classifying the patterns of mutations, a bit like identifying a specific set of fingerprints according to the particular patterns of loops and whorls,"" Stratton explains.

Initially, Stratton and his team focused on six basic mutational signatures: C to A, C to G, C to T, T to A, T to C and T to G. But there are several different mutational processes that can convert, say, a C to a T, making it difficult to tell what may have been the underlying cause. The researchers then realised that certain mutations tend to appear in the context of certain DNA sequences, as a result of the specific chemical interactions or biological machinery at work.

By expanding out to look at the two bases either side of the mutation -- ACA changed to AAA, ACC to AAC, ACG to AAG and so on -- Stratton and his team ended up with 96 different subtypes of mutation. Different mutational processes lead to specific patterns across these 96, which pop out of a graphic representation almost as neatly as the ridges and lines of a human fingerprint.

There are also other distinctive changes found in the genomes of cancer cells -- including deletions or insertions of small sections of DNA, characteristic changes to consecutive base pairs, and larger alterations and rearrangements -- which can help to further refine the characteristic fingerprint of a particular mutational process.

The melanoma and lung cancer genomes were powerful proof that the fingerprints of specific culprits could be seen in cancers with one major cause. Yet these tumours still contained many mutations that couldn't be explained by UV or tobacco, so what was causing them? And what about cancers without such an obvious single cause? With thousands upon thousands of mutations in a typical tumour, the detective work becomes a lot trickier for cancers with complex, multiple or even completely unknown origins.

By way of analogy, imagine you're a forensic scientist dusting for fingerprints at a murder scene. You might strike it lucky and find a set of perfect prints on a windowpane or door handle that match a known killer in your database. But you're much more likely to uncover a mish-mash of fingerprints belonging to a whole range of folk -- from the victim and potential suspects to innocent parties and police investigators -- all laid on top of each other on all sorts of surfaces.

Fortunately, a PhD student of Stratton's, Ludmil Alexandrov (now an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego), came up with a way of solving the problem. He realised that the individual mutational signatures in a tumour can be distinguished from one another using a mathematical method called blind source separation, previously used to separate data from multiple sources, for example splitting out individual vocal and instrumental tracks from a single audio file.

Oesophageal tumour samples taken at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, in Eldoret, Kenya.

By 2013, the Sanger team had used a version of this technique to extract 20 distinct mutational fingerprints from nearly 5 million mutations in more than 7,000 tumours, covering 30 of the most common forms of cancer. Some fingerprints turned up in every single tumour, while others were specific to just a handful of cancer types. All of the cancers had at least two different fingerprints, while some had at least six.

That number rose in 2015 to at least 30 unique mutational fingerprints , each caused by a different agent. Then in 2018 an even larger analysis of nearly 85 million mutations in around 25,000 cancers raised the number of fingerprints to around 65, although probably only around 50 of these are truly unique.

Some of them come from things we already know can significantly increase the risk of cancer -- the usual suspects like tobacco or PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, released when certain materials burn). Some previously suspected carcinogens have also been confirmed as dangers, such as aristolochic acid, a chemical produced by plants that were commonly used in herbal supplements in Taiwan and elsewhere. Other fingerprints are signs of an inside job, resulting from the fundamental processes of life inside our cells, including DNA copying and repair.

But the causes of around half these fingerprints remain a mystery, left in the genomes of cancer cells by culprits that are still at large.

Finding factors in the field

The endoscopy suite in Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, western Kenya, is a busy place. Oesophageal cancer is one of the most common tumours around here, and every day a seemingly endless stream of patients arrive in search of relief from the bulging blockages in their gullets. Most have not eaten properly for weeks, making them incredibly thin and frail. Some have come hundreds of kilometres from the outlying rural areas, spending precious money on pricey hired transport. All of them are desperate for help, and most are going to die within the next year.

I watch as little pink globs of cancer tissue are carefully popped into plastic pots and sent off to a freezer in a building on the other side of the hospital, waiting to be shipped to IARC. The team there will purify the precious DNA from each sample, then send it to the Sanger Institute to be sequenced and analysed for any tell-tale mutational signatures that might explain what is causing all these cancers.

I'm here in Eldoret to meet Diana Menya, a Kenyan epidemiologist who has worked at the Moi for many years. She's generous and good-humoured, with an infectious energy. We feel like old friends after bouncing along in a minibus for just two days -- including an impromptu side trip to watch teenagers fling themselves off a cliff into a crocodile-infested pool -- and she is full of laughter and stories about the region and its inhabitants. It was this curiosity and passion for her local area that first alerted her to the unusually high rates of cancer in the region.

Dr. Diana Menya

""Some years ago, I noticed that there were quite a number of patients presenting with difficulty swallowing, and when the diagnosis was finally done it was squamous cell oesophageal cancer,"" Menya explains. ""We were seeing more and more patients coming into the hospital, and I was wondering: What is this? What is happening here? Something needs to be done.""

Her solution, collaborating with researchers at IARC, was to set up ESCCAPE (Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma African Prevention Research), a case--control study recruiting people who have oesophageal cancer and people who don't, to compare their environments and lifestyles. By working with Menya, the Mutographs of Cancer team have been able to get hold of tumour and blood samples for DNA analysis and then match them to the information gathered by the ESCCAPE team about the environmental or lifestyle factors that might be at work in the region.

Menya's study has already found that tobacco and alcohol are two of the factors likely to be responsible for the surfeit of oesophageal cancers in western Kenya -- not entirely surprising, given that previous epidemiological studies have linked them to squamous cell carcinoma. But although these two culprits may account for a lot of cases, they certainly can't explain them all.

Heading out into the rural community outside Iten feels like walking into a world of carcinogens. The farmland may be lush and fertile here, but it is also awash with pesticides and fertilisers that can leach into the (usually unfiltered) water supply. There are sprouting fields of collard greens that are cooked into a dish known locally as sukuma wiki ('lasts a week') that's particularly high in nitrates, which may then be converted into carcinogenic nitrosamines in the body.

We visit Emily in her kitchen -- a single unventilated room coated with a thick layer of soot that hangs down in some places like stalactites. The smoke from the open fire is overpowering, and it's impossible to stay in there for more than a few seconds without dashing out for air. And where there's smoke, there's PAHs, released from burning fuels such as wood, maize cobs and cow dung. Women, young girls and children are particularly exposed as they spend so much time in the kitchen, often sleeping in there at night to keep warm and safe.

Maize is a common food and fuel source in this area, and the cobs and kernels are often treated with fungicide to prevent the growth of toxic pink mould (which may itself cause cancer). Burning these chemicals along with the cobs may release further carcinogens into the unventilated atmosphere.

Then there are personal habits. It's common in East Africa to drink extremely hot tea, sipped at mouth-scalding temperatures of up to 70°C (something I discovered the hard way). Very hot drinks have already been linked with oesophageal cancer in Iran and parts of South America.

Poor dental hygiene could be another factor. A study in China has shown that the fewer teeth a person has, the greater their risk of oesophageal cancer, perhaps as a result of toxic bacterial chemicals leaching into the saliva from infected gums.

Although it's easy to suspect all these things (and more) as being behind the high oesophageal cancer rates in Kenya, we don't yet have enough data to link most of these risk factors with fingerprints left in the cancer genome. That means we don't yet know which of them are the most dangerous, or how they might act together to cause disease. In the future, we should be able to match more carcinogens with their fingerprints by combining the Mutographs approach with diligent epidemiological studies like ESCCAPE. But this isn't the only way.

Rather than studying DNA extracted from tumours to look for mutational signatures, David Phillips, a professor of environmental carcinogenesis at King's College London, is coming at the problem from the opposite direction. As part of the Mutographs project, he and his team are treating laboratory-grown cells with DNA-damaging agents, then sequencing their DNA to see what mutational signatures have been left.

Julia, a woman dying of oesophageal cancer in Kimbilio hospice in western Kenya.

""By looking in a systematic way in human tumours and comparing them with mutational signatures in experimental systems that are caused by things we think or know are carcinogenic to humans, we can match the two and say, 'Aha! Here is evidence that this particular chemical is involved,'"" Phillips explains. ""We're working our way independently through things that we suspect or know cause human cancers and seeing what signatures we can generate from those.""

So far Phillips and his team have tested 80 suspected causes of DNA damage, of which around half produce distinctive fingerprints in the genome. Some are known human carcinogens, such as UV light and aristolochic acid, which produce patterns of damage that would be expected based on their properties. Whenever those turn up in the Mutographs tumour samples, it's a fairly safe bet that the relevant agent is involved somewhere.

But he's found other chemicals that leave mutational signatures in lab-grown cells which haven't yet been detected in human tumours. Maybe these molecules are genuinely carcinogenic but it's rare that people get enough exposure for it to show up in their cancer cells, or maybe they're truly innocent and can be ruled out of Stratton's investigations.

It's a bit like catching someone speeding in a car, taking their fingerprints and putting them in a database: maybe they will never go on to commit a more serious crime, but if they do, then the police have a much better chance of catching them.

Saving the future

Right now, we're still in the opening pages of this detective story. A year after the Mutographs project began, a full team has been assembled, the tools are in place, and the researchers are starting to gather and analyse fingerprints from cancers all over the world. The sheer scale of the project is staggering.

""As we refined the sophistication of the approach and the mutation classification, the algorithms and the sequencing, it has become clear that this was a big challenge that would require coordinated investment and organisation,"" says Stratton. ""We have to collect five to ten thousand tumour samples and normal blood, we have to quality-control the DNA sequencing and do the data management and statistics -- it's a combination of large-scale epidemiology and large-scale genomics that haven't been married together in this way before.""

In June 2018, researchers from the Mutographs team gathered at the Sanger Institute to share preliminary data from the first handful of cancer genomes to make it through the project's pipeline. Intriguingly, the first few oesophageal tumours from Kenya don't appear to have any signatures from PAHs, potentially putting smoky rural kitchens like Emily's in the clear, although it's important to stress that only a small fraction of cases have been analysed so far.

Curiously, all the oesophageal cancers do have signs of damage caused by APOBECs -- DNA-altering proteins in our cells that are thought to be activated in response to viral infections. There's a lot of scientific hand-waving about the role that these internal mutators might play in cancer, and even less is known about what triggers their activity in the absence of viruses, but the discovery of their fingerprints at the biological scene of the crime is intriguing.

While it's too early to nail down any suspects for sure, in a plot twist worthy of Agatha Christie's""Murder on the Orient Express"" -- SPOILER ALERT -- it's becoming clear from the cancer genomes that we're not dealing with individual baddies but a gang of miscreants, each of whom administers a potentially fatal blow to the genome. Each causes mayhem in its own way, but they can combine to bring about catastrophe.

The flipside is that it's almost impossible to pinpoint one specific cause of a given tumour or say exactly what caused it. A cell may be riddled with mutations, accumulated from all sorts of processes over a lifetime, but if none of them hit the vital genes or control switches responsible for growth or death, then it will remain healthy. And because every cancer genome is shot through with many thousands of mutations, it's impossible to say which culprit delivered the coup de grâce. But we should be able to build up a much better picture of the contributions of different factors -- be they biological or environmental -- to each individual person's disease.

This research is coming too late to help Emily's parents, lying in their hillside graves. But Diana Menya is hopeful that her work will save lives in the future.

""I think it's a combination of environmental factors and behavioural factors. Something to do with what people do, what they eat, how they live and their habits, such as tobacco consumption and alcohol consumption. It could also be something like indoor air pollution,"" she says, calling to mind women like Emily and her smoke-filled kitchen. She's also hopeful the project will pick apart the roles of nature and nurture in causing Kenya's oesophageal cancer epidemic. ""We've got anecdotal information that it runs in families in our study site, but is it genetics or is it a shared environment? I'm hoping the Mutographs study can answer that question.""

This is real prevention research -- finding out what is increasing the risk of cancer at a fundamental level, then using the knowledge to make lasting life-saving changes in public health. But this takes time and it needs political will. Menya has already seen this approach bear fruit in her own work running a campaign to support the extermination of guinea worm across the country.

""To prevent a disease, we have to take action. We have eradicated many conditions, and especially infectious diseases, so can we not eradicate non-communicable diseases like cancer?"" Menya says. ""This is going to sound quite ambitious, but for me the best endgame will be a cancer-free Kenya by preventing cancers from occurring in the first place -- catching it before it catches the patients."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180924122948-04-dna-cancer-detectives-mosaic-092418-super-tease.jpg
f3fe5ac34f574466ade7095ed4532be0	['Meera Senthilingam']	2018-09-24 00:00:00	New device offers hope for people with heart failure	https://www.cnn.com/	US	New device offers hope for people with heart failure	1	"(CNN) A tiny new device is offering hope of a better life for people with severe heart failure, reducing hospitalization rates and improving mortality risk within two years of treatment, a new study finds .

Heart failure affects an estimated 5.7 million Americans and more than 26 million people globally , causing shortness of breath and tiredness among those affected as their heart struggles to pump blood around the body.

One cause of severe heart failure that currently has a poor prognosis is a leaky valve, particularly the leakage of the mitral valve, which control's blood flow in the left part of the heart. When leakage is severe, the heart can enlarge.

Estimated to affect more than two million people in the US, failure of the mitral valve causes blood to flow backwards when pumped out, meaning it can't reach the rest of the body efficiently.

But a new device -- called a MitraClip -- clips the faulty valve back together, helping it work properly and pump blood out of the heart. It has now shown promising results in the study published Sunday.

Drugs are available to ease symptoms of a leaky mitral valve, but the long-term effects are unknown, the authors write. Surgery is also an option, and can be curative, but brings significant risk of complications, as patients are often older and more frail.

Implanting the MitraClip is minimally invasive, with the device transferred up through a small incision in the groin, and has now been shown to reduce recovery time and hospitalization, according to the study.

To measure the effectiveness of the device, Dr. Gregg Stone, professor of medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians, and his team enrolled 614 patients from the US and Canada with heart failure and moderate to severe secondary mitral valve regurgitation -- a leaky mitral valve -- who continued to have symptoms despite being on drug treatment for their condition. The secondary form of the condition is when a person's left ventricle is damaged, prohibiting the valve from functioning properly.

Of the participants, 302 were given the new device and 312 acted as controls. Among those who received the MitraClip, there were 32.1% fewer hospitalizations per year within to years of follow-up.

""The annualized rate of all hospitalizations for heart failure within 24 months was 35.8% per patient-year in the device group as compared with 67.9% per patient-year in the control group,"" the authors wrote.

Overall mortality from any cause within those two years was also 17% lower among patients who were implanted with the device compared with the control group, at 29.1% and 46.1%, respectively.

""It's shocking how positive it is as a new therapy for patients whose hearts are very weak,"" said Dr. Michael Acker, the chief of the Division of Cardiovascular Surgery at Penn Medicine. Acker, who is not connected to the research, noted the study findings were far more encouraging than the results of a similar trial reported last month. ""On face value, it is very exciting,"" he said, but he indicated that further study was necessary to understand the differences in the population groups of each study.

The MitraClip technique was first pioneered in 2003 and approved by the FDA in October 2013 to treat the primary (or degenerative) form of mitral regurgitation, according to researchers at the University of Washington.

It's use to treat the secondary form of the condition is currently under investigation and has not yet been approved by the FDA.

The new study was part of the COAPT trial for secondary mitral regurgitation and funded by American health care company Abbott, which produces the device."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180208120028-heart-attack-super-tease.jpg

Researchers at University College London found that rates of Acanthamoeba keratitis, an infection of the cornea, have nearly tripled since 2011 in the southeast of England.

Infection with Acanthamoeba, a cyst-forming microorganism, causes an inflammation of the cornea. Symptoms include excessive pain and compromised vision.

The disease is mostly preventable, said Dr. John Dart, a consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital who led the research.

""It was clear that there is a problem,"" he said. ""Acanthamoeba keratitis is one of the worst corneal infections.""

Studies suggest that about 2 in 100,000 contact lens wearers in the UK are affected each year, aided by the way water is stored and supplied there, according to Moorfields Eye Hospital , meaning case numbers are higher in the UK than in other parts of the world.

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates occurrence at one or two cases in every million lens wearers; 85% of cases will occur in lens wearers.

The new study identified a surge in the UK.

Dart's team analyzed incidence data collected by Moorfields, where cases across the southeast of England are treated, and found an average of 50.3 cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis per year between 2011 and 2016, up from an average of 18.5 in prior years, between outbreaks.

""Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare infection, but when it occurs, it has a devastating effect for a long period of time on the patient's life,"" Dart said. ""Only 70% of patients were cured within 12 months. For the remaining 30%, the treatment took over a year.""

The researchers say their findings apply across the UK, given that Moorfields Eye Hospital treats more than 35% of the country's cases.

Acanthamoeba keratitis is 20 times less likely than bacterial infections among contact lens wearers. Severe occurrences take up to 10 months to treat with antiseptic eye drops followed by 38 months of followup visits, according to the new study.

The most severe cases also lead to a permanent 75% decrease in vision because of scarring of the cornea, with a quarter of patients requiring corneal transplants, Dart said. He explained that corneal transplant surgeries are sometimes necessary to treat holes in patients' eyes due to ulcers caused by the infection or to restore vision.

Irenie Ekkeshis, a 39-year-old daily disposable contact lens wearer, was diagnosed with Acanthamoeba keratitis in 2011, despite strict lens hygiene.

Irenie Ekkeshis, 39, developed Acanthamoeba keratitis in 2011.

She remembers waking one morning in January that year with horrific pain and a sore eye ""that was very sensitive to bright light."" The pain worsened over time, and Ekkeshis knew that something was ""very wrong"" with her eye.

Her treatment took three years because the standard treatment with antiseptic eye drops was not effective. She had to undergo several other procedures, including two corneal transplant surgeries, she said.

Dr. Frank Larkin, senior lecturer at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Imperial College School of Medicine, said current treatments are ""not good enough.""

""The Acanthamoeba organism is very resistant to drugs, which is the main reason some patients' treatments take such a long time,"" said Larkin, who was not involved in the new study.

Almost eight years after her diagnosis, Ekkeshis regularly visits Moorfields because of problems linked to her cornea transplant.

She now campaigns to increase awareness of the infection, specifically advocating for a written warning on contact lens packaging on the importance of avoiding their contamination with water -- one way to prevent the infection.

Ninety percent of Acanthamoeba keratitis cases in the UK are discovered in contact lens wearers, due to most risk factors being related to lens hygiene, Dart said.

The infection is most commonly found in hard-water areas, where lime scale allows for an optimal environment for the Acanthamoeba microorganism to grow.

A separate analysis in the study on more than 270 people who use reusable contact lenses found that the risk of developing the disease was more than three times higher among those with poor contact lens hygiene, people who did not always wash and dry their hands before handling their lenses, those who used disinfectant products containing Oxipol (now phased out by the manufacturer), and people who wore their lenses in swimming pools or hot tubs.

Showering and face-washing while wearing contact lenses are also likely to be risk factors, the study found.

""There is an increased risk with a particular disinfectant, Oxipol, and it is good news that the manufacturer has phased it out,"" said Dr. Ravi Goel, a US ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, who was not involved in the new study. ""Any infection related to contact lens use is serious. [This] is a rare form of infection, so we need to raise our patients' awareness.""

""You cannot point at just one risk factor. ... That is the most important part of the study.""

Dart advises contact users to buy daily disposable contacts or else ensure that lenses and their containers are not contaminated by tap water.

Larkin thinks ""contact lens wearers should be concerned.""

""There has been a gradual and large increase in AK in contact lens wearers, despite more people are using disposable contact lenses, which carry a lower risk of the infection."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180920140959-04-acanthamoeba-keratitis-rare-eye-infection-super-tease.jpg
478c3ed96dd84d4b91df00f1cefce83d	['Susan Scutti']	2018-09-20 00:00:00	Puppies to blame for drug-resistant infection in 118 people	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Puppies to blame for drug-resistant infection in 118 people	1	"(CNN) From January 2017 through February 2018, puppies sold at six pet store companies led to infections in 118 people in 18 states, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday.

The cause of illness: Campylobacter, common bacteria that can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever, according to the CDC outbreak report published as part of its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

No deaths occurred, though 26 people were hospitalized. Samples of the bacteria from patients showed resistance to all antibiotics commonly used to treat Campylobacter infections, including macrolides and quinolones, according to the CDC.

Most patients will recover from a Campylobacter infection within five days without treatment, though drinking extra fluids is recommended. In rare cases, an infection can lead to complications, including paralysis and even death. People with weakened immune systems, such as infants, the elderly and those with cancer or other severe illnesses, are most at risk of serious infection.

Sanitation and handling

The investigation began in August 2017, when the Florida Department of Health notified the CDC of six Campylobacter infections linked to a national pet store chain based in Ohio. Information from an examination of data prompted a multistate investigation to identify the source of outbreak and to prevent additional illness.

The CDC identified 118 people, including 29 store employees, who became ill between January 5, 2016, and February 4, 2018. Patients ranged in age from younger than 1 year old to 85, and most (63%) were female. States reporting illness were Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

Of the patients interviewed by the CDC, the overwhelming majority -- 99% -- reported direct contact with a dog, and 95% said the dog they'd touched was a pet store puppy. The health agency noted that most infections with campylobacteriosis stem from eating raw or undercooked poultry, unpasteurized dairy products, contaminated water and produce. And although infection usually does not spread from person to person, having sex with an infected person or changing an infected person's diapers can increase the risk.

Though the CDC report does not name pet stores involved in the outbreak, Petland, a national pet store chain, was implicated in the original CDC outbreak notifications.

""As a result of the inquiry, the CDC had no new recommendations for Petland other than to continue our established practice of in-store hand sanitization and education,"" the chain's director of public affairs, Elizabeth Kunzelman, wrote in an email.

Store records reviewed during the outbreak investigation revealed that 142 of the 149 investigated puppies had received one or more courses of antibiotics, according to the CDC.

Common-sense care

""At Petland all decisions relating to the use of antibiotics is determined by each of our store's independent, licensed, consulting veterinarians who are responsible for examining each of our puppies and determining any medical treatment,"" Kunzelman said. ""We expect veterinarians to practice appropriate discretion with antibiotics on puppies, just as we would expect the same from pediatricians with babies.""

Mike Bober, president and CEO of the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council, which works directly with the CDC to develop educational programs for pet owners as well as industry and governmental organizations, said, ""outbreaks of this kind certainly point to a need to make sure that everyone involved in the handling of animals is well-trained and follows important hygiene and handling practices that place an emphasis on preventing and taking steps to avoid disease transmission.""

Because animals are living creatures, disease will arise on occasion, he said. ""It's not something we can just sanitize out of existence.""

""We do think it is responsible care and common-sense care that is the best approach here,"" Bober said. Wash your hands thoroughly and exercise care and caution when cleaning up after animals, since disease can be transmitted through fecal matter.

The CDC also advises pet owners contact their veterinarians if they see signs of illness in a puppy or dog.

""Pet ownership is a tremendously positive thing in people's lives,"" Bober said. ""More than two-thirds of Americans have pets, and the health benefits of the human animal bond far outweighs the risks that come with these naturally occurring organisms."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131223081810-01-sf-puppy-1223-story-top.jpg
f37ad2b51b3243eda2b1fd0d181a4402	['Jessica Ravitz']	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Decades after their own sexual assaults, women put themselves in shoes of Kavanaugh's accusers	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Decades after their own sexual assaults, women put themselves in shoes of Kavanaugh's accusers	1	"(CNN) Her Catholic boyfriend said he was waiting until marriage to have sex, so she felt safe. But after she passed out fully clothed on prom night, she woke up naked with him on top of and inside her. She got pregnant that night, 36 years ago, and he paid for her abortion. Then he mailed a letter to tell her she was going to hell.

Five drunken frat boys piled on top of a college sophomore, who was sober, as the party's loud music drowned out her screams in the dark room. They grabbed at and groped her. One of them penetrated her with his finger before she broke free and ran.

A 19-year-old studying abroad woke up to a young man fondling her and masturbating in her face. An older boy plied a 15-year-old with booze and, after she passed out at a house party, stole her virginity. Another young woman took the cocktail a cute guy offered on her 21st birthday. She didn't know what to call it when the same guy had his way with her after she grew woozy, they left the bar and her body went numb. More than a decade later, when a friend of friends assaulted her, dislocated her jaw and left her bruised, she knew the word: rape.

These are just a sampling of the dozens of stories of sexual assault that were shared with me in recent days by phone, email and through social media. They are accounts from women in their 30s, 40s and 50s who I asked to reflect on their younger years, mostly in high school and college. They spoke out on the condition that they, and the accused, would remain anonymous.

Some called their sexual assaults a ""cliché,"" perhaps too common to be worth mentioning. One woman simply quipped, ""Is there a woman who made it through college without this experience?""

With decades-old allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by Judge Brett Kavanaugh making headlines and threatening to derail his Supreme Court nomination, we've entered a new chapter in the #MeToo movement. Women are thinking back to their own experiences, many of them for the first time in years. They're talking about their assaults online, in their homes and at dinner parties.

What are these stories stirring up in women? Are they putting themselves in the shoes of Kavanaugh's accusers? And do they think they could or would come forward themselves if the men who assaulted them were suddenly poised for positions of power?

'Every scream I never screamed'

Plenty of those I heard from spent years blaming themselves and few, if they knew who their attackers were, reported anything to authorities or other adults, including parents. Those who did learned quickly why most girls and women don't . They weren't believed, felt ashamed and didn't see justice served. They were fed the ""boys will be boys"" line, even by their mothers.

Some had never shared their stories before; others only with select family members or friends.

There were those who were relatively unscathed by their experiences. Others were not so fortunate and have years of therapy behind them to prove it. One woman said she dropped out of college for a year and couldn't have an intimate relationship for eight years after her rape. The one who lost her virginity against her will at 15 listed off a series of subsequent assaults and spent much of her adult life struggling with low self-esteem and trying not to ""feel like a slut.""

The last time she was assaulted, she was nearly 40. She was walking through a park in broad daylight when a man approached from behind, thrust his hand up her skirt and grabbed her crotch.

""At first I froze, but then I started to scream,"" she said. ""I couldn't stop screaming. ... It was every scream I never screamed.""

They were assaulted by men or boys they didn't know, and ones they were fixed up with, knew since childhood or were dating. One woman's attacker was a longtime crush; a second's a best friend. A third woman's attacker was a graduate student she looked up to as an undergrad; he was the ""golden boy"" in the academic department who could make or break her professional future. A fourth's supervised summer legislative interns on Capitol Hill.

A fifth woman revealed she was assaulted by three men -- relatives or people connected to family members.

""Until their parents die, until they move away and I never have to see their face again, until I die -- most will never know that these people who walk among us have this fundamentally broken way of treating women,"" she wrote in a social media post.

To come forward about these men before then wouldn't be ""worth the headache,"" she said. But, ""if any of these people got anywhere near one of the highest offices in the land, I'd air their dirty laundry. ... Bless this woman (referring to Christine Blasey Ford) as she walks through this fire. I'm frankly relieved that I likely won't ever be in her shoes.""

'Bookend to Brock Turner'

For some, this moment has been triggering. One woman called it a ""bookend to Brock Turner,"" a story that hit a number of the women I heard from harder than this. Turner is the former Stanford University student who, in January 2015, was caught on campus, outside a fraternity, sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster. He was sentenced to six months in jail but only served three.

One woman said the election of President Donald Trump was what did her in. She couldn't stop crying and was inconsolable the day after he won.

""I felt like my country had just said that a man who was known to be a serial sexual assaulter was worthy to hold the highest office, which meant that it was okay to assault women,"" she wrote.

The growing activism of women give many of them hope, even if they fear that what they want to see will take time.

""The ground beneath these men has shifted in ways that they are still not prepared for,"" one woman said.

They want to think, though, that high schoolers and college students are more sensitive and aware, better equipped to call sexual assault what it is and more inclined to speak up. They're afraid they may not be right.

If they could talk to their younger selves, they'd take them by the shoulders and tell them they didn't deserve the wrongs pushed on them.

Their own parents didn't talk to them in ways they talk to their own children. Their little ones, sons and daughters, learn about consent early and aren't required to hug or touch anyone they don't want to hug or touch. They're given lessons in boundaries and understand they have agency over their own bodies.

Some have told their older kids what happened to them, while others say the details are something they'll never share. They don't shy away from using words such as rape and assault. They talk openly about relationships and how to honor partners. They insist their sons treat girls and women -- really, everyone -- with respect and tell their daughters to be vigilant.

One woman is waiting for the day when her kids will let her sign them up for self-defense classes.

'A skeleton' in his closet

They question if they'd come forward like Kavanaugh's accusers.

There are those who can't fathom putting their own lives under the microscope or exposing their families to the fallout. Some look back and, even after all these years, worry that they were partially to blame. One said she'd want to dig into her attacker's more recent past, see if he's shown respect for women and allow for the chance that he'd changed. Others want to believe that if the greater good depended on it, they'd be as brave.

""The more 'the public' sees that this happened to countless women who did not report it, the harder it will be to deny the accusations of those who do come forward,"" one woman wrote in an email. ""We can't all be liars.""

A few women mentioned that they've Googled the men who assaulted them. They've monitored their lives and careers. One woman decided, timed with the 30th anniversary of her assault, to send the now-family man a letter. She never expected to hear from him -- and she didn't. She did it for herself. By putting words to what she's lived with all these years, she felt better.

At one point the prom date who once vowed he was waiting until marriage to have sex, and then paid for an abortion after he raped his date, held a job in a state attorney's office.

""I remember back then wondering what I would do if I learned he was running for public office. It seemed plausible that he would,"" the woman said. ""I wondered if he considered me and my abortion a skeleton in his Republican closet.""

Just days after she first typed #MeToo on her Facebook page last year, even though they had no friends in common, he sent her a Facebook friend request. It was the first contact he'd made with her since he'd written 35 years earlier to tell her she was going to hell.

It felt a bit like ""a litmus test,"" she said. Would her accepting, in his mind, mean he was safe?

She waited a few days and then accepted.

She did it not because she was letting him off the hook. She accepted because she wanted him to see her every post, to know how strong she is."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180926122705-20180926-sexual-assault-super-tease.jpg

Diet followers having a 33% lower risk of being diagnosed with depression

(CNN) A Mediterranean diet -- rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts and fish -- could help lower a person's risk of depression, a new study says.

The research, published Wednesday , analyzed 41 studies on the topic and found a link between people's diet and their chances of developing depression.

People who followed a strict Mediterranean diet had a 33% lower risk of being diagnosed with depression compared to people who were least likely to follow these eating habits.

""There is compelling evidence to show that there is a relationship between the quality of your diet and your mental health,"" said Camille Lassale, research associate at University College London's department of epidemiology and public health in the UK. ""This relationship goes beyond the effect of diet on your body size or other aspects of health that can in turn affect your mood.""

People whose diets were high in inflammatory substances, such as processed meats, trans fats and alcohol, were more likely to have depressive outcomes.

Steaming in the microwave is preferable to submerging foods in water, which can result in a loss of nutrients

(CNN) Microwave ovens provide an easy way to quickly heat food when hunger strikes. But does the convenience of microwave cooking come at a cost by zapping nutrients out of foods?

The answer may surprise you.

Any kind of cooking method will result in some nutrient losses, so a better way to look at the issue is to what degree nutrients are depleted, explained Scott A. Rankin, professor and chair of the Department of Food Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. And ""typical microwave heating results in very minimal loss of valuable nutrients in food,"" Rankin said.

The factors that affect nutrient losses in foods during cooking include time (the longer the food is cooked, the more nutrient loss); temperature (the more heat, the more losses); and the amount of liquid the food is cooked in (the more water, the more nutrients you will probably lose as they leach into the cooking liquid).

Seattle, where recreational use of marijuana was legalized in 2012, is doing something about it.

All seven judges on the city's municipal court agreed this week to vacate convictions from 1996 to 2010 for misdemeanor marijuana possession, saying that they disproportionally impacted people of color.

Of the more than 500 cases cited, 46% involved African-American defendants, the judges said in their ruling.

As of July 2017, the population of Seattle was about 7% African-American, according to US Census data

More than 500 people in the city will see their marijuana-related convictions set aside if they were prosecuted before the state of Washington legalized weed. According to the ruling, vacating the convictions ""serves the interests of justice.""

The racial demographics of the other defendants in the 500-plus cases broke down as follows: 46% white, 3% Asian, 3% Native American, 2% unknown.

The convictions will be cleared by mid-November after the courts mail notices to the defendants to give them a chance to object or ask for individualized findings. Anyone who does not respond will have their conviction automatically vacated.

The decision, Mayor Jenny Durkan said , will help tear down the barriers to opportunity created by marijuana convictions.

""We've taken another important step to right the wrongs of the failed war on drugs, and to build true economic opportunity for all,"" she said. ""While we cannot reverse all the harm that was done, we will continue to act to give Seattle residents -- including immigrants and refugees -- a clean slate.""

Washington voters approved legalizing marijuana as a tax revenue measure in 2012. Initiative 502 legalized and regulated the production, possession and distribution of cannabis for people who were 21 and older.

The motion to vacate the convictions was filed in April by Seattle city attorney Pete Holmes, who argued that African-Americans were three times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites and that the charges could have a damaging impact on a person's future.

""Dismissing this charge reflects Seattle's values and recognizes the negative collateral consequences of a drug conviction, including difficulty in finding employment or getting into college or the military, obtaining student loans or government subsidized housing qualifying for food stamps or other government assistance, being allowed entry into some foreign countries and obtaining child custody or adoption,"" the motion stated.

The Seattle City Attorney's Office stopped prosecuting marijuana-possession cases after Holmes was elected in 2010, according to his office.

963b91de96604d81b60a6b4b6295513f	['Susan Scutti']	2018-09-25 00:00:00	WHO concerned as Congo faces 'perfect storm' for Ebola to spread	https://www.cnn.com/	US	WHO concerned as Congo faces 'perfect storm' for Ebola to spread	1	"(CNN) Ebola virus disease has sickened 150 people and caused the deaths of at least 69 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo's northeastern region, the nation's Ministry of Health reported Monday .

Of these 150 cases, 119 have been confirmed and 31 are probable. An additional 31 deaths have occurred among probable and suspected cases, which would bring total Ebola deaths to 100 once confirmed. Forty-one people have recovered, according to the ministry.

""We have passed the sad mark of 100 deaths,"" Dr. Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, said Tuesday. ""The response is facing a series of grave obstacles.""

After weeks of control efforts having made impact, Salama expressed concern the outbreak could now worsen due to attacks in the region, movement of people and distrust in the community.

""We are now extremely concerned that several factor may be coming together over the next weeks to months to create the potential perfect storm,"" he said, outlining the harms of ""active conflict limiting our ability to access civilians, distrust by a community, already traumatized by decades of conflict and of murder, driven by a fear of a terrifying disease but also exploited and manipulated by local politicians prior to an election.""

Parts of the local population are refusing treatment because of distrust and superstitions, he said.

A violent clash in Beni on Sunday, attributed to the Alliance of Democratic Forces, led to the death of at least 21 people, including 17 civilians, according to Salama.

""The response at this stage is at a critical juncture,"" he said. ""We have seen an increased frequency and increased severity of attacks by armed opposition groups in recent weeks.""

In a tweet, Salama communicated that the Ebola response teams in the city of Beni were on lockdown beginning Sunday.

WHO #Ebola response teams in Beni #DRC are on lockdown today, unable to move because of security concerns following violence by armed rebel groups over the weekend when many civilians were killed. — Peter Salama (@PeteSalama) September 24, 2018

Those on lockdown include the teams that distribute vaccinations, those who track family, friends and others who came in contact with those infected, and those who educate the public by working directly with the community. In its daily report, the Ministry of Health stated that ""many residents of the city of Beni took to the streets on Sunday to protest the growing insecurity in the area."" The Ministry added that field activities will resume ""as soon as calm returns to the city.""

This suspension of activity in Beni was addressed by Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, Minister of Health, in a separate statement posted Monday

""All the pillars of the response remain fully operational,"" he wrote. He specified that the Beni Ebola Treatment Center remains open to patients, vaccinations continue and free health care remains available at approved centers, including to victims of violence.

Teams of health care personnel in areas outside Beni are continuing to conduct field work, including providing vaccinations, according to WHO.

But ""80% of people that are at risk of Ebola, at direct and immediate risk, were unable to be followed up yesterday in Beni,"" Salama said Tuesday.

'Wide geographical spread'

The North Kivu province is the epicenter of the outbreak, though some cases have been reported in neighboring Ituri province as well, according to WHO. Together, the two provinces, which are among the most populated in the nation, border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.

Congo is concurrently experiencing a long-term humanitarian crisis that includes intermittent armed conflict, according to WHO. As a result, other health epidemics, including cholera, measles and polio, as well as human trafficking, are flourishing there.

More than 1 million internally displaced people are in North Kivu and Ituri, according to WHO; the movement of refugees through and out of the provinces is a potential risk factor for spread of Ebola.

In a tweet posted Monday, Salama stated that a case in Tchioma, an area of Congo that borders Uganda, ""raises concern about further spread.""

Case of #Ebola in Tchioma #DRC raises concern about further spread:



1. This is a newly affected area

2. It is in an area which borders Uganda

3. The person actively avoided our teams and refused care



Multidisciplinary team travelled Sunday, arrived today to set up response. — Peter Salama (@PeteSalama) September 24, 2018

On Tuesday he explained ""this case is very close to the Kasen airport on the the riverbanks of lake Albert which has of course direct connectivity across the lake to Uganda. That area is entirely surrounded by a different rebel group...We are dealing now with 3 active armed opposition groups.""

Public health teams are also investigating nine suspected cases not included among the 150, the ministry reported.

""We now have wide geographical spread of Ebola,"" said Salama. ""Into red zones, into border areas with surrounding countries such as Uganda.""

On average, Ebola kills about half of those infected , but case fatality rates in individual outbreaks have varied from 25% to 90%.

Ebola, which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging, most commonly affects people and nonhuman primates, such as monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees. This is a second, separate outbreak that has occurred in Congo so far this year, according to the World Health Organization. A previous outbreak, which began in May and ended in July, affected a western region of the country where 54 cases of Ebola virus were recorded, including 33 deaths.

Beginning with the 1976 discovery of Ebola in an area that is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the country has experienced 10 outbreaks, including this year's outbreaks.

Thousands vaccinated

Since August 8 , the Ministry has been inoculating people at high risk of an Ebola infection: primary and secondary contacts of those with confirmed Ebola infections.

More than 11,700 people have now been vaccinated, according Salama, who described this as ""the largest scale we have ever seen of the use of Ebola vaccine in the midst of a response.""

Despite the successful Ebola vaccine campaign, WHO encountered some community resistance in a small village, Ndindi, surrounding the city of Beni. Ndindi has been responsible for a large number of Ebola cases over the last few weeks.

The experimental rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, made by pharmaceutical company Merck, proved highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to WHO.

Ebola virus spreads through direct contact with either bodily fluids or objects contaminated by someone ill with the disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In some cases, the virus is spread from contact with someone who has died from the disease. The virus enters the body through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose or mouth. People can get it through sexual contact, as well.

""Beyond the medical response, the only way to end the Ebola Virus Disease epidemic remains the mobilization and commitment of the community alongside the health authorities,"" Kalenga said in a statement.

Salama called for continued response from the International Community to ensure provinces and countries are prepared.

""We call on governments In surrounding countries to accelerate their preparedness, which they have begun, to ensure that if - as is increasingly possible - this outbreak spreads across international borders we are all collectively prepared to top it before it gets out of control,"" he said."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180606112019-ebola-health-workers-0601-super-tease.jpg

Researchers studied drug users in two cities and found they were up to about three times more likely than the general population to have remnants of the HK2 virus within a particular gene in their DNA.

The virus dates back at least to Neanderthals and is present in the RASGRF2 gene -- which a researcher called the ""pleasure gene"" because it increases the activity of dopamine in the brain -- in about 5% to 10% of people.

That proportion of the population could therefore be more disposed to addictive behavior, the scientists said.

The team, from the universities of Oxford and Athens, found the virus in 34% of drug users tested in Glasgow, Scotland, compared to 9.5% of the local population, and in 14% of Greek patients, compared to 6% of that country's population.

0a7cec25a9654e28a6f6bdce9cd0bed5	['Michael Nedelman']	2018-09-24 00:00:00	Drugmaker touts benefits of fish oil derivative, experts reserve judgment	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Drugmaker touts benefits of fish oil derivative, experts reserve judgment	1	"(CNN) Irish pharmaceutical company Amarin sent a glowing announcement to investors Monday that its drug Vascepa, a purified fish oil derivative, was linked to a 25% reduced risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke.

While some doctors saw this announcement as a stunning and unexpected result that could change medical practice, others are reserving their judgment until the company shares its data, which have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

""This trial certainly strengthens the idea that treating people with cardiovascular disease [and] with elevated triglycerides resulted in a reduction in cardiovascular events,"" said Dr. Howard Weintraub , a preventive cardiologist and clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Health. Weintraub was a co-investigator of the trial.

But experts say these findings were not widely expected. The science behind fish oil and cardiovascular health has been inconclusive, and many studies have not shown a benefit. Vascepa is derived from a single omega-3 fatty acid isolated from fish.

""I want to see the numbers,"" said cardiologist Dr. Russell Luepker, a Mayo professor of public health at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the trial. ""This is just a tiny fraction of the data that they undoubtedly have. And undoubtedly what they've given us is the best data they have.

""This is almost like a press release to generate buzz.""

Amarin shares closed on Friday at $2.99, opened Monday above $10 and rose throughout the day.

Cardiologist Dr. Rita Redberg described the announcement as ""remarkably free of data"" and said that initial buzz surrounding drug-related announcements hasn't always panned out.

""This is potentially very interesting. I just don't think there's enough here to know,"" said Redberg, also a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.

In its statement, the drug maker also cautioned, ""Existing and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on topline results.""

More results from the trial will be presented on November 10 at a meeting of the American Heart Association in Chicago. Investigators say they also plan to publish the results in a peer-reviewed journal, according to the company statement.

Weintraub said that the trial could have succeeded where others failed for three reasons: the specific fish oil component they used, the higher dose of four grams per day and the type of patient it was given to.

The 8,179 patients in the double-blinded study had LDL levels in the normal range, controlled by statins, as well as ""persistent elevated triglycerides,"" another kind of lipid, ranging from 150 to 499 mg/dL. In addition, they either had ""established cardiovascular disease,"" or they had Type 2 diabetes and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor. Patients were followed for a median 4.9 years.

Weintraub said that while there have been plenty of studies on statins and cholesterol, triglycerides haven't gotten the same attention on their own -- part of what makes this trial unique.

""I've always viewed triglycerides as the Rodney Dangerfield of lipids -- they didn't get enough respect,"" he said.

Still, he said it's unclear whether the drug prevents cardiovascular events by acting directly on triglycerides, or whether they are a marker for some other process going on in our bodies -- ""secret sauce,"" as he says. Or perhaps some combination of the two, he added.

The company described the drug as ""well tolerated,"" with ""similar"" rates of adverse events between those who got the drug and those who received a placebo.

The drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 to lower triglycerides in excess of 500 mg/dL.

Roughly a quarter of Amercans age 20 and older have elevated triglycerides, according to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. High triglycerides are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in combination with low HDL and high LDL, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency says lifestyle choices can help lower triglycerides, including exercise, weight loss, diet and quitting smoking.

Heart disease is the top cause of death in the US, leading to the deaths of more than 600,000 per year.

""There's still some debate on how important [triglycerides are], but I've gradually come to the opinion that it is important. But whether treating it is important -- there are a bunch of trials that have been, at best, ambiguous about that,"" Luepker said.

price of nearly $350, though many consumers will likely pay less, according to A bottle of 120 1-gram capsules of Vascepa has an average cashprice of nearly $350, though manyconsumers will likely pay less, according to GoodRx , whose numbers are based on sources including published price lists, purchases, claims records and pharmacy data.

Weintraub said that the topline results may have granted a sneak peek, but that's hardly the end of the story. A deeper dive into the data could help illuminate whose risk was slashed the most, to what degree, and what other differences were seen between subgroups in the trial. For example, do the people with the highest triglycerides derive the greatest benefit? Is the effect the same in men and women, in people with or without diabetes?

""It may turn out to be worthwhile,"" said Luepker, but the announcement ""does not give me enough information to make a reasoned judgment of whether this is good, bad or indifferent.""

Weintraub, however, said that he wouldn't hesitate to prescribe the drug to patients like those in the trial, given what he described as a very favorable side effect profile and strong topline results.

Peripheral information, like what day it was or what someone wore, may fall away or grow fuzzy, especially with time. But the most distressing moments get ""locked in"" and remain ""very salient,"" explained Dean Kilpatrick, a clinical psychologist and director of the National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center at the Medical University of South Carolina.

Kilpatrick, a senior investigator in the medical school's department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, has spent more than 40 years working with sexual assault survivors. He knows the subject well.

""Memory is not like a video camera"" and can't capture everything, he said. But life's most impactful experiences -- whether they be positive or negative -- stay in focus.

Fears of being killed

All of this is pertinent as Christine Blasey Ford considers testifying and answering questions about accusations she's made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Ford says the Supreme Court nominee sexually assaulted her more than three decades ago, when they were both high school students.

Kavanaugh has denied the accusation that he sexually assaulted Ford while drunk at a party in the early '80s.

In a letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein , Ford shared her memories. She recalled the drunken laughter of Kavanaugh and his friend, the loud music meant to drown out her cries for help, Kavanaugh's hand that covered her mouth.

""I feared he may inadvertently kill me,"" she wrote.

About half of sexual assault survivors, when asked whether they worried about being seriously injured or killed, say they did, Kilpatrick said.

""If they say 'yes' to that, it predicts more likelihood of long-term mental health problems,"" he said.

Ford told the Washington Post about her years of feeling ""derailed"" and how she's struggled with anxiety and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Cementing painful memories

Not only are women who've experienced a sexual assault likely to remember their assaults, they tend to have memories that are more vivid than women who've experienced other sorts of traumas, such as car accidents, a new study shows.

""They were more likely to see the trauma in their mind, to see the contextual layout, and to consider it a significant part of their life story,"" said Tracey Shors, a professor of neuroscience at Rutgers University, who co-authored the study published this month in Frontiers in Psychiatry.

Memories of sexual violence also tended to linger, with victims reporting significantly more ""ruminations"" of the incident -- recurring thoughts about the past -- than those who remembered other stressful life events. That sort of thinking can cement the painful memories, making it difficult to move past them, the study showed.

""When you bring up a memory from the past,"" Shors explained, ""you actually make another memory in your brain, because you bring it up in the present.""

The study also found that those with recurring thoughts of their trauma were more likely to have other symptoms, she said, ""like depression, anxiety and what we call post-traumatic cognitions.""

Victims of sexual violence reported 44% more depressive symptoms and twice as many symptoms of anxiety than those who had no history with sexual violence, the study showed.

""If you're thinking a lot about the past,"" Shors said, ""you're also probably worried about the future.""

And when it comes to sexual violence, those sorts of fears can become debilitating.

'Depends on where you sit'

Kilpatrick can't help but see an irony in the latest headlines about Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh.

More than eight years ago, he appeared before the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary to talk about rape. The title of his prepared testimony: ""Rape in the United States: The Chronic Failure to Report and Investigate Rape Cases.""

He does not know Kavanaugh's accuser. But based on what he's gathered, he said, he sees something ""very consistent with what has happened with a lot of sexual assault victims.""

She didn't report the incident to authorities; the vast majority of women don't. Fewer than 20% of rape cases are reported, Kilpatrick said.

She was below the age of 18, which is when half of all sexual assaults of women (or girls) occur, he said.

And she's outlined having the sort of mental health problems that often stick with survivors.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

So when someone like Sen. Orrin Hatch decides that Ford must be ""mistaken"" or ""mixed up,"" Kilpatrick points to the old adage ""where you stand depends on where you sit.""

Reactions like Hatch's are more political than anything else, he said. And suggesting that Ford's memories can't be trusted, the very memories she feared talking about for so many years, doesn't match what a lifetime of work has taught him."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180917095116-blasey-ford-kavanaugh-split-super-tease.jpg

It isn't always a police phone call and a rape kit; sometimes it's years of silence. Sometimes it trickles out, little by little, and then all at once; like a dam that swells and breaks and floods.

Part of it is fear: Will I be believed, these women and men think. Part of it is doubt, sown by social mores that seem eager to excuse the inexcusable: Was it something I should just accept?

When they do talk, sometimes years later, a question reflexively arises. It's a question that was posed, more or less, by the President of the United States , to a woman who alleges a current Supreme Court nominee held her down at a high school party and tried to assault her: Why didn't you speak up earlier?

In response, people on Twitter have been sharing their reasons for not speaking up about their own assaults.

They're afraid of repercussions

It's something victims grapple with a lot: the anguish and terror about retaliation. It's one reason that Christine Blasey Ford -- the woman who accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct -- said she kept silent for years

Sometimes, victims feel it's easier to keep it to themselves. The guilt, fear, shame and confusion is paralyzing,

f892d6794373421a95c602a55aa5bf83	['Elissa Strauss']	2018-09-20 00:00:00	Parents, stop feeling so guilty about TV time	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Parents, stop feeling so guilty about TV time	1	"(CNN) I've never met a parent at ease with the fact that their children watch television. This includes many, many lovely, curious and conscientious parents who allow their equally lovely, curious and conscientious children an American Academy of Pediatrics-approved one to seven hours a week of television and video games.

Their kids love it. And they, the parents, seem to find relief in the break it gives them.

Still, when the subject of TV comes up, they squirm. They stutter. Their cheeks turn red and their eyebrows cinch as they, so apologetically, explain why they need, really need, to turn on cartoons to cook dinner or catch their breath. In each of their minds lurks the specter of some other parent, be it a tech mogul or a supermom, whose children are living their best lives, blissfully, productively, screen-free.

Their defense of their children's screen time is not so much a confession but a concession to the better parent they'll never be.

Why? There's no evidence that children watching some television is a problem, and more often than not, it brings a sense of calm and even joy to the household. Even more strange: Most of us were raised in a time when ""screen time"" wasn't a concept, and our afternoons were spent engaged in ""Saved by the Bell."" Few if any of us attribute our neurosis or professional hiccups to this pastime. Why do we assume our children will fare any differently?

Where TV-related guilt comes from

For her recently published book "" The Art of Screen Time : How Your Family Can Balance Digital Media and Real Life,"" Anya Kamenetz, an education correspondent at NPR, pored over all the research on TV consumption and children and found that the majority of parents have nothing to worry about.

""We know that most kids who watch some TV are going to be fine,"" she said, adding that parents with children with behavioral disorders or who are on the autism spectrum might want to be extra careful.

The problem isn't television but what television can replace. If sitting in front of the TV gets in the way of physical activity and socializing, then yes, problems can arise. But a cartoon a day is not going to pave the way for weight problems, an inability to connect with others or an SAT disaster down the line.

Kamenetz explained that the culture shift around screen time is not the result of increased use. ""By the numbers, kids are not spending more times with screens than they were in the '80s,"" she said.

Instead, the shame and grief stem from the rise of a parenting culture, among better-educated and wealthier parents, that expects moms and dads (OK, mostly moms) to be intensely devoted to their carefully cultivated children. A cartoon represents a breach on both accounts: The parent is being lazy, and the child is not engaging in an activity that will bring them one step closer to an Ivy League education.

""We feel guilt putting our children in front of a screen because it is a violation of the premise that we are supposed to be constantly educating them,"" Kamenetz said.

TV has its benefits

Kamenetz suggests that parents should watch television with their children as often as possible. This allows the parents to discuss character motivations with their children and, in the process, try to cultivate empathy in them. Also, if parents are struggling to discuss a thorny subject with their children -- perhaps bullying or puberty -- watching a show about it together can open up the conversation.

""Humans have always used stories to help things make sense ... and deal with emotions,"" she said.

TV also gives parents a chance to better understand their children. For all of my life, I've viewed action films with a dismissive bewilderment. Immersing myself in a Manichaean world where the good guys always beat bad guys? Meh.

But then, at my older son's behest, I began watching children's action TV shows and films, and it started to make sense. While I'm still not likely to pay money to see Tom Cruise dangle out of a helicopter anytime soon, I understand the rush of power one might feel from seeing him do so. Seeing a good guy overcome all odds to get the bad guys creates a sense of power and moral clarity, two things my son aims to replicate in his pretend play. Thanks to multiple shared viewings of ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ninjago,"" I'm now more adept at joining in.

This social function of television doesn't just help the adult-child bond. It can also help kids relate to one another. Shared interest in TV shows and movies can help forge relationships and may make new, and scary, social situations easier for children.

""Fictional worlds can offer shared worlds to people who don't yet have anything in common,"" explained Jessica Black, a postdoctoral fellow in psychology at the University of Oklahoma who studies the relationship between narrative, morality and the imagination. She explained that this could be especially true for young children, for whom ""the line between fantasy and reality can be tenuous.""

My ""Ninjago""-loving son spent much of his first week of kindergarten seeking out children who know the show's story and characters and were willing to re-create them with him on the playground. Now, they've moved on to their own creations -- zombie tag is the current favorite -- but their shared in interest in ""Ninjago"" helped ease the transition.

Black said she grew up in a no-TV house and felt that she suffered socially for it while growing up.

""It's important for kids to find common ground with other kids when they go to school. When I was growing up, it was traumatizing when teachers would ask us about our favorite TV shows and I couldn't answer. I didn't want to put my kids through that,"" Black said.

She also pointed to research showing that television can give children a feeling of belonging and help them navigate thorny matters surrounding their racial and sexual identity. For younger children, educational shows like ""Sesame Street"" can improve their cognitive abilities

Not every moment of childhood has to be about optimization

But maybe all the above is missing the point. Maybe we shouldn't be focusing on the educational, social and emotional benefits of TV and should instead be OK with it because it is, quite simply, super fun.

""In modern parenting culture, it is hard to resist the temptation to moralize everything and have everything fit to brain enhancement,"" Kamenetz said. ""But TV is a fun part of growing up and a treat. Especially if you don't have it all the time.""

TV is a pleasure. There are compelling images, stories and sounds -- often of places we would never, or could never, step foot in. These worlds can be beautiful, and they can be funny. They also allow one's brain to, for a brief period, turn to a nice, calm mush.

Not everything we do needs to be in service of a higher purpose -- a better, shinier us. Sometimes it's OK to just sit and laugh or feel the thrill of watching the impossible. Sometimes the best part is the warm body coiled up beside you, creating a still intimacy that's hard to come by the rest of the day.

I have a visceral memory of this feeling from watching television as a child with my siblings, and I cherish it now when I watch television with my son. And when my younger son, now 1, is ready to join his brother on the couch, I will guiltlessly place him there, delighted they may experience these pleasures together.

8cbd06d829e14c18bc2259e00b88fc7d	['Ian Kerner']	2018-09-19 00:00:00	Low testosterone, or 'male menopause,' no longer just for older men	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Low testosterone, or 'male menopause,' no longer just for older men	1	"(CNN) In my practice, I've noticed that an increasing number of younger guys are complaining of sexual concerns, such as diminished libido and erectile problems, more commonly seen in older men.

Some clinicians believe that factors like obesity, stress and inadequate sleep probably play a role in such issues. This isn't purely a lifestyle issue; these factors are also possible causes of low levels of the hormone testosterone, which can influence sexual function.

""Low T"" is still most common in older men. Known as male menopause or andropause, this gradual decrease in testosterone typically occurs steadily over time. In fact, ""after age 40, men experience a 3% reduction in testosterone every year,"" naturopathic doctor Geovanni Espinosa said. ""After age 60, about 20% of men experience andropause.""

According to some estimates, the average 80-year-old man will have about 50% less testosterone than he did as a young guy. As a result, men may experience problems such as insomnia, weight gain, decreased muscle and bone density, anger and depression, as well as decreased libido and other sexual problems.

That said, low testosterone isn't necessarily just a consequence of aging. A number of factors can have an impact on a man's testosterone levels, as Espinosa writes as one of the contributors to the new book "" Integrative Sexual Health ,"" edited by Dr. Andrew Weil. The book notes that many factors influence sexual health, including mood, energy level, nutrition, genetics, age, health conditions and medications.

One option for low testosterone is prescription testosterone-replacement therapy, but this approach can have worrisome side effects, such as decreased sperm production and shrinkage of the testicles. ""Testosterone, like all hormones, has multiple actions on many body functions and on the mind,"" Weil said. ""In my opinion, it should be taken -- and prescribed -- only to correct a deficiency documented by appropriate blood tests.""

Otherwise, Weil recommends ""an integrative approach to sexual health"" that assesses all the many factors that affect testosterone.

Exercise

You may associate increased testosterone levels with athleticism, but not all physical activity is created equal.

Endurance cardio exercise, such as running marathons, actually lowers testosterone production. On the other hand, lifting weight using large muscles such as those in the legs and back can increase testosterone. ""Deadlifts and squats are excellent for this purpose,"" Espinosa said.

Nutrition

""Any diet that promotes obesity and insulin resistance will lower testosterone, because fat cells act like a sponge, soaking up testosterone and making it less freely available,"" explained Dr. Ronald Hoffman, who penned the book's chapter on diet and testosterone.

""For peak testosterone production, some carbs are necessary, but preferably the slowly metabolized kind from high-fiber fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes,"" Hoffman said.

When it comes to fat, research shows that saturated fats from such sources as grass-fed meats, coconut oil and macadamia nuts appear to support testosterone better than polyunsaturated fats from refined vegetable oils, he said.

Sleep and stress

Improved sleep hygiene is important for optimal levels of testosterone, most of which is produced during sleep between 5 and 7 a.m. Espinosa recommends shutting off your phone, tablet and other electronic devices after 8 or 9 p.m. because the blue light they emit can interfere with sleep.

Taking a warm shower, keeping your bedroom comfortable and setting the room temperature to about 70 degrees can also help improve sleep, as can practicing a relaxation technique such as deep breathing or meditation.

Supplements

Men who have been diagnosed with low testosterone should consider discussing certain supplements with their clinician, Espinosa said. He notes that vitamin D and zinc play important roles in the production of this hormone, while herbs such as ashwagandha and rhodiola may also be beneficial.

Not every sexual health concern can be traced back to low testosterone, but I think it's worth having yours tested if you think it might be affecting your sex life. In younger men, a normal testosterone level is considered to be between 270 and 1030 nanograms per deciliter.

Because most physicians don't check levels in young guys, most men can't be sure whether they are experiencing symptoms that can be directly correlated to low testosterone as they get older. That's why it may be worth getting a baseline done now, so you know what's normal for you."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180918160719-unhappy-stressed-man-stock-super-tease.jpg

(CNN) How exactly does one keep their brain and memory strong and healthy? This was one of the driving questions I had when I began the quest to improve my memory and become a four-time USA Memory Champion.

Researchers analyzed more than 900 yogurt brands found in UK supermarkets and found that only 9% can be classed as low in sugar -- containing less than five grams of sugar per 100 grams -- while just 2% of children's yogurts are low in sugar.

The study also warned of the ""health halo"" effect that leads consumers to automatically assume that organic products are healthier, despite this category of yogurt being the most sugary.

Organic yogurts contained an average of 13.1 grams of sugar per 100 grams, which is roughly equivalent to three sugar cubes, while children's yogurts averaged 10.8 grams. Greek and natural yogurts were the least sugary varieties, with an average of five grams per 100 grams.

Yoghurts marked as ""desserts"" contained the most sugar, with an average of 16.4 grams per 100 grams.

Eighteen people have become sick with E. coli illness linked to this meat. One of them died.

The recalled meat , which may be contaminated with E. coli, is from the chuck portion of the carcass and was produced June 21. The USDA inspection mark on the package says ""EST. 86R"" inside. The products have been distributed nationwide.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , illnesses have been reported in four states: Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts and Tennessee. The sick individuals began experiencing symptoms between July 5 and 25.

Symptoms of E. coli begin between one and 10 days after consuming contaminated food or drink, but most people become sick three to four days after exposure, the CDC says.

Symptoms can include diarrhea that is sometimes bloody, vomiting and fever. Most people recover after five to seven days. Some individuals, about 5 to 10%, develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome.

A recall of ground meat products from the same Colorado-based company was announced in August for ground meat products sold at Publix locations. At the time, the company reported E. coli illnesses but no deaths.

34c50fafa2994f59be1d46a83c32e0b6	['Michael Nedelman']	2018-09-18 00:00:00	Man loses hands and feet after dog-related infection	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Man loses hands and feet after dog-related infection	1	"(CNN) By the time Greg Manteufel, 48, reached the hospital in late June, ""my face was all red and blue, and it started going down the rest of my body,"" he said.

""My arms, my chest, everything was changing colors,"" said Manteufel, of West Bend, Wisconsin.

Manteufel initially thought he had a bad case of the flu, but in his blood, doctors discovered a type of bacteria normally found in the mouths of dogs and cats.

These bacteria rarely make humans sick, but Manteufel's infection -- and how his body responded -- caused surgeons to amputate parts of his nose and limbs, including both hands and feet.

""Just do whatever you have to do to save my life,"" Manteufel recalled telling his doctors at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee.

The type of bacterium, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, is ""completely normal flora of a dog's mouth and usually doesn't cause any sort of significant disease. However, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, in the wrong patient ... it can lead to severe infections -- but very, very rarely,"" said Dr. Stephen Cole , a lecturer in veterinary microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. Cole was not involved in Manteufel's care.

Fascinating, mysterious, and medically amazing case files. This series is the most interesting education into the world of medicine and disease and the human body.

When the bacteria spread to humans, they do so through bites, scratches or other close contact with dogs and cats, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In rare cases, patients like Manteufel can develop sepsis. They can also develop a complication, as he did, known as disseminated intravascular coagulation . In this disorder, small blood clots form rapidly and can then plug blood vessels and block normal circulation.

""The infection cleared fairly quickly"" with antibiotics, said Dr. Silvia Munoz-Price , an infectious disease physician who treated Manteufel at Froedtert Hospital. ""However, down the road, he developed poor circulation, poor blood flow into his arms and legs.

""And the blood flow was so low that he developed a process called gangrene. Basically, the tissue dies and becomes blue,"" said Munoz-Price, also an epidemiologist and a professor of medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin.

Doctors knew that they couldn't save his arms and legs. What they didn't know was how an otherwise healthy 48-year-old became infected in the first place.

Those at greatest risk are people with weakened immune systems , such as cancer patients and people who have had their spleens removed, according to the CDC.

""I've been basically [the] healthiest person in the world so far up to this point,"" Manteufel said. ""They said I could have hit the lottery five times in a row in one day before I should have gotten this bacteria in my body.""

Munoz-Price said, ""we are not certain how it ended up in his bloodstream"" and estimated that she sees only a small handful of cases a year.

However, she added that ""we are hypothesizing that it was because of a dog lick,"" because Manteufel had no obvious injuries and because he had been in contact with dogs, including his 8-year-old pit bull.

""We will probably never know,"" she said.

Should you be worried?

""I have a dog. Many people have dogs, and most of us will never have problems with infections related to our pets,"" Munoz-Price said.

Cole agreed: ""Every time your dog licks you, you may come into contact with this bacterium, but the vast, vast, vast majority of times, that causes absolutely no problem.""

Capnocytophaga bacteria have been detected in up to 74% of dogs, according to the CDC.

C. canimorsus is not on CDC's list of reportable diseases, and experts say it's hard to pin down numbers on how rare these infections are. A 2015 report found fewer than 500 laboratory-confirmed cases that had been reported since 1961, though the bacterium was not officially named as a new species until 1989.

Munoz-Price said that she sees aggressive infections like Manteufel's much more frequently caused by bacteria that already live in humans, not dogs or cats.

When it comes to our pets, Cole says, the benefits far outweigh the risks.

""We know that pets have wonderful health benefits in our life,"" he said. ""We know that they can make us happier, healthier people as long as we approach that in a safe way.""

That means practicing good hygiene with your pets, Cole said, including not letting pets lick open wounds or sores, washing hands and seeking proper medical attention for bite wounds.

""I would hate that anyone would think that this is a reason to give up their pet,"" he said.

'I'll always love dogs'

Manteufel still has a long road ahead. After more than a dozen surgeries, he's planning on getting prosthetic limbs, and doctors will use cartilage from other parts of his body to repair his nose.

He has also been working with rehab specialists learning to adjust to his new life. A GoFundMe page was also set up to help with costs.

Physical therapist Cheryl Vorwald helps Greg Manteufel with his rehabilitation at Froedtert Hospital.

Manteufel doesn't remember much about being sick -- ""I was kind of out of it,"" he said -- but since he went public with his story, others across the country have reached out with their own.

""We were amazed of even some people that came out that had this particular bacteria because it's been so rare, and we never heard of it,"" said his wife, Dawn. ""We found out there was two people in Wisconsin alone with the same situation.""

With his wife and son by his side, Manteufel is focused on staying positive.

""I have to be strong for them, and they're being strong for me,"" he said. ""I got to just keep looking forward and hope I get better every day.""

And he still has a soft spot for dogs, including his pit bull -- who he doesn't believe led to his infection. (She isn't much of a licker, he said.)

""I can't just stop liking dogs because this happened,"" he said. ""I'll always love dogs."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180917170042-01-infection-dog-capnocytophaga-super-tease.jpg

Kidney cancer is one of the 10 most common cancers in both men and women–and the most common type of kidney cancer is called renal cell carcinoma. If caught and treated early, the prognosis is good. But until recently, doctors had few good options to offer patients whose cancer spread despite treatment.

All that is changing. In recent years, a new class of immunotherapy drugs, “checkpoint inhibitors,” was approved to treat certain types of skin and lung cancer. Since then, those drugs have shown promise fighting a lot of different cancers, including renal cell carcinoma.

View transcript Dr. Arena: What immunotherapy is doing is unleashing the dogs. Dr. Sacher: Immunotherapy works by helping your body's own immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Dr. Arena: It's allowing your own body to take charge. Dr. Sacher: Your body's own immune system, as part of its natural function, recognizes abnormal cells and attempts to get rid of them. In a patient that has cancer, we frequently would see that their own immune cells were standing by and not really attacking cancer cells, even though cancer cells are the most abnormal cells you could find in someone's body. That, for a long time, really puzzled oncologists. Dr. Markman: Why is it that these cells are not helping to kill the cancer? They're there, but they're not doing anything. Well, perhaps it's not that the immune system isn't ready to go. It's not that the cells aren't there, but somehow they're blocked from working. Dr. Sacher: PD-L1 is a protein that is normally expressed on your body's cells in order to reduce inflammation, essentially a signal that your body's normal cells can use in order to say, ""I'm a normal cell. Don't attack me."" Cancer cells can co-opt that mechanism by expressing extremely high levels of that protein. Dr. Arena: And what it does is that these ligands will attach onto the activated killer T-cell as if it was a lock-and-key mechanism and turns off the motor. It stuns them. Dr. Sacher: Essentially, taking a normal mechanism that your body uses to regulate inflammation and use it as a shield against an anti-tumor immune response. Dr. Markman: The observation led to the development of a group of very exciting drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors. Dr. Arena: It almost sounds like something out of ""Star Wars."" It blocks that PD-L1 and PD-L2 from attaching into the activated T-cell, almost like sealing wax that would go over the key holder, let's say in your ignition of your car, so that your key could not get into that ignition key holder. Dr. Sacher: And allowing your body's own white blood cells to recognize, attack and ideally, eliminate cancer cells. So, they really serve to unmask a tumor and allow your body's immune cells to recognize it. Dr. Arena: It's saying, ""Hey, listen. We have a foreign body in our system. We are going to be on the attack."" Immunotherapy is much more subtle. It's allowing your own body to take charge. That is a totally new game. That is bringing everything into overtime.

Here’s what you need to know about immunotherapy and renal cell carcinoma.

1. What is immunotherapy?

Immunotherapy, put simply, enables the immune system to attack cancer cells. When you get a cold, your body’s immune system attacks (and eventually destroys) the foreign germs that are causing your cough and sniffles. That doesn’t happen when a person develops cancer, because cancer cells are masters of disguise; they use special proteins to convince the immune system that they are normal parts of the body, so the body’s natural defenses leave them alone.

Immunotherapy “unmasks” the cancer cells, so the body can attack and destroy them.

2. Has immunotherapy been used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma in the past?

Two types of immunotherapies, called interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha, are man-made proteins that stimulate the immune system. Doctors have used them to treat renal cell carcinoma for at least the last decade, but the drugs don’t help everyone. Only about 10 to 20% of those treated see their cancers shrink, and only some of those people experience remission.

These drugs have some serious side effects too, including fluid buildup in the lungs, kidney damage, heart attacks and intestinal bleeding, so they can only be given to people who are healthy enough to withstand the side effects.

Now that new types of immunotherapies are emerging, interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha are being used less frequently.

3. How do “checkpoint inhibitors” treat renal cell carcinoma?

“Checkpoint inhibitors” essentially cancel the off-switch that cancer cells use to shut down the immune system, so the body can begin attacking the cancer. In November 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nivolumab (Opdivo), a checkpoint inhibitor, to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma.

Right now, the drug is used to treat people whose cancer has gotten worse despite treatment with other medications. Unlike previous immunotherapy treatments, nivolumab is well-tolerated by most people. The most common side effects include fatigue, nausea, cough, itching, rash, loss of appetite, joint pain, constipation and diarrhea.

Nivolumab is given by intravenous (IV) infusion, usually every two weeks.

4. Does immunotherapy help people live longer with renal cell carcinoma?

In a head-to-head study that compared nivolumab with everolimus, a medication that is often used to treat people whose kidney cancer has progressed despite treatment, the patients who received the nivolumab lived more than five months longer than patients treated with the other medication. More people responded to immunotherapy treatment too; just over 21% of patients who received nivolumab responded, compared to fewer than 4% of those who received everolimus. Immunotherapy also seems to have a longer-lasting impact. The average sustained response–the amount of time the cancer remained under control–was almost two years for patients who received immunotherapy, versus just over a year for those who responded to everolimus."	https://d33ljpvc0tflz5.cloudfront.net/dims3/MMH/thumbnail/400x210>/quality/75/http://d26ua9paks4zq.cloudfront.net/03/d2/b8852fda4cfea833b2380705699a/resizes/500/image-gettyimages-160936360.jpg
713d8224c124407b917f9a4502bafbdb	['Susan Scutti']	2018-09-19 00:00:00	The 'dunce robots' of Japan will help children learn	https://www.cnn.com/	US	The 'dunce robots' of Japan will help children learn	1	"(CNN) For many people, the future inspires nightmare visions of a ""robopocalypse,"" a time when humans become subjugated by their own creations: robot overlords that possess superior physical and intellectual prowess.

One Japanese researcher, however, has designed a robot that instills the opposite image of our future, particularly in the minds of the children who use them.

Fumihide Tanaka's educational robots do not perform the role of an all-knowing teacher. Instead, they are built to help young students study English vocabulary and serve as classroom dunces who commonly make mistakes -- mistakes that a helpful student can correct.

Nao, a robot from Softbanks Robotics, can be programmed to work as an educational tool for children.

By teaching a less intelligent robot, children reinforce their own learning and so become stronger students themselves, Tanaka believes, and research supports this.

""We learn a lot by teaching others,"" said Tanaka, information and systems associate professor in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Tsukuba. ""I personally did not like the idea of tutor robots. This is the complete opposite of a tutor robot; it's more like the children's friend. Or like a younger brother or sister.""

'Care-giving robots'

Tanaka's creations fall into the category of ""care-receiving robots,"" he said. As the name suggests, they require human companions to pay attention and show concern. The original concept was proposed in 2009.

Having developed both entertainment and educational robots as a former research engineer at Sony, Tanaka believed that a care-receiving robot would be ideal as an educational tool.

In published research , he and a colleague wrote, ""Most educational robots for children so far have been designed and developed to play the role of human teachers or caregivers. In fact, some robots have already been named explicitly as 'childcare robots.' ""

But Tanaka and his colleagues aimed to turn the child care concept on its head.

They designed some of their original experiments around Nao, a SoftBank Robotics humanoid model that is just 25 inches high. When they presented the robot in a classroom of preschoolers, they found that when Nao was programmed to answer all the questions correctly, the children interacted less with their new friend than when it was programmed to make mistakes.

Not only did the robot inspire care-taking in the preschool children, it increased their spontaneous learning: the unplanned and unstructured eureka moments that can widen a child's worldview. For example, children enjoyed teaching the robot so much that they would repeat the teaching games at home, even though there was no robot there, their parents reported.

Since these early experiments, Tanaka has supervised the development of a commercial educational robot known as Pepper for SoftBank Robotics.

A different experience

In general, robots provide a different educational experience than previously experienced, said Tanaka, who has been working in this part of the robotics field since the early 2000s.

One advantage of educational robots is that they have no set timetable. ""Children can play with the robot at any time: at midnight or whenever he or she wants to play with the robot,"" he said. ""That's difficult to do with a human or adult teacher.""

Another benefit is that robots are entertaining while holding a child's interest for sustained periods, studies have found, and this provides motivation to learn , he added.

On top of that, a well-designed robot will not make a child feel "" pressured ,"" Tanaka said, whereas parents and teachers sometimes do. ""We can design a robot as a kind of weak existence."" Reassured by the robot's unimposing presence, a child will want to play and be able to learn easily instead of feeling the kind of pressure that locks a student's mind

The subtleties of demeanor and behavior are inherent in designing ""social robots,"" the broader group of robots of which Tanaka's care-receiving robots are a part.

'Social robots'

Joseph Michaelis, a doctoral student in the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, explained that social robots ""interact with humans using natural social cues like gestures, tone of voice, or head and eye movements to convey meaning.""

""Since humans are so strongly wired to interpret what they encounter in a social way, even simple actions, such as when a robot makes a small movement after a child presses its button, can be perceived as social,"" he said.

Michaelis and his colleagues designed a learning companion robot , Minnie, based on principles of social robot design described in a paper published in 2017 . Unlike Tanaka's robots, though, Minnie does not require a child's care.

Minnie, a learning companion robot, listens and makes occasional comments while children read.

Instead, Michaelis' team programmed Minnie, who is just 13½ inches high, to respond with thoughtful comments to individual children who read books. ""The interaction with the robot and comments that Minnie makes about the books demonstrate some understanding of what is happening in a story but is not presented in an authoritative way,"" Michaelis said.

For example, when a child reads a frightening scene to Minnie, the robot might comment, ""Oh, wow, I'm really scared,"" as if it had a real personality.

Minnie also makes eye contact with the child, averts its gaze when speaking (so as to appear thoughtful) and moves subtly in idle moments to appear more lifelike.

""We want the children to feel they are working together with a peer rather than being taught by a tutor or teacher, and so we design the interaction to be conversational,"" Michaelis said.

The hope, as with Tanaka's robots, is that Minnie can help kids feel greater motivation and ultimately greater autonomy so they will want to learn on their own.

However, Minnie is still in the experimental phase. Michaelis believes that ""general-purpose educational robots are a very long way from reality."" First, he speculates, well-designed -- if limited -- intelligence robots will be introduced into the educational system.

But before that, there are more than a few hurdles to overcome, he said.

Pepper, a Softbank Robotics creation, has been used for commercial applicatons, including acting as a ""greeter"" in stores.

Parental concerns

According to Tanaka, one of the first questions parents ask is whether the robot poses any safety concerns for their children.

For this reason, he designs his care-receiving robots to be smaller than the children and to appear ""weak"" and ""not harmful. I thought that this is more socially acceptable."" Appearance is important, he said, though it's unclear how designers can ensure that robots do not frighten young children.

Michaelis noted that ""privacy is a huge concern, particularly for parents.""

""Parents want to know what information the robot is collecting, how it uses it and when this information is being collected,"" he said. ""In our work, we told parents and children that the robot would audio record their reading.""

To ease parents' minds, Michaelis and his colleagues added a simple LED to indicate to families when the robot was recording. ""It is also important to keep in mind that social norms about privacy are different from culture to culture, and the design of a social robot should be sensitive to this,"" he said.

Replacing teachers?

The greatest worry for both society and robot engineers, though, is ethical: ""Tutor robots tend to be regarded as replacing the human teachers,"" Tanaka said.

The fear of losing jobs is real, since robots have reduced the number of employees in other fields, such as auto manufacturing, Michaelis said.

""However, most people in educational robotics, including Fumihide Tanaka, don't see robots replacing teachers, not even in the long term, but rather as a way of supporting teachers and supplementing curriculum,"" Michaelis said. ""This support might be especially crucial given the ever-expanding size of classrooms, at least in the US.""

Japan is also looking for new ways to establish an improved system of education.

A recent statement from the Central Council for Education, a body within the Ministry of Education, suggests that it is ""becoming increasingly difficult to teach children."" Child poverty, an increasing number of both special-needs students and foreign students, and ""bullying, truancy and acts of violence"" all contribute to educational challenges, according to a council report -- challenges that could be overcome by robotic aids.

In April, Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology will launch a robot initiative on a trial basis at about 500 schools nationwide, as reported by Japan Times. The goal of the initiative: helping children learn English. Tanaka has not been directly involved in the initiative, but this and all other real-world tests of robotic educational theory will inevitably inform future research.

The next trend and an area researchers around the world have begun to explore is group learning, Tanaka said. ""So far -- and this is not only in Japan -- most researchers for educational robots target the one-to-one learning scenario,"" he said. He, and other researchers globally, are also investigating the ways in which telepresence robots, which can be controlled from a distant location, can be used in classrooms.

""We ask elderly people in Japan to teach children in elementary school. By using this robot, elderly people can participate in the classroom from their homes,"" Tanaka said, suggesting that this use of robots may enrich both classrooms and the lives of older adults. ""So distance learning is another project we are working on now.""

Michaelis said he's ""very optimistic"" about the role that robots can play in education. ""If we get it right,"" he said, ""educational robots might have the transformational power that personal computers and even calculators had on education."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180917153628-minnie-japan-educational-robots-super-tease.jpg

It was 2015, and Brittany bought heroin from Ryan in a parking lot, and Ryan cheated her. Brittany called him some choice names, and Ryan shrugged his shoulders and walked off.

Despite that inauspicious beginning, and the many years of drug abuse that preceded it, the Colemans want to get out this message: There is life and love after drug addiction.

They want to give hope to those whose lives have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic , which kills more than 115 people every day in the United States.

""You just have to find the right people to get connected to to kind of show you the way out,"" said Brittany, 29.

Addiction, rehab and relapse

When Brittany Hokrein was 11 years old, her parents divorced, and she and her brothers and mother moved from Georgia to Pennsylvania.

She struggled emotionally, and at age 14 she started to use marijuana and alcohol so she wouldn't feel the hurt. Soon, pain pills became her drug of choice, and by age 18 she was addicted.

Ryan, now 37, was born into a military family, moving from Georgia to Germany to Texas and then back to Georgia. Like Brittany, he had a loving family, but as a teenager, he felt like he didn't fit in, and he started to smoke pot at age 14.

""I found that I could medicate that feeling. Life was great once I got high,"" he said.

By the time Ryan was 17, he was smoking pot every day, and he dropped out of high school senior year. He moved on to LSD and cocaine. By the time he was 20 he was hooked on painkillers.

His father, an Army drill sergeant, and his mother, a high school teacher, begged him to go to recovery. They told him a recovery program had saved his mother from alcoholism when Ryan was a child. But he rebelled and rejected everything his parents stood for.

By 22, he was strung out on heroin. ""I had to have it,"" he said.

Over the next 10 years, Brittany and Ryan unknowingly led parallel lives. Hopping from city to city, they both used heroin, methamphetamines, prescription opioids, Xanax, cocaine and alcohol.

Brittany overdosed three times, and Ryan overdosed five times. Ryan got arrested 16 times, mostly for stealing so he could get money to buy drugs. Brittany stole, too, and had a stint at prostitution.

Their parents loved them and helped get them into rehab programs. Each stint ended in a relapse.

By 2016, both Ryan and Brittany had moved back to Augusta, Georgia.

They happened to end up at the same recovery group meeting. Eight months had passed since they'd met at that drug deal in the parking lot.

A forbidden love (and with good reason)

He's cute, Brittany thought when she met him again at rehab.

She's beautiful, Ryan thought. Really beautiful. And she looked so familiar.

He realized she was the woman he'd cheated in the drug deal.

""I thought, 'This was fate.' I walked right up to her and told her I needed to apologize for ripping her off,"" Ryan remembered. ""I did want to make amends, but I also had an ulterior moment. I wanted to date her.""

Dating was discouraged in their recovery program -- and Brittany and Ryan found out why.

As they fell in love, they spent all their time together and their lives became intertwined. At first they both stayed sober but then slowly, imperceptibly, Ryan slipped away, taking Brittany with him.

After about four months of dating, one Friday morning Ryan told Brittany he was going down to a park by the Savannah River to think about his life.

But instead, he drove two hours to Atlanta to buy heroin and cocaine.

He called her on the way and told her the truth. Brittany stood there with her phone in her hand. She wrote out a text that she knew she shouldn't send.

It said that Ryan needed to bring back some drugs for her. She stared at the text for a while. Then she hit send.

And everything fell apart.

Giving up heroin -- and each other

For the next week, Brittany and Ryan went right back to heroin, right back to cocaine, right back to meth, sometimes all at the same time.

""I even romanticized it, saying f*** all the rules, we're going to be heroin junkies together, all that 'Trainspotting' bull****,"" he said, referring to the 1996 film about young Britons on heroin. ""Addicts have a sick way of romanticizing their drug use.""

Then on October 3, 2016, they both overdosed on meth and heroin. Medics found Brittany lying on the floor of a gas station bathroom, and Ryan right outside, unconscious in his car.

The medics gave them doses of Narcan, the drug that reverses overdoses. Brittany had done so much heroin she needed two doses.

Ryan was wracked with guilt. He felt personally responsible for Brittany's near death in that gas station bathroom. He was the one who'd driven to Atlanta to get drugs when they were both working so hard to be clean. He was the one who said 'yes' when she asked him to bring some back for her.

""I had almost killed the person I loved the most,"" he said.

Brittany returned to Hope House, a treatment center for women in Augusta.

Ryan visited here there. Surrounded by his sponsor from his recovery group and Brittany's counselors, he got down on his knees -- and apologized.

""He held my hand and apologized to me in front of all those people,"" Brittany said, crying at the memory of it. ""He was shaking and I was shaking. He said how sorry he was for putting me through all this and how scared he was to almost lose me.""

They then had to do something they describe as just as hard as giving up heroin: They had to give each other up. For a month, they had no contact at all.

""The only way for us to survive was to focus only on our recovery, and not on each other,"" Brittany said. ""It was the only way it would work.""

Brittany then left Hope House, and the two met up at their recovery group's Thanksgiving dinner. They started back dating slowly, and then a year and a half later, on February 24, 2018, they were married.

Two years sober

Next month marks two years of sobriety for both Brittany and Ryan, and today they live in a small house with four cats in Augusta. Ryan works at a vape store, where he's advanced from part-time clerk to assistant manager to manager. Brittany works at a rehab center, helping others overcome their addictions.

They volunteer to help others in recovery and have also spoken at programs that train people how to use Narcan, the drug that saved both of them so many times.

When asked how they survived addiction where so many have died, they say it was the grace of God and to a large degree luck -- luck that those Narcan doses were available right when they needed them.

They also say they let other people guide them: their families, who never gave up on them; the rehab counselors who stuck with them; and their recovery mentors who showed them the way, including that they needed to focus on their individual recoveries and not on each other in order to survive.

All of those people joined them on their wedding day.

""It was really a culmination of all the good things going on in our lives finally really coming together,"" Ryan said.

Sometimes Brittany can't believe she's alive, much less in a loving, stable relationship.

""It's unbelievable. I don't think that I would have ever imagined that I would be married and happy and just planning a future with another human,"" she said. ""I didn't ever picture that for myself.""

They want people in the throes of addiction to see that despite the dire statistics, there can be hope.

""I want them to see people like us and realize that we were in that same place at one point in our lives -- and we got out,"" Ryan said."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180911103211-opioid-romance-1-super-tease.jpg
34c008367906440ab4bd52eef7936ee2	['Jessica Ravitz']	2018-09-03 00:00:00	Claire Wineland, inspirational speaker and social media star, dies one week after lung transplant	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Claire Wineland, inspirational speaker and social media star, dies one week after lung transplant	1	"No matter the obstacles placed in front of her, of which there were many, she refused to be pitied and was determined to live a life that mattered. She inspired countless people, invited -- no, demanded -- honest talk about illness and mortality, and brightened the worlds of those she touched with her smile, spunk and spirit.

On Sunday evening, after being taken off life support and using the newly transplanted lungs she received just one week earlier, Claire took her last breath. The cause of death was a massive stroke she suffered soon after the transplant surgery. She was 21.

'Love what is'

A quarter of Claire's life was spent in the hospital. The medical team that tended to her became family. She played hide-and-seek with nurses and left explosions of glitter in her wake. She watched one of her doctors squirm as he gave her the safe-sex talk. She took great care to decorate her hospital room so it felt and looked like home.

Her parents, Melissa Nordquist Yeager and John Wineland, split up when Claire was 3, but they remained friends and partners in her care.

Her father credits Claire with teaching him ""to not be afraid of what hasn't happened yet"" and to learn to ""love what is.""

Yeager, who lost and quit jobs as hospital stays dictated, always marveled at her daughter's aura and her ability to lift up those around her.

In 2017, Yeager recalled a conversation with Claire about death. At one point, Claire looked at her mom and said, ""After you die, you're closer to everyone you love because you're part of everything,"" Yeager remembered.

These words were a gift, a reminder that Claire would remain with her always, even after she was gone.

Trusting Claire

More than 30,000 people in the United States, more than 70,000 worldwide, have cystic fibrosis, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation . The median survival age is 40, the foundation reports, which is a great improvement from the 1950s, when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare.

Claire Wineland spent a quarter of her life in the hospital.

The genetic and progressive disease creates an overabundance of mucus, which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs. It also complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, eventually, leads to respiratory failure.

There is no cure, but dutiful breathing treatments -- which eat up hours each day -- can help with symptoms and complications. A double-lung transplant, when successful, can add years to a patient's life.

Claire's parents learned to trust their independent and strong-willed daughter. When it came to her care, she knew her body best -- what worked for her, what didn't and how far she was willing to go.

So when she became a legal adult and told them she had no intention of getting a double-lung transplant, they had to accept her decision, even if it pained them.

""I had to be honest,"" she once explained. ""It's not for me and never has been.""

A change of heart

Claire took the gift of life and her health seriously, but she didn't take herself too seriously. She once escaped from the hospital so she could attend a Bernie Sanders rally. She laughed at the absurdities that often swirled around her, including those moments in the produce aisle at Whole Foods when shoppers would prescribe her unsolicited ""cures,"" telling her to eat more pineapple or that a mushroom cleanse would take care of everything.

Claire Wineland's greatest wish, her mother said, was that ""her foundation will live on, even in her absence.""

She was of the mind that she would leave this world with the body she came in with. She'd travel, answer calls for speaking engagements and put energy into her foundation , which she set up at age 13 after coming out of a 16-day medically induced coma. She'd work on a book -- promising it wouldn't be ""another happy sick person book"" -- and appreciate the small things like swims in the ocean for as long as she was able.

At a TEDx talk she gave last year, Claire made a point of saying how cystic fibrosis helped give her a quality of life.

""Life isn't just about being happy. ... It's not about how you feel second to second,"" she said. ""It's about what you're making of your life and whether you can find a deep pride in who you are and what you've given.""

Claire had a change of heart about transplant earlier this year, prompted by a steep decline in her health that robbed her of the energy and ability to do what gave her joy and purpose. She wasn't done contributing. It was a welcome, albeit terrifying, development for those who loved her.

To get on the list for new lungs, she had to be sick enough to need them, yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery. Some people worried that she'd waited too long and wouldn't be given the chance at continued life.

But Claire took on the evaluation process to get on the list with laser focus. She sat in an educational meeting at UC San Diego Health's transplant center and diligently took notes.

Revealed on her left ankle was a tattoo: the thumbs-up ""Don't Panic"" logo from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""

She listened to the risks and the long list of side effects and emerged unfazed.

""None of it spooked me,"" Claire said afterward. ""Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do ... I'm willing to deal with anything.""

'It's a GO!!!'

In late May, she made the list and shared the exciting news with her social media followers who dot the globe. But then, a mix of health and life complications took a toll and knocked her off the list, temporarily. By mid-August, she was back on and feeling ready.

Claire and her mother beamed in a photo posted on social media after they learned her transplant was a go.

She'd worked hard to get there, was focused on her self-care and getting stronger. She joked that the squats she was doing, upon doctor's orders, would help get her more than lungs. She'd also get a butt.

She knew that the call could come at any minute, and on August 26, it did.

""It's a GO!!!"" she posted on Twitter, not long before she was wheeled into the operating room in San Diego. ""See y'all on [the] other side.""

The nine-hour surgery went well, and her mother reported that the lungs were working great. Yeager posted a video of herself doing a happy dance with friends in the waiting room.

But not long after the successful surgery, hope turned to fear. Claire suffered a stroke when a blood clot cut off blood flow to the right side of her brain. She never emerged from her medically induced coma. Despite emergency surgeries, and what her mother described as ""Herculean efforts"" to try to save her, the daughter she knew was gone. Given the severity of the stroke and Claire's advance directive, it became clear that it was time to let her go. She passed away peacefully, with her parents by her side.

""They saw her into this world for her first breath and were with her for her last,"" Laura McHolm, the board chair for Claire's foundation, wrote in a Facebook post.

Less than 3% of lung transplant recipients have a stroke between the surgery and hospital discharge, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing , which operates the nation's organ transplant system.

Claire, who understood the importance of organ donation, was a donor herself. On Monday afternoon, her mother received word that Claire had already made a difference.

""Claire was able to save the life of two people, her right kidney was transplanted to a 44 year old woman in San Diego, and her left kidney was transplanted to a 55 year old male in Northern California. Also, Claire's corneas and tissue was recovered and she will be able to enhance the life of up to 50 people,"" a family services specialist wrote to Yeager in an email message. ""Claire's gift is huge, I want your family to know that your daughter is a hero.""

The family intends to honor her memory by continuing to advance Claire's Place Foundation , which she established to financially support others affected by her lifelong disease.

'Go enjoy it'

In one of the last videos Claire posted, she went where she hadn't before.

A self-described ""goofball,"" she usually engaged people with humor and optimism. This time, she was raw and allowed herself to cry. As she faced the prospect of getting a double-lung transplant, she understood how desperate she was to live -- and give -- more.

""It hurts everything inside of me to make this video,"" she said into the camera. ""I didn't realize how much I didn't expect to live this long. I didn't expect to have a chance. ... The years of telling myself I can do it on my own are over.""

She had plenty of emotional support, but she worried what transplant surgery might mean for her future and her parents' future if it didn't go well. What if they poured everything into her transplant, and she didn't make it or was not able to work again, she explained later. She needed financial help. By asking for it, she said, she could relax and get in the headspace for whatever would come next.

Before signing off, Claire implored viewers to do one thing.

""Go enjoy your life. Really. I mean that seriously,"" she said with her signature smile and laugh, her eyes not yet dry. ""Go enjoy it, 'cause there are people fighting like hell for it."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180823192013-01-claire-wineland-headshot-super-tease.jpg
deabe15721634c1894978414492634ec	['Leonie Erasmus']	2018-08-29 00:00:00	Slow down and live long with the ancient practice of qigong	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Slow down and live long with the ancient practice of qigong	1	"Hong Kong (CNN) Among the skyscrapers of Hong Kong, eight senior citizens gather at the Happy Valley Recreation grounds in the Wan Chai district. It's time for their weekly class in qigong, an ancient Chinese mind-body practice similar to tai chi.

It's summer on the island, and at 8:30 in the morning, the temperature is already 80 degrees Fahrenheit, with an unforgiving level of humidity.

But the hot weather does not deter qigong Master Joe Lok's students; they believe wholeheartedly in the positive effects the practice has on their health.

The word qigong is a combination of ""qi,"" meaning energy, and ""gong,"" which loosely translates as an accomplishment or practice, explained Lok, who has been practicing qigong for nearly 30 years.

It is the accomplishment or practice of energy and involves becoming aware of your breathing, sensing the energy within you and then following a series of slow, coordinated movements.

Movement, meditation and controlled breathing are the staples of every qigong session, with the ultimate focus being holistic well-being.

Lok explains that ""in order to do qigong ... we have to be pretend to be empty, so the first thing to empty is the mind, so we try not to think of anything and only listen to our breathing, relax all the strength and relax the mind, so it's some kind of meditation.""

Meditation has been shown to improve stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Experts believe it goes hand-in-hand with healthy habits that can improve our longevity.

As a result, qigong itself is a health practice, Lok said.

Feeling the energy

For Lok, it is vital that all his students experience ""qi"" before they begin any movements. He practices Taoist qigong, which has a strong connection with nature, he explained. In his class, he says that you can start to experience the ""qi"" by simply holding a specific posture.

Your feet should be between hip and shoulder distance apart and your toes turned out slightly. From here, Lok encourages you to breathe deeply and straighten the curve in your lower spine by moving your hips slightly forward. With your hands hanging loosely, relax your body so you don't feel any pressure or tension on your joints.

Lok directs his students to focus and straighten their fingertips slightly with their hands in front of their stomachs and pointing at an angle down to the ground.

Students find 'Qi' by placing their hands in front of their stomachs and pointing them at an angle down to the ground.

He then asks his students whether they can sense ""qi""-- a warm feeling or feeling of life in their fingertips, often causing a tingling sensation. Once his students all feel the it, the movement routine can begin.

He warns that you can easily wave your hands around without really experiencing ""qi,"" and that would completely defeat the purpose of his practice.

The goal of the movement is to clear blockages, release pain and refresh the body and mind.

Slow and steady

The movements in qigong are very slow. Students raise their arms over their heads, rotate their wrists, lower their arms and then make circular motions with their hands. Lok says that ""as soon as you get into it, the qi begins to flow.""

Emotions are also calmed, and people tend to live happier, Lok believes.

One student slowly works through the Qigong movements.

In a day and age when wellness is prioritized and dozens of wellness practices sprout daily, with elements of the ancient practice of qigong forming the basis for many of them and studies highlighting the benefits.

Removing the mystery

Cecilia Chan, chair of the Department of Social Work and Social Administration at the University of Hong Kong, has been studying the effects of qigong for years. Her aim is simple: to demystify the seemingly inexplicable benefits.

There are a lot of ""misconceptions about qigong,"" said Chan, whose team studies internal qigong, or exercise qigong -- a simple set of movements in which no energy is given to participants through a qigong master; instead, the participants use their own energy to do the movements, similar to other movement practices, like yoga.

They do not explore external qigong, in which many believe that a qigong master can give you healing energy through hand gestures.

Chan believes that qigong can be beneficial to health, especially for those with chronic fatigue syndrome.

Her team conducted studies on women with chronic fatigue in 2012, concluding that qigong ""may improve chronic fatigue symptoms and mental functioning.""

They conducted another study in 2017 to explore whether qigong can reduce depression among women with chronic fatigue. ""From our study, we found that a lot of people after practicing qigong ... become more positive,"" Chan said. ""They become less indulged in their suffering, and they leave the victim's role more readily.""

She likens qigong to other mind-body practices like yoga and adds that it ""teaches a philosophy of letting go,"" helping those who practice it to embrace a ""philosophy of let it be ... and be happy with yourself.""

Researchers at Harvard University have also been exploring the heath aspects of qigong, with their research finding that its practice can help with motor function and depression for individuals with Parkinson's disease.

Lok, however, needs no convincing that qigong works on many levels. He witnesses the healing benefits all around him in class. ""There's evidence everywhere that it benefits life in general,"" he said. ""If you have a little time, try qigong. Perhaps you will see the miracle in the qigong, but if you don't try it, there's no chance. ... Find a teacher near you or otherwise go online and start doing something. It's very easy, and the benefit is ever so great."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180829094158-03-qigong-super-tease.jpg
429b11c0704b45e7804c534e2fc9fc60	['Wayne Drash', 'Cnn Photographs Victor J. Blue For Cnn']	2018-08-23 00:00:00	From 'screw you' Aetna to Sweet 16, teen celebrates her surgery -- and new life	https://www.cnn.com/	US	From 'screw you' Aetna to Sweet 16, teen celebrates her surgery -- and new life	1	"Nyack, New York (CNN) Cara Pressman raises her hands in triumph. The crowd claps in unison, and a DJ cranks up the music. The banquet hall on the banks of the Hudson pulsates as nine of Cara's best friends lead a procession to the dance floor.

It's the start of her Sweet 16 birthday party -- a celebration not just of her big day but of all that has happened in the past year. A way for friends and family to express their love.

Cara became a viral sensation months ago after the teen with a seizure disorder delivered a blunt message to her insurer. Her two words for Aetna -- ""screw you"" -- expressed the anger she felt at being denied a minimally invasive brain surgery that promised to end her seizures.

Her story, first told by CNN in December , triggered a massive uproar, and Aetna eventually approved the procedure.

This Saturday evening, amid the cheers of her closest friends, Cara radiates on stage beneath strings of white flashing lights. Then someone shouts, and the dance floor clears. Everyone rushes outside.

It's as if Mother Nature has joined the party: A rainbow stretches from the Hudson River high into the heavens.

Cara launches her head back and strikes an array of poses as people take photos.

""That's what's important in life -- miracles, right?"" her mother, Julie Pressman, says, pointing to the sky. ""I can finally exhale.""

Her father, Rob, says it's ""like a unicorn coming down.""

""She's been so happy since the operation,"" he says. ""We're looking forward to a great year.""

It's a moment the family thought might never come.

After Cara speaks, Aetna changes policy

Cara's mother became a fierce champion for her youngest daughter, determined that Cara would get the surgery her doctors believed could stop her seizures.

A motivational note rests on the family refrigerator. Cara has suffered from a seizure disorder most of her life.

Each time they struck, her body would grow cold and shake. She'd zone out anywhere from 20 seconds to two minutes, typically still aware of what was going on around her. She had seizures on the soccer field, during softball games, on stage during plays, in the classroom. Most anywhere.

Her doctors last year recommended Cara for laser ablation surgery, a minimally invasive procedure in which a thin laser is used to heat and destroy lesions in the brain where the seizures originate.

It's cutting-edge work, performed through an eighth-inch hole in the skull. Neurosurgeons believe it to be more precise and less invasive than traditional open brain surgery, in which a two-inch hole is cut in the skull or, in some cases, the entire skull cap is removed.

Yet the nation's third-largest insurance company overruled her treating physicians. In denying her coverage, Aetna said it considered laser ablation surgery ""experimental and investigational for the treatment of epilepsy because the effectiveness of this approach has not been established.""

""Clinical studies have not proven that this procedures [sic] effective for treatment of the member's condition,"" Aetna said.

When first approached for comment by CNN late last year, the insurance giant stood by its denial.

Cara underwent the laser ablation surgery on July 25. Three weeks later, she says she's adjusting well: ""It kind of feels like it's a little bit of a dream, but I also know it's real.""

In response, Cara had this message : ""Considering they're denying me getting surgery and stopping this thing that's wrong with my brain, I would probably just say, 'screw you.' ""

From there, the story took off. The hashtags #ScrewAetna and #CaraPressman were shared across Twitter. Her grandmother made T-shirts for family members for Christmas that read ""I'm on Cara's team"" on the front; on the back, the message said #SYA (short for #ScrewYouAetna ).

Girl has blunt message for Aetna after her brain surgery request was deniedhttps://t.co/QMmPf2i4t0 — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) December 11, 2017

Behind the scenes, neurologists and neurosurgeons reached out to the family, offering support. But none was more powerful than Mark Solazzo, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Northwell Health , New York's largest health care provider.

The hospital executive was so moved by Cara's story he told the family: ""This is the last day you're going to fight Aetna on your own.""

Solazzo is passionate on this issue: Insurance denials for what Northwell deems medically necessary procedures have swelled the past two years, with the health provider saying it lost $150 million in justifiable reimbursements at a time when insurance companies have been setting record profits.

The Northwell executive set in motion a chain of events. He tapped Dr. Ashesh Dinesh Mehta, the director of Northwell's epilepsy surgery, to handle Cara's case and even offered the surgery for free if Aetna still refused to cover it.

""I was happy to do that,"" Mehta said.

Before her Sweet 16 party, Cara spent the day getting her hair and makeup done.

Cara underwent a series of tests this spring with her new team at Northwell. Mehta said her case was complex because the focal point of her seizures was fairly deep in her brain behind her temple. To perform an open brain surgery, he said, he would need to dissect a portion of her brain to get to the spot.

As a result, Mehta said, her team agreed with her previous doctors that laser ablation was the route to go.

""We did our due diligence, and we did determine that this would be the best way to treat her epilepsy,"" he told CNN.

Along the way, Aetna had a change of heart. In April, the insurer notified the family it would cover the surgery: ""Coverage for this service has been approved, subject to the requirements in this letter.""

There was no explanation. No apology. Just an approval with full coverage.

Pressed by CNN for answers, Aetna said the approval came after her doctors made a new request for laser ablation surgery. ""Based on recently published clinical evidence, the procedure was approved.""

Aetna went on to say it recently updated its policies for epilepsy patients seeking laser ablation. ""Related, in July 2018 we made updates to our epilepsy surgery clinical policies based on recently-published data,"" Aetna said. ""The new guidelines cover laser ablation surgery if certain criteria are met.

""As shared in December, we constantly evaluate new published and peer-reviewed studies as well as additional evidence when developing our clinical policies, and will continue to do so.""

Cara's mother, Julie, wanted the party to be especially memorable: ""It's not just a birthday party. It's literally like a debut. She's coming out of this brain surgery and is so radically different.""

Mehta gave all the credit to the diminutive teen with the powerful voice: ""She really advocated for herself, and it worked out for her. Whatever happened, it got her the appropriate treatment. I've got to hand it to her.""

Northwell's Solazzo added, ""Cara has been an inspiration to all those who have had the privilege of caring for her. Her advocacy and courage will hopefully clear the way for other epilepsy patients who could benefit from this surgery.""

'Never been more excited'

The day of the surgery, July 25, was filled with nerves and excitement. Cara's parents and older sister, Lindsey, crowded her hospital room before the operation. They gabbed about trivial, everyday stuff, as families often do.

But make no mistake. The importance of the day weighed on everyone.

Cara told staff at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset she had ""never been more excited for anything in my life."" Her first grand mal seizure, when she fell to the floor and shook, came at the age of 9, but she remembers having smaller aura seizures, when she would space out for brief spells, as far back as kindergarten. She can have five seizures in a day, sometimes as many as 30.

""It's been really, really difficult to live with,"" she said.

Cara keeps a box filled with various anti-seizure medications from over the years. About 1/3 of epilepsy patients live with uncontrollable seizures because no available treatment works for them, according to the Epilepsy Foundation.

As she was wheeled off to the operating room, Dad wrapped his arms around Lindsey and held her, reassuring her that Cara would be OK.

Cara had waited until summer to undergo the surgery. That way, she could adjust to any changes in her brain activity before the new school year started.

Laser ablation is still emerging in the care of epilepsy patients, and Cara's mother said she hopes her daughter can serve as an example for other teens who qualify for laser surgery and are afraid of open brain surgery, known as a temporal lobectomy.

""This really gives people hope who are young and dealing with this -- that they can go forward early on in life and get this procedure done,"" she says.

In the operating room, the hourlong procedure ""went quite well,"" Mehta said. ""Everything went as planned.""

There are only about 40 to 50 centers around the nation, Mehta said, where laser ablation surgeries are performed, with the technique becoming more popular in recent years. Mehta said existing data show about a 50% seizure-free rate for those who undergo laser ablation, compared to about 70% who undergo traditional open brain surgeries.

A comprehensive study is underway to better define its efficacy. But Mehta said he has had better success than the national average: ""My results are about as good as the open temporal lobectomy.""

The laser surgery is more appealing to patients and parents, he says, because open surgery can be so daunting. Laser surgery is less invasive, requires less time in the hospital and has a quicker recovery, Mehta said.

Cara poses for pictures outside the banquet hall at Nyack Beach State Park as friends snap photos. ""You look like a princess,"" one friend says.

Patients can suffer short-term memory loss, especially forgetting names of people they meet. ""It's not usually something that is devastating, especially when you're younger,"" he says. ""Given that she's young, we believe that her brain is going to be more able to adapt.""

Cara had one grand mal seizure in the days after the surgery, but she'd forgotten to take her anti-seizure medicine the day before. Mehta also says it's not unusual for patients to have seizures in the week or two right after surgery.

Based on her recovery three weeks after surgery, he believes Cara has a 60% to 80% chance of being seizure-free. The benchmark will be a year from now. ""The big question is whether she will have one or two seizures a year or whether she has no seizures,"" Mehta says. ""We want no seizures.

""I'm keeping my fingers crossed.""

A new, vibrant Cara

At her birthday party, the new Cara is on full display. She dances. She laughs. She commands the crowd.

Cara's father, Robert, requested a slow dance with his daughter shortly after she blew out the candles on her birthday cake. ""Since the operation,"" he says, ""she has exploded -- just the joy in her personality.""

Her sister marvels at her transformation. ""She is just flourishing,"" Lindsey says. ""I've never seen her so vibrant and so open with herself.""

Cara says it's been ""weird"" ever since her surgery because ""I feel so much better."" It's also a bit of an adjustment to think she could actually be seizure-free.

""It kind of feels like it's a little bit of a dream, but I also know it's real.""

On stage, Cara honors 16 of the closest people in her life, and each helps light an individual candle. She begins with her father: ""One of the funniest people I know.""

There's the uncle who is ""one of the biggest weirdos I know,"" the friend who ""always knows when to cheer me up"" and the one who ""always has a smile on her face that never seems to leave.""

She saves the 16th candle for her mom. Cara praises her as a triathlete and marathon runner, and thanks her for planning the entire party.

""She was there for me every single time I was in the hospital -- literally the best,"" Cara says. ""Mom, please come up and light the final candle!""

Cara says she hopes she can inspire other teens with seizure disorders to advocate for themselves. ""It's been really, really difficult,"" she says. ""I've had to go through so much.""

As the Beatles' ""Here Comes the Sun"" echoes across the room, Mom rushes to hug her daughter. As the two embrace, George Harrison's voice sings:

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces

Read the second part here. Also, read how CNN reported this story.

Sherburn, Minnesota (CNN) In a jaw-dropping moment caught on video, an 18-year-old high school senior rushes to escape from the hospital that saved her life and then, she says, held her captive.

At the entrance to the world-renowned Mayo Clinic, the young woman's stepfather helps her out of a wheelchair and into the family car.

Staff members come running toward him, yelling ""No! No!"" One of them grabs the young woman's arm.

""Get your hands off my daughter!"" her stepfather yells.

The car speeds away, the stepfather and the patient inside, her mother at the wheel.

Mayo security calls 911.

""We have had a patient abduction,"" the security officer tells police, according to a transcript of the call.

'A cautionary tale'

The patient's name is Alyssa Gilderhus.

She and her family say she wasn't abducted from the Mayo Clinic in February 2017; rather, she escaped. They say the hospital was keeping her there against her will -- that Mayo ""medically kidnapped"" her.

Unhappy with the care she was receiving at Mayo, they say, they repeatedly asked for her to be transferred to another hospital. They say Mayo refused.

According to police, Mayo officials had a different plan for Alyssa: They had asked the county for assistance in ""gaining guardianship of Alyssa,"" who was an adult.

Alyssa Gilderhus before her ruptured aneurysm and two-month hospitilization at the Mayo Clinic.

A spokeswoman for the Mayo Clinic said hospital officials would be willing to answer CNN's questions if Alyssa signed a privacy release form giving them permission to discuss her case publicly with CNN. The spokeswoman, Ginger Plumbo, supplied that form to CNN.

Alyssa signed the form, but Plumbo declined to answer CNN's questions on the record. Instead, she provided a statement, which said in part, ""We will not address these questionable allegations or publicly share the facts of this complex situation, because we do not believe it's in the best interest of the patient and the family. ... Our internal review determined that the care team's actions were true to Mayo Clinic's primary value that the patient's needs come first. We acted in a manner that honored that value for this patient and that also took into account the safety and well-being of the team caring for the patient.""

This story is based on interviews with Alyssa and members of her family, a family friend, law enforcement officials and a former member of a Mayo Clinic board, as well as documents including law enforcement records and Alyssa's medical records.

By everyone's account, this is an unfortunate and devastating story about a bitter clash that went out of control -- a clash between a Minnesota farm family and one of the world's most revered hospitals.

""It's confusing to me why this went off the rails so horribly,"" said Richard Saver, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, who at CNN's request reviewed medical and legal documents that the family and law enforcement officials provided to CNN.

Art Caplan, head of the Division of Medical Ethics at the New York University School of Medicine, also reviewed the documents, and he agrees.

""This should never have happened,"" he said. ""This is a cautionary tale.""

A Christmas Day aneurysm

The relationship between Alyssa's family and the Mayo Clinic started off well.

On Christmas morning 2016, Alyssa settled in with a mug of hot chocolate to open her gifts. She was surrounded by her large family: her mother, Amber Engebretson, a stay-at-home mom; Duane Engebretson, her stepfather since she was 4 years old, who manages a construction company and the family's farms; and her five younger siblings, then 18 months to 11 years old.

Alyssa Gilderhus on Christmas morning 2016.

They live in Sherburn, Minnesota, population just over 1,000 people, about 150 miles southwest of Minneapolis, on a farm with sheep, cows, horses and pigs.

Alyssa was thrilled with her first Christmas present: a pair of cowboy boots emblazoned with the emblem of the Future Farmers of America, her favorite club.

Then she went to the bathroom. Her parents heard screaming.

""Mom, I need you!"" Alyssa yelled as she lay curled up on the floor, vomiting.

It was immediately obvious this was much more than just a stomach bug. Her left side was very weak, and she couldn't hear out of her left ear.

""You could see looking at her that she was petrified,"" her stepfather said.

He called an ambulance. A local hospital determined that Alyssa, who'd always been healthy, had a ruptured brain aneurysm : A blood vessel inside her brain had suddenly and unexpectedly burst.

Surgeons explained that her life was on the line. They drilled a hole in her skull to relieve the pressure on her brain.

A nurse gave her parents a bag of Alyssa's hair, which had been shaved off for the operation. Some people liked to have it, she said.

Amber and Duane cried as they considered that this bag of hair -- their daughter's long, beautiful hair -- might be all they had left if she died.

They begged to have her sent to the Mayo Clinic. The main campus for the world-renowned medical center was 85 miles away in Rochester, Minnesota.

""They're the best. People come from all over the world to go to Mayo,"" said Alyssa's mother, Amber Engebretson, who worked as a vehicle inspector for the Minnesota State Patrol before staying home to care for her family.

But Alyssa couldn't get to Mayo immediately. There was an ice storm. Ambulances couldn't drive, and helicopters couldn't fly.

The weather eventually broke, and about 7 p.m. -- about nine hours after the aneurysm -- Alyssa finally arrived by ambulance at Mayo headquarters in Rochester.

On Christmas night, surgeons gave her a 2% chance of living, her parents said. Doctors wrote in her medical record that her prognosis was ""grim.""

Her parents reached out on Facebook for prayers. They called their daughter the #Christmasmiraclegirl.

Alyssa lived up to that name. She survived, thanks to four brain surgeries over the next month. Her doctors were ecstatic.

""They were like, she's not supposed to be here. She beat the odds,"" her stepfather said.

""Mayo neurosurgeons saved her life,"" added her mother. ""We'll be grateful to them forever.""

On January 30, Alyssa was transferred from the neurology unit to the rehabilitation unit.

It should have been a happy turning point. But that's when the troubles began.

Tensions flare

Although all had gone smoothly on the neurology floor, the family got into conflicts with the rehab staff almost immediately.

First, doctors there wanted to take Alyssa off oxycodone, a powerful opioid painkiller that the neurology doctors had prescribed for pain after surgery. Her most recent surgery -- the fourth in one month -- had been just a few days before.

""She'd lay in bed with tears coming out of her eyes because she was in so much pain,"" her stepfather said.

Many medical authorities, including the Mayo Clinic's website , say opioids are critical for post-surgical pain management.

A week after Alyssa arrived on the rehabilitation floor, her mother shared her feelings on Facebook.

""[Alyssa's] and my frustration level was high and it seems that they just don't listen sometimes,"" Amber wrote on February 7.

More disputes arose. Her parents say their daughter's breathing tube was the wrong size, and they had to pester doctors to get it corrected. They also say the family -- not doctors -- discovered that she had a bladder infection. They say a social worker discussed private financial information within earshot of visiting friends and relatives.

Her parents asked for the social worker and a doctor to be replaced.

""We just need someone who will at least listen to us and hear us,"" Amber wrote on her Facebook page on February 20.

Alyssa's parents say that at their request, they had a meeting with her care team on February 21.

""I had two whiteboards filled up with questions left unanswered, tests left undone, and every other question we could think of,"" Amber wrote on her Facebook page that day.

Amber says that at one point during that meeting, she told the staff she felt like they ""don't give a f***,"" later apologizing for her language. She also asked for a second doctor to stop taking care of their daughter.

""We took no crap and laid it all on the line. ... Because seriously what do we have to lose at this point,"" Amber wrote on Facebook that night.

Mayo kicks Mom out

On February 22, the day after that meeting, Amber got into a disagreement with a nursing aide and asked to have her removed from her daughter's care team. She was the fourth staffer the family had asked to be replaced in just three weeks.

That afternoon, Amber says, she was scheduled to have a meeting with the social worker -- the same one she'd asked to leave her daughter's care.

Amber had requested the meeting, and she says that as she approached the office at the appointed time, a man she'd never seen was standing in the office doorway. She said he saw her coming and went into the office and shut the door.

Amber listened through the door. She says that as she suspected, the man and the social worker were talking about her family.

""I proceeded to open the door and say, 'Since you're talking about my family, I think it's only appropriate that I would be here also, to be included in the conversation,' "" she remembers.

She says the man puffed out his chest and stepped toward her, and she took a backward step into the hall. The man, who Amber later learned was a physician, demanded that she leave.

She says the man told her, ""I run this whole rehab unit. Do you understand me?""

Amber describes the doctor as ""intensely aggressive.""

She replied to him, she says, with similar aggression and frustration: ""I need to talk to you. Do you understand me?""

The doctor walked away.

CNN reached out to this doctor and other staff members involved in Alyssa's care but did not receive responses.

About an hour later, Alyssa's parents say, the same doctor, the social worker and a nurse approached the family. They were accompanied by three security guards.

""[The doctor] said to me, 'You are not allowed to participate in Alyssa's care. You are not allowed on Mayo property. You will be escorted off the premises right now,' "" Amber remembers.

Alyssa Gilderhus with her mother, Amber Engebretson.

Amber and Duane say they asked why Amber was being kicked out but did not receive an answer.

Later, a social worker would tell police that ""Amber interrupted a meeting because Amber was upset over the care Alyssa was receiving. Due to that incident, Amber was escorted off of [Mayo] property.""

According to Alyssa's parents, the doctor told Duane that he could stay but that he would not be allowed to have any involvement in his stepdaughter's care.

The couple say they asked the doctor whether they could speak with a patient advocate.

""He said, 'There is no patient advocate,' and walked away,"" Amber said.

When asked about Amber's dismissal from the hospital, Mayo spokeswoman Plumbo sent CNN a statement.

""Our care teams act in the best interests of our patients. As a general practice, this includes sharing information with family members and facilitating family visits and interactions with patients and their care providers when the patient is in our care. However, in situations where care may be compromised or the safety and security of our staff are potentially at risk, the family members' ability to be present in the hospital may be restricted.""

Plumbo did not elaborate on whether or how Amber compromised her daughter's care or placed staff at risk.

""We would never compromise her care,"" Amber said. ""She's our daughter. We love her.""

She also says she never put staff members at risk. ""We would never do that -- ever,"" she said.

On February 23, the day after Amber was kicked out, she went on Facebook.

""PRAYER WARRIORS UNITE!!!! We need your help. ... Please READ THIS AND SHARE THIS POST in hopes it reaches the people or person who can help us,"" she wrote.

""I HAVE BEEN TOLD I AM NOT ALLOWED IN ALYSSA'S ROOM AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY SAY OR PARTICIPATE IN HER [CARE]. ... I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SEE HER!! We have been given no reason why, no paperwork, and no explanations,"" she continued. ""I never imagined something like this could happen in our world and a very hard situation already has been made even harder!!""

The response from one Facebook user led the family to conclude that they needed to get Alyssa out of Mayo, and fast.

'Basically a prisoner at Mayo'

Alyssa, who was legally an adult during her entire hospitalization, says that around this time, she started asking doctors and nurses to transfer her to another facility.

She says she never received a response.

""They were cruel to me,"" Alyssa said, adding that she wanted to get out of Mayo ""as bad as possible.""

On February 23, three weeks into her daughter's stay in rehab, Amber complained on Facebook, tagging Mayo.

""They refuse to let her go. ... We cannot transfer [Alyssa] out or get her discharged,"" she wrote. ""No one has any say in [Alyssa's care] and she is basically a prisoner of Mayo.""

Alyssa's stepfather and grandmother say they also asked to have her transferred out of Mayo.

""I asked two to three times a day, and it would go nowhere,"" Duane said.

""Duane said, 'This is ridiculous. We don't want her here; Alyssa doesn't want to be here; she doesn't feel safe here,' "" her grandmother Aimee Olson remembers. ""But there was no response.""

Duane says he tried to talk to a senior doctor on the rehab staff about a transfer. It was the same doctor who had asked his wife to leave the hospital.

""He said 'I have nothing to say to you. This is a legal problem,' "" Duane remembers. ""I even asked him, 'can I speak to your supervisor, your boss,' and his exact words were 'I run this whole floor,' and [he] turned around and walked out of the room, and that was it.'

Duane says he called the Mayo Patient Experience office and in a 45-minute phone call described the family's grievances. He said the patient experience specialist told him he would be back in touch after getting Mayo's side of the story.

Olson, Alyssa's grandmother and Amber's mother, said she also tried to speak with the senior doctor but was told he wasn't available.

""She was truly being held captive,"" Olson said. ""I would never believe a hospital could do that -- never in my wildest dreams.""

The family and a friend say they were instructed by Mayo staff not to talk to Alyssa about her mother.

Two nurses were assigned to be with Alyssa, and they kept careful watch, according to visitors.

""It was like they were watching every move you made,"" said Joy Schmitt, Alyssa's boyfriend's mother, who visited frequently after Amber was asked to leave the hospital.

'They were taking over our daughter'

On February 21, the day before her mother was kicked out of the hospital, a Mayo psychiatrist examined Alyssa and found that she lacked the capacity to make her own medical decisions, according to a summary of her care that her doctors wrote after she left Mayo.

Around this time, a hospital social worker went to adult protection services in two counties to try to get those authorities to get guardianship over Alyssa, according to the police. If they had succeeded, she would have become a ward of the state.

Alyssa and her family say that they weren't told any of this as it was happening but that around this time, they started to feel that Mayo was isolating Alyssa.

On February 26, staffers confiscated Alyssa's cell phone, laptop and tablet after finding that she'd made a video for her mother, according to Alyssa and her family. They say Alyssa's visitors were also banned from bringing their devices into the hospital.

The same day, Mayo staffers said no one would be allowed to stay overnight with Alyssa, according to Duane and Amber's sister, April Chance, who attended a meeting with Alyssa's care team.

Duane says he asked the staff to reconsider. He said his stepdaughter had never spent the night alone in the hospital. But he says they refused.

""The doctors said they were doing this for Alyssa's own benefit,"" Duane said.

The family says the doctors also told them that visitors would no longer be allowed to attend Alyssa's treatment sessions, such as physical and occupational therapy.

""I said, 'We're her cheerleaders. We cheer her on,' "" her aunt remembers. ""And they said 'No, you're impeding her care.' ""

She said the staff didn't elaborate on how they were impeding her care.

""They were restricting us little by little from even being with Alyssa. They were taking over our daughter,"" Duane said.

Mayo also pushed back Alyssa's discharge date, which was supposed to be February 27.

Meanwhile, her mother's following was growing on Facebook, with many users posting angry messages that tagged Mayo.

One woman sent Amber links to stories about a teenager named Justina Pelletier.

Articles in The Boston Globe and elsewhere described how in 2013, Pelletier, then 14 years old, was placed in state custody for nearly 16 months after Boston Children's Hospital accused her parents of interfering in her care. She spent much of that time in a psychiatric ward.

Amber says she spoke on the phone with Justina's parents, Linda and Lou Pelletier. She says they warned her there would be signs that the hospital was seeking guardianship for their daughter. They would keep a tight watch over her and limit her communications with her family.

Through their lawyer, John T. Martin, the Pelletiers confirmed that they had conversations with Amber.

A spokeswoman for Boston Children's Hospital told CNN that the hospital is ""committed to the best interest of our patients' health and well-being"" and declined to discuss the specifics of the case.

Amber sent a text to the woman who'd sent her the news articles.

""OMG I am SICK. This is what is happening,"" Amber wrote. ""It rings lots and lots of bells. ... Omg ... I am so scared.""

A Mayo board member steps in

Alyssa's parents reached out to a friend of a friend for help: Mark Gaalswyk, who at the time was a member of the board of directors for the Mayo Clinic Health System in Fairmont, Minnesota.

Gaalswyk emailed a Mayo Clinic vice president. He informed her of the situation and explained that CNN had contacted the family.

""Could you please please do what you can to get your arms around the [situation] immediately?!"" he wrote. ""Please get to the bottom of this quickly before it blows up even more.""

But Gaalswyk's pull wasn't enough.

He says Mayo treated Alyssa ""terribly.""

""I'm probably the most pro-Mayo person who has walked the face of this earth,"" said Gaalswyk, who left the board January 1. ""But this was a mess.""

He said he thinks Amber probably ""used words she shouldn't have"" with hospital staff.

""I'm not saying that Amber is 100 percent in the right,"" he added, ""but I know what Mayo did is not OK at all.""

In its statement to CNN, the Mayo spokeswoman said that ""Mayo Clinic is committed to the safety and wellbeing of all the patients we treat.""

Feeling like they were running out of options, Alyssa's parents then enlisted the help of Karie Rego, an attorney and patient advocate they'd met on Facebook.

On February 27, Rego spoke on the phone with Joshua Murphy, Mayo's chief legal officer, and faxed him a letter urging Mayo to transfer Alyssa to another facility.

""Given what has happened here, an expedited transfer this coming week would be best for everyone,"" she wrote.

Rego says an attorney in Murphy's office called her later. She says that he told her he couldn't speak with her and that she never heard anything more from Mayo's legal department.

That night, Alyssa's parents thought about Justina Pelletier and the 16 months she spent in state custody.

They went online and printed a form for Alyssa to sign, saying she was leaving the hospital against medical advice.

But her parents didn't know how they would get her out. Two nurses were assigned to keep watch over her at all times.

They started to hatch a plan to get her out of Mayo the very next day.

Read the first part here. Also, read how CNN reported this story.

Sherburn, Minnesota (CNN) One winter afternoon last year, Duane Engebretson sat in his stepdaughter's hospital room at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, trying to figure out how she could escape.

Alyssa Gilderhus, 18 and a senior in high school, had been a patient at Mayo for about two months, ever since having a ruptured brain aneurysm on Christmas Day.

Alyssa Gilderhus before her ruptured brain aneursym and hospitilization at the Mayo Clinic.

Mayo neurosurgeons saved her life, but she and her parents were unhappy with the care she was receiving in the rehabilitation unit, and they say they repeatedly asked for her to be transferred.

But they say Mayo refused to let her transfer to another hospital, even after a lawyer wrote a letter asking Mayo to make the arrangements.

Alyssa and her family began to suspect that Mayo was trying to get a guardian appointed to make medical decisions for her. They were right: Hospital staffers would later tell police that they had gone to two county adult protection agencies to make guardianship arrangements.

Alyssa Gilderhus with her siblings at the Mayo Clinic.

Duane and his wife, Amber Engebretson, weren't sure how to get their daughter out of Mayo. Two nurses had been assigned to watch over her at all times.

But on February 28, 2017, an idea struck Duane as he sat in Alyssa's hospital room.

He looked at one of the nurses. She had been with them a few weeks before, when Alyssa's great-grandmother had come for a visit.

Betty Stalheim was 80. She'd just had knee surgery. She was fragile.

If he told the nurses that Grandma Betty wanted to visit but couldn't make it all the way upstairs to Alyssa's room, it might just sound believable, he figured.

He put his plan into action about 4 p.m., with his 9-year-old daughter, Allie, secretly videotaping with a small GoPro camera hidden in her hand. He told CNN he wanted the videotape to show that Alyssa had left the hospital willingly and that he hadn't been violent with staff, and to record actions taken by Mayo employees.

Duane told the nurses he wanted to take Alyssa downstairs to say hello to Grandma Betty in the lobby.

The video shows Duane pushing Alyssa in her wheelchair down the hospital hallway. She has a bandage on her neck where her breathing tube had been removed a few days before.

Two women in scrubs follow them.

When the group arrives in the lobby, there is no Grandma Betty.

Duane says he sees Grandma Betty's car at the entrance and walks out the hospital doors with the two staff members trailing behind him.

As he approaches the car, the front passenger door opens.

There is no Grandma Betty. She was never there. Instead, Alyssa's mother is in the driver's seat.

""Alyssa, we're going to go home, honey. Come on,"" Amber says to her daughter.

As Duane helps his stepdaughter out of the wheelchair and into the passenger seat, the two women in scrubs run toward her, and someone yells, ""No!""

""Yes, she is! Yes, she is!"" Duane and Amber yell back.

The video shows a hand grabbing Alyssa's arm as Duane helps her into the car. A nursing aide would later tell police she had tried to grab her.

""Get your hands off my daughter,"" Duane yells at the aide.

Duane closes the car door and gets in the back seat.

""Get out of here, Amber,"" he tells his wife. ""Go, go, go, go, go, go!""

The car drives away from Mayo.

Recalling her escape some months later, Alyssa says it felt ""phenomenal.""

""It was like the biggest weight off my shoulders,"" she said.

'We have a patient abduction'

At 4:28 p.m., a Rochester Police dispatcher received a call from Mayo Clinic security.

""We have a patient abduction,"" the caller said.

An officer arrived on the scene 20 minutes later.

A Mayo social worker told him that Alyssa ""cannot make decisions for herself"" and that her mother couldn't care for her ""because Amber has mental health issues.""

The social worker also told police she ""understood there was no formal diagnosis"" for Amber.

Amber told CNN she has no history of mental illness and took offense to the social worker making such an unqualified pronouncement.

Alyssa Gilderhus as a child with her grandmother Betty Stalheim, mother, Amber Engebretson, and younger siblings.

""It's absolutely absurd,"" Amber said. ""She said it to the police department. She has no reasoning. She has no justification.""

The social worker told the police she'd been working with adult protection services in two Minnesota counties ""trying to get emergency guardianship"" but had been unable to get court orders to do so.

An Olmsted County Adult Protective Services official told police that ""Mayo was requesting [assistance] in gaining guardianship of Alyssa because they were concerned for the mother's mental health and the medical decisions that were being made for Alyssa.""

But something didn't quite make sense to John Sherwin, captain of investigations for the Rochester Police Department.

If Alyssa couldn't make decisions for herself, as the social worker had said, and if she needed a legal guardian appointed for her, then who had been making decisions for her while she was in the hospital?

When police asked that question of Mayo staffers, Sherwin said, they replied that Alyssa had been making her own medical decisions.

""When doctors were consulting with her in regards to her medical care, they weren't doing so through a guardian or someone that had been appointed by the courts. It was in direct contact with the patient,"" Sherwin said.

He said it became clear to investigators that Alyssa ""in fact could make decisions on her own"" -- including the decision to leave the hospital against medical advice.

""There was no abduction. This was done under her own will,"" he said. ""You had a patient that left the hospital under their own planning.""

Though satisfied that Alyssa was capable of making her own decisions, Sherwin still was concerned about her health.

""What was relayed to us [by Mayo staff] was that the patient was in danger of dying if they were not in the hospital,"" Sherwin said.

Mayo sent the police an order for a 72-hour hold, which allows police to admit someone to a hospital emergency room against their will if they're a danger to themselves.

But first, the police had to find Alyssa.

Police search for Alyssa

Alyssa and her parents were on the run. They weren't answering their cell phones, and they weren't at home, either.

They later told CNN they figured the police would bring Alyssa to a hospital, and given the large number of Mayo facilities in Minnesota, there was a good chance that hospital would be a Mayo hospital.

""We felt that if [Mayo] got their hands on her, they would latch on and we wouldn't get her back again,"" Duane said.

Alyssa moments after she escaped from the Mayo Clinic with the help of her parents.

Unable to find the family, the police pinged their cell phones. This pointed them to an Applebee's restaurant in Mankato, Minnesota, about 85 miles west of Rochester. Officers searched the restaurant and a nearby Five Guys but couldn't find Alyssa, according to a Mankato police report.

It turned out the ping was a bit off: The family was down the street at Walmart, purchasing a wheelchair, a walker and a syringe for Alyssa's feeding tube, which Duane says he'd been trained to use. They then checked into a nearby hotel.

While at the hotel, the family received a phone call from a Martin County sheriff's deputy. They say they told the deputy that their daughter was doing well, and they planned to bring her to a doctor the next day to get her checked.

The deputy said that wasn't good enough. He told them they were on their way to them, according to the family.

Alyssa and her parents scrambled and left the hotel.

It was now almost 9 p.m., and nearly five hours had passed since they'd left Mayo. The family was on the road with three police agencies -- Rochester, Mankato and Martin County -- on their heels.

As Alyssa's stepfather drove down the highway, a sheriff's deputy called, urging them to bring their daughter to a hospital right away. They told him they'd bring her to a hospital in Jackson, about 75 miles away.

But then, the family reconsidered. They'd chosen Jackson because it had a hospital that wasn't owned by Mayo. But they feared that the doctors there might transfer her to a Mayo facility.

After the calls from police, Alyssa's parents figured out that their phones were being pinged and took the batteries out.

They got off the highway and drove on gravel roads without a map.

""I just kept heading west. I knew I would run into South Dakota sooner or later,"" he said.

'This kid is in danger'

The next afternoon, March 1, one of Alyssa's doctors, a pediatric rehabilitation specialist at Mayo, spoke on the phone with Sherry Bush-Seim, a Rochester police investigator.

The doctor warned that Alyssa was in grave danger.

""The longer she's away, the higher likelihood that she's gonna get very, very sick,"" the physician said, according to a transcript of the conversation that police provided to CNN.

The day Alyssa left Mayo, that doctor and a colleague had written a discharge note.

""Alyssa's medical condition, medical status, cognition, and physical impairments require an ongoing inpatient level of medical care,"" the doctors wrote. ""She was not medically or functionally safe to leave the hospital at the time of her removal from the hospital by her stepfather.""

Alyssa was at risk for pneumonia, malnourishment, dehydration, aspiration, infection and falling, according to the note. She didn't have her medications with her, and her parents weren't trained on how to use her feeding tube, according to the discharge summary.

The doctor said Alyssa was probably ""a ways from here by now"" and requested a wider-scale search.

""[It's] incredibly frustrating that something isn't out nationally given that [this] family may be hopping from doctor to doctor,"" the doctor said.

""We wouldn't do that nationally,"" Bush-Seim responded. ""That wouldn't be done.""

Without a national search, the doctor said, ""we're not gonna find her.""

Bush-Seim assured the physician that the Rochester police had ""done everything they possibly could to find her.""

""There's got to be something more. This kid is in danger,"" Alyssa's doctor responded.

The police back off

But other doctors disagreed with the Mayo physician.

Less than 12 hours after leaving Mayo, she and her parents arrived at the emergency room for Sanford Medical Center in Sioux Falls, a teaching hospital for the University of South Dakota.

They explained to Sanford doctors that she'd had an aneurysm and left Mayo against medical advice, according to medical records from that emergency room visit.

The Sanford doctors disagreed with the Mayo doctors on two crucial points.

Although Mayo doctors had insisted that Alyssa needed to be in the hospital, the Sanford doctors came to the opposite conclusion: They prescribed Alyssa medications, gave instructions for her to follow up with a doctor and told her she could go home.

Mayo had determined that Alyssa lacked the mental capacity to make her own decisions. The Sanford doctors again came to the opposite conclusion: They allowed her to make her own decisions and sign her own forms consenting to treatment.

When police learned that a hospital had cleared Alyssa to go home, they stepped aside.

""If a doctor at another facility says she's fine and comes up with a second opinion, that kind of takes the law out of it,"" said Chris Vasvick, a Martin County sheriff's deputy. ""That's one doctor's opinion against another, and that doesn't have anything to do with law enforcement at all.""

Sherwin, the Rochester detective, agreed.

""We didn't have any reason for the police to intervene,"" Sherwin said.

He added that Alyssa and her parents had done nothing illegal. No charges were filed against them.

""As parents, they were probably thinking that they were acting on her best interest. I think the same could be said for the doctors and staff at Mayo Clinic. I think that they also felt they were acting on her best interest,"" Sherwin said.

A few days after her visit to the Sanford emergency room, Alyssa and her parents went home.

A letter from Mayo was waiting for them, thanking Duane for getting in touch with the patient experience office.

The family found it ironic, given that it was dated March 1, the day after Alyssa left the hospital.

A few days later, another letter arrived from an administrator at Mayo, saying that it would not treat Alyssa or her parents.

""We have made this decision because of your actions which demonstrate a lack of trust and confidence in Mayo,"" the administrator wrote.

On Facebook, Amber shared that Alyssa's health was improving.

""This kid amazes me every day!! And we all could not be more proud!!"" she wrote.

'Hospitals aren't prisons'

To understand the legal and ethical issues in Alyssa's case, CNN showed experts key documents, including law enforcement reports; a transcript of portions of CNN's interview with Sherwin, the detective at the Rochester Police Department; and summaries of her care written by doctors at Mayo and Sanford.

The experts emphasized that those documents don't tell the whole story; only a thorough reading of her full medical records and interviews with Mayo staff would provide a complete picture.

""You're only hearing one side,"" cautioned Dr. Chris Feudtner, a professor of pediatrics, medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.

After reviewing the documents, the experts wondered why Mayo did not allow Alyssa, who was 18 and legally an adult, to leave the hospital when she made clear that she wanted to be transferred, according to the family.

They said that typically, adult patients have the right to leave the hospital against medical advice, and they can leave without signing any paperwork.

""Hospitals aren't prisons. They can't hold you there against your will,"" said George Annas, an attorney and director of the Center for Health Law, Ethics & Human Rights at the Boston University School of Public Health.

But Alyssa's doctors say she wasn't a typical patient.

""Due to the severity of her brain injury, she does not have the capacity to make medical decisions,"" her doctors wrote in her records after she'd left the hospital.

In that report, the doctors specified that assessments in the last week of her hospital stay showed that she lacked ""the capacity to decide to sign releases of information, make pain medication dose changes, and make disposition decisions. This includes signing paperwork agreeing to leave the hospital against medical advice.""

That hadn't jibed with the captain of investigations for the Rochester police. Sherwin said it didn't make sense that Mayo staffers told police Alyssa had been making her own decisions, yet in the discharge note, they stated she wasn't capable of making her own decisions.

It didn't jibe with the experts, either.

""They can't eat their cake and have it, too,"" said Feudtner, the medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.

Even if Alyssa truly did lack the capacity to make her own medical decisions, the experts had questions about Mayo's efforts to obtain emergency guardianship for Alyssa.

Brian Smith, the Rochester police officer who responded to Mayo's 911 call the day Alyssa left Mayo, said a Mayo social worker told him she'd been working for a week or two to get a Minnesota county to take guardianship over Alyssa.

""The county would have guardianship over her and would make decisions for her,"" he told CNN.

If that happened, Alyssa most likely would have stayed at Mayo, as she was already receiving treatment there, Smith said.

Bush-Seim, the Rochester police investigator, spoke with an official at one of the county adult protection agencies. She said it was also her understanding that Mayo wanted the county to take guardianship of Alyssa, or that perhaps Mayo itself wanted to directly take guardianship of her.

The legal experts said they were not surprised that Mayo was unable to get court orders for such guardianship arrangements. It's a drastic and highly unusual step for a county or a hospital to take guardianship over a patient, they said, rather than have a family member become the patient's surrogate decision-maker.

Robert McLeod, a Minneapolis attorney who helped the state legislature draft its guardianship laws, did not review the documents pertaining to Alyssa, as he did not want to comment on any specific case.

He said that before appointing a county or a hospital as a legal guardian, a judge would ask why a family member or close friend hadn't been selected as a surrogate.

""From my 25 years of experience, a judge is going to say, 'why isn't the family the first and best choice here?' and it had better be a good reason,"" said McLeod, an adjunct professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

Other experts agreed.

Saver, the professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said that in his four years working in the general counsel's office at the University of Chicago Hospitals and Health System, he doesn't once remember the hospital seeking guardianship for a patient who had a responsible relative or friend who could act as surrogates.

""It's thought of as kind of the atom bomb remedy,"" Saver said. ""I'm a little flummoxed what to make of this. They had family members on the scene to look to.""

Alyssa said her biological father, Jason Gilderhus, told her that Mayo asked him to become her guardian. He did not become her guardian and did not respond to CNN's attempts to reach him.

Even if Mayo had concerns about Alyssa's mother and her biological father didn't work out, there were other friends and relatives to turn to, such as her stepfather, grandmother, great-grandmother, aunt or boyfriend's mother.

""It's so baffling why they didn't try to designate a surrogate before trying to get a guardian,"" added Dr. R. Gregory Cochran, a physician and lawyer and associate director of the Health Policy and Law program at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.

Another feature of Alyssa's case also surprised the experts.

Caplan, the NYU bioethicist, said that in complicated and contentious cases like this one, doctors typically reach out to their hospital's ethics committee for help.

An ethics committee would listen to the doctors, other staff members, the patient and the family to try to resolve the conflict.

The family says no one ever mentioned an ethics committee to them, and there's no mention of an ethics committee consult in the discharge summary in Alyssa's medical records.

Annas, the lawyer at Boston University, agreed that an ethics committee consultation would have been an obvious and important way to help resolve the dispute before it spun out of control.

""Disputes between families and hospital staff happen all the time, and they can either escalate or de-escalate,"" Annas said. ""An ethics consult can help sort out the issues so they de-escalate.""

The experts said they were disappointed that in Alyssa's case, the conflict escalated.

""I was shocked to see that parents had to pull a fast one to get their daughter out of the hospital,"" said Cochran, of the University of California.

""I felt sad,"" said Feudtner, the ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. ""Viewed in its entirety, this did not go well for anybody who was involved.""

Gaalswyk, the former Mayo board member, said he hopes the hospital learns something.

""I hope that someone somewhere will look at what happened in this unfortunate case and improve both our Mayo employee's actions and patient systems so that it not need happen again to any other patient at Mayo,"" he wrote a Mayo vice president after Alyssa left the hospital. ""The situation need not get out of hand like it did.""

Being 'held hostage in an American hospital'

While the details of Alyssa's case are extraordinary -- the Grandma Betty trick, the escape from the hospital with police on their heels -- the core of her story is not uncommon in many ways, according to patient advocates.

Dr. Julia Hallisy, founder of the Empowered Patient Coalition, says families often tell her that a hospital won't allow their loved one to transfer to another facility. Often, they're afraid to say anything publicly or on social media.

""You sound like a crazy person -- that your family member was held hostage in an American hospital,"" she said. ""People can't believe that would happen. It's like the stuff of a science fiction story.""

Kristen Spyker said it happened to her family.

When Spyker's son was born with a rare heart defect, she says she told doctors at the Ohio hospital where he was born that she wanted him to have a surgical repair at a hospital with a larger pediatric heart program.

She said the heart surgeon at the first hospital refused to send her son's medical records to other hospitals. She also says a surgeon resisted her efforts to transfer her newborn son to another hospital to get a second opinion on what surgery he should have for a rare heart defect.

""The surgeon said, 'This is my patient. This is my show. I'm the boss, and I say what happens,' "" she said.

She said a social worker, accompanied by hospital security guards, then came into her son's hospital room and said she was worried that Spyker had postpartum depression that was affecting her ability to make decisions for her son's care.

Spyker said the hospital discharged her son only after she threatened legal action.

Her son then had a successful procedure at another hospital -- a different procedure than the one recommended by the first doctor.

When she told her story on Facebook, Spyker said, other parents shared similar stories.

""It was parent after parent after parent saying 'this happened to us,'"" she said. ""They had been so embarrassed to talk about it, but they felt freer when I said it happened to us.""

Spyker was one of several people who spoke with Alyssa's parents last year while their daughter was at Mayo.

In a statement to CNN, the American Hospital Association addressed conflicts between families and hospitals.

""Communication between physicians and patients is extremely important in working to identify the best treatment,"" said Dr. Jay Bhatt, senior vice president and chief medical officer of the organization. ""Each patient is unique. It is for this reason that the majority of hospitals have patient advocates on staff to help patients and families navigate the care process. Hospitals recognize that patients are critical members of any care team and many are employing new strategies to ensure their voice and perspective is heard and accounted for.""

When hospitals and families get into intense conflict, Hallisy, a dentist who practices in San Francisco, says human emotions can run amok. She says she saw it happen when her daughter, Katherine, was being treated for cancer.

""People think that doctors are immune to petty disagreements, but they're human beings, and sometimes ego and primitive emotions take over,"" she said.

She said that in Alyssa's case, she wonders whether a sensitive hospital staffer, perhaps a social worker, could have prevented the situation from becoming as contentious as it did.

She thinks back to her daughter, who died at age 10. She remembers the sadness and fear of having a very sick child, as well as the stress of taking care of her two other children and keeping her dental practice afloat while her daughter was in and out of the hospital.

She thinks about how Alyssa was near death and how her parents had five younger children 130 miles away, as well as farms and a family business to run.

""They were under incredible stress,"" Hallisy said. ""They'd almost lost a child, and they had other responsibilities, too. You would think that someone at Mayo would be trained to see that.""

The prom queen graduates

More than a year after leaving the Mayo Clinic, Alyssa, now 20, has belied her ""grim prognosis.""

The students of Martin County West High School crowned Alyssa Gilderhus prom queen.

Last year, she graduated from Martin County West High School, receiving a standing ovation from her class. She stayed out all night at her senior prom, where her classmates voted her prom queen. The local chapter of Future Farmers of America gave her the Star Farmer award.

Her feeding tube came out a few months after she left Mayo, and she can eat and speak normally now. She can walk on her own without any assistance. Last summer, she presented her fantail pigeons at the Minnesota State Fair and competed in the poultry princess competition.

She finished up her physical and speech therapy in March, about a year after leaving Mayo. She'll be a freshman at Southwest Minnesota State University in September.

Alyssa has not filed a lawsuit, but has engaged Martin, the lawyer who is also representing the Pelletier family.

Alyssa and her parents say they haven't recovered emotionally from what happened at Mayo. They say they still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, panicked about what would have happened if they hadn't snuck her out of the hospital.

""I think she would be [at the hospital] and nobody would be able to see her,"" her stepfather said.

They say Mayo still hasn't given them an explanation for why it was trying to arrange guardianship for Alyssa.

They think Mayo was trying to get guardianship in retaliation for questioning the staff, especially a senior physician.

""I think that the doctor I made mad wanted to make sure that I paid for it no matter what,"" her mother said.

She's told that's a pretty hefty accusation.

""We stand by it 100 percent,"" her stepfather said."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180808132719-11-new-escape-from-mayo-super-tease.jpg
5816e2fa37e74a61884dd86d8114d0ca	['Jacqueline Howard']	2018-08-14 00:00:00	Historic face transplant gives suicide survivor a 'second chance'	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Historic face transplant gives suicide survivor a 'second chance'	1	"(CNN) As Katie Stubblefield brushed her fingers across her face, she could feel the wound.

Her vision is greatly impaired due to her injury, but touching her face allowed her to feel what her doctors were working around the clock to treat. She could feel where her face was swollen. She could feel the portions that were missing.

That was before Katie, at 21, became the youngest person in the United States to receive a face transplant. The transplant, performed last year, aims to restore Katie's face structure and functions -- such as chewing, breathing and swallowing -- which were lost in a severe gunshot injury, the haunting outcome of a suicide attempt as a teenager.

Now, Katie hopes to use her historic surgery to raise awareness about the lasting harms of suicide and the precious value of life.

She is featured on the cover of National Geographic magazine's September issue , which debuted Tuesday, in an article titled ""The Story of a Face"" and in National Geographic's full-length documentary ""Katie's Face.""

'I had no clue what a face transplant was'

In the days prior to Katie's suicide attempt, she faced a number of emotional hurdles.

She underwent surgery for chronic gastrointestinal problems, and she faced betrayal in a personal relationship. Around that time, Katie's mother, Alesia, was abruptly fired from a teaching job at Katie's school because Alesia ""questioned several decisions that were made lacking integrity,"" Katie's father, Robb, told CNN.

Asking for help The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK. There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454. The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller's ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.



The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.

On March 25, 2014, when Katie was 18, her older brother, Robert Stubblefield, heard the gunfire and found her after she harmed herself in a bathroom at his home in Mississippi.

He was devastated.

Katie doesn't remember that tragic day when she lost her face. She has said that she doesn't remember much of that year -- including being hospitalized in Oxford, Mississippi; being flown to another hospital in Memphis, Tennessee; and then being transferred to Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, where she would undergo her face transplantation three years later.

It was in Memphis where Katie's parents, Robb and Alesia, heard the term ""face transplant"" for the first time.

""There was an older trauma surgeon who basically told us, 'It's the worst wound that I've ever seen of its kind,' and he said, 'The only thing I can think of that would really give her functional life again is a face transplant,' "" Robb said.

""I was standing there thinking, 'What do you mean, a face transfer? What do you do?' ""

When Katie was later told about the possible procedure, she said, she was equally stunned.

""I had no clue what a face transplant was,"" Katie said. ""When my parents helped explain everything to me, I was very excited to get a face again and to have function again.""

At left, Katie Stubblefield at 17, eight months before attempting suicide. At right, Katie at 22, one year and one month after her surgery.

Full and partial face transplants are medical procedures that involve replacing all or parts of a person's face with donated tissue, including skin, bone, nerves and blood vessels from a deceased donor.

Katie's procedure involved transplanting the scalp, forehead, upper and lower eyelids, eye sockets, nose, upper cheeks, upper jaw and half of lower jaw, upper teeth, lower teeth, partial facial nerves, muscles and skin -- effectively replacing her full facial tissue, according to Cleveland Clinic

Similar to Katie, the first recipient of a face transplant in the United States was a woman who survived a gunshot wound to the head. That patient, Connie Culp, underwent a 22-hour transplant surgery at Cleveland Clinic and debuted her new face in 2009.

That was a near-total face transplant. The world's first successful full face transplant was conducted at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain, in 2010.

As for where Katie fits in, ""only 40 people in the world have ever had a face transplant, and we believe that she is the 39th person,"" said Susan Goldberg, editor-in-chief of National Geographic magazine

""We think her story is one of the most important stories that we will do this year,"" Goldberg said of the magazine. ""We thought it was just such a moving and inspiring story that is about everything from human journey to breakthrough medicine and science.""

'You take it for granted, the different components of our faces'

Before Katie's face transplantation, surgeons at Cleveland Clinic used 3D printing to help reconstruct about 90% of her lower jaw, said Dr. Brian Gastman, a plastic surgeon at Cleveland Clinic who led Katie's surgery and oversaw her care.

The surgical team used CT scans of the jaw of Katie's older sister, Olivia McCay, to 3D-print a model template for the reconstruction.

""We made a plate designed for the combination of Katie and her sister's jaw, and that's what we used to make Katie's jaw before we did the transplant,"" Gastman said.

He noted that when he first saw Katie's injury, he worried that she might not live.

A surgical resident carefully cradles Katie's head to keep it still as she's situated in the intensive care unit after the 31-hour procedureconcluded. To protect her eyes, her eyelids were sutured shut. With the transplant complete, Katie would still require additional operations and many months of rehabilitation.

In March 2016, Katie was placed on the waiting list for a face transplant. Fourteen months later, a donor was found: Adrea Schneider, a 31-year-old woman who died of a drug overdose, National Geographic reported. Before the procedure, Katie underwent extensive psychological evaluation as a face transplant candidate and suicide survivor.

After she was cleared to receive her new face, the 31-hour surgery began May 4, 2017. It involved 11 surgeons, several other specialists and virtual reality. The surgery was completed the next day.

""I am able to touch my face now, and it feels amazing,"" said Katie, who still has some difficulty speaking clearly.

Her father, Robb, translated some of her sentiments: ""You take it for granted, the different components of our faces -- the bone, the tissue, the muscle, everything -- but when it's gone, you recognize the big need. Then when you receive a transplant, you're so thankful.""

Nine months and 22 days before Katie's face transplant, at Cleveland's Tudor Arms Hotel, Katie and her father sing ""Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?"" as they share a dance. ""Before this, I never spent so much time with my parents,"" said Katie, who credits their love and devotion with helping to save her life.

Katie was discharged from Cleveland Clinic on August 1, 2017. She takes immunosuppressive drugs to reduce her risk of transplant rejection , which occurs when a transplant recipient's immune system attacks the transplanted organ or tissue. She will continue to take the medication for the rest of her life.

Katie also continues physical and occupational therapy, works with a speech therapist and takes Braille lessons.

""I'm definitely taking many, many daily steps,"" Katie said of her rehab progress, adding that her family has been a big help in her recovery and that her faith has kept her strong.

""Life is precious, and life is beautiful,"" she said.

Face transplantation is considered experimental, and insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid don't cover it. A grant from the US Department of Defense, through the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine , covered Katie's transplant, according to National Geographic. The institute works to develop advanced treatment options -- including face transplantation -- for severely wounded servicemen and -women.

""I remember Dr. Gastman mentioned to me, he said basically that Katie was kind of the quintessential potential candidate for a face transplant. One, because of the type of wound that she suffered, but also she is in that age bracket of so many soldiers,"" Robb said. ""She's in that late-teen to early 20s, where so many young soldiers are being wounded and injured.""

While Katie's medical care team hopes that her surgery can advance the field of face transplantation, there are many other hopes for her future.

Katie plans to attend college online soon, possibly followed by a career in counseling and motivational speaking. She hopes to raise awareness about suicide and suicide prevention.

""My first wish for Katie is to be happy,"" Gastman said.

""That's number one, but beyond that, I'd like her to have some level of normalcy,"" he said. ""Then, she can do all that and become a spokeswoman for so many aspects -- for how to be strong in the face of adversity and not to make a singular decision dictate who you are. Further, on the other hand, how much a singular rash decision made by so many young people today could negatively change your whole life.""

He said Katie ""had the ultimate second chance.""

Suicide awareness remains critical, said Katie's mother, Alesia.

Globally, close to 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, which is about one person every 40 seconds, according to the World Health Organization

In 2016, guns were the most common method used in suicide deaths in the US, accounting for 22,963 -- almost half of all -- suicide deaths, according to the National Institute of Mental Health

Among young people, ""I think we do a pretty decent job of educating them about sex and about drinking and driving,"" but education around suicide prevention is lacking, Alesia said.

""I can honestly tell you, for Katie, we do not believe for one moment that she wanted to die,"" Alesia said. ""But we do believe she hit that low where she definitely tried and thought about it, and for a moment -- 20 seconds or less -- kids can make those decisions."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180810162525-02-face-transplant-katie-stubblefield-restricted-super-tease.jpg
052b6441e352433ba5ef066a8e4f8064	['Elizabeth Cohen', 'Aaron Kessler', 'Cnn Video John Bonifield']	2018-07-27 00:00:00	Essure: Bayer paid doctors millions for questionable birth control device	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Essure: Bayer paid doctors millions for questionable birth control device	1	"Petersburg, Indiana (CNN) When Christina Potts was looking for permanent birth control, she said, her doctor was a ""cheerleader"" for one option and one option only: Essure.

Potts says the device, which is implanted in a woman's fallopian tubes to block sperm from reaching an egg, left her in terrible pain and extremely fatigued.

It was so bad that she had a hysterectomy, removing her uterus and tubes to get rid of Essure.

Last week, the US Food and Drug Administration expressed safety concerns about Essure, and Bayer Pharmaceuticals announced that it would pull the device off the market at the end of the year.

Potts says she'll always wonder this: Did her former gynecologist recommend Essure because it was best for her or because Bayer paid the doctor tens of thousands of dollars?

A CNN analysis of federal data, shows that from August 2013 through December 2017, Bayer paid 11,850 doctors $2.5 million related to Essure for consulting fees and similar services.

These payments are legal but very controversial.

Potts' doctor was one of the highest earners, according to federal data. Dr. Cindy Basinski was paid $168,068 for consulting fees and similar services from August 2013 through the end of 2017.

More than 80% of the money that Bayer paid to Indiana doctors for Essure was paid to her. Nationally, she was the second highest-paid doctor for the service, one of just three doctors to earn more than $100,000.

The financial information comes from a federal database that covers August 2013 through the end of last year. Basinski said she also received payments related to Essure for about five years before that, but the database doesn't go back that far, and Basinski says she doesn't remember what she was paid during those years.

""I will tell you that my best guess is that early on it was very minimal, $5,000 to $7,000 a year,"" she said.

Basinski says she's so convinced of Essure's safety that she'll continue to implant it into women until the device comes off the market.

Dr. Cindy Basinski said ""I did a lot of work to earn that money. A majority of activities were involved with educating physicians.""

In those studies, the payments are typically much more modest than what Basinski has received. But the gynecologist said her clinical judgment hasn't been swayed by the money.

""I will say that I do not feel that it influenced me at all in any way,"" she said.

She said she could have earned the same amount if she'd been seeing patients during the hours she was paid by Bayer to educate doctors about the device and how to implant it.

""I think that there can be professional relationships with companies and physicians. I did a lot of work to earn that money,"" she said. ""A majority of activities were involved with educating physicians.""

She added that she's turned down money -- in some cases more than Bayer paid her -- because she did not believe in a certain product.

Bayer announced last week that declining sales is the reason it will pull the device off the market and that it stands by the safety of its product.

But according to a US Food and Drug Administration statement put out the same day, the device has been associated with ""serious risks including persistent pain, perforation of the uterus and fallopian tubes, and migration of the coils into the pelvis or abdomen.""

Bayer's announcement came just days before Netflix premiered a documentary about the dangers of Essure and other medical devices, ""The Bleeding Edge.""

On Friday, Bayer posted a ""fact check"" to the documentary, which states that the film ""presents an inaccurate and misleading picture of Essure.""

Also Friday, the pharmaceutical company published an ""Open Letter to Patients and Providers About Essure,"" which states that the company's decision to stop selling Essure ""was not based on concerns about the safety and efficacy of Essure. Essure has been on the market for more than 15 years and has been successfully used by hundreds of thousands of women.""

The Netflix documentary features a group of women who lobbied Congress for years to get Essure off the market.

Their private Facebook group, Essure Problems, has more than 37,000 members, including more than 12,000 women who say they've had a hysterectomy or other surgical procedure to remove the device, according to group founder Angie Firmalino.

'I felt like she was very pushy'

When Potts, who teaches children with special needs in Petersburg, Indiana, gave birth to twins Eli and Brena in 2006, she and her husband knew that they wanted permanent birth control. With four children -- they have an older daughter and son -- their family was complete.

Potts, then 27, asked Basinski about getting her fallopian tubes tied, but she says Basinski told her that wasn't a good choice for a woman with four young children, because it involved recovery time from the surgery. Essure could be implanted vaginally right in the office, in a procedure much like a routine Pap smear.

Christina Potts had a hysterectomy to remove her Essure device.

""She was very upbeat about it,"" Potts said. ""I felt like she was very pushy.""

She and other patients who saw Basinski told CNN that the doctor seemed like a cheerleader for Essure. Potts said that's why she didn't call Basinski when she developed headaches, joint pain, abdominal cramping and extreme fatigue about a year after she got the implant.

She said she felt so sick that she had to rely on her oldest child, then 8, to help with her three younger children.

""It was hard,"" she said.

Since the hysterectomy, her symptoms have almost completely gone away, she said.

Potts says she's angry that, in her memory, Basinski dismissed having her tubes tied, also known as tubal ligation, the other option for permanent female birth control.

She felt ""violated"" because she felt that her choice was taken away.

""I felt like it was Dr. Basinski's decision, more or less, because she said that this was best, and I wasn't really given another option,"" she said.

Basinski said she couldn't recall her conversation with Potts, but said she felt Potts was not remembering the conversation correctly. She said she routinely gives patients options for sterilization procedures.

""In my notes I did document that I talked about risks, benefits, and alternatives with her,"" Basinski said.

Another patient said Basinski also dismissed tubal ligation as an option in favor of Essure. That patient, who requested not to be named to protect her privacy, later went to a different doctor to have a hysterectomy to remove the device.

Basinski says that if it seems to her patients that she stresses Essure, that's only because it's a relatively new device -- it was approved by the FDA in 2002 -- and so it requires more explanation.

""We go through all of the options and all of the risks and benefits,"" she said. ""It is my obligation to offer patients all available products on the marketplace, explain the risks and benefits and why they may want to choose one or the other.""

But Potts and other patients say Basinski's marketing puts that claim into question. She's had YouTube videos, a website and a highway billboard all devoted to Essure.

In 2009, she appeared on ""The Balancing Act,"" a television show aimed at women, along with Trista Sutter, a former ""Bachelorette"" contestant who had been implanted with the device.

The host asked about the popularity and risks of Essure.

""Well, I'm going to tell you something, because of Miss Trista here, I think we're going to have women flocking to the doctor's office to get Essure,"" Basinski said. ""When women find out about this, they want this procedure.""

CNN spoke to two of her former patients who were pleased with Essure.

""Knowing Dr. Basinski, I don't believe that she would ever be biased in leading a patient towards something that she didn't feel was appropriate for them,"" said Cindy Dossett, who was implanted with Essure in 2008. ""I have always trusted her judgment. She has never given me any reason not to, and I wouldn't say that about all doctors.""

'That looks like a bribe'

In a statement to CNN, Bayer said that ""close cooperation with, and continuous education of, healthcare professionals is key to achieving better outcomes for the patients we strive to help.""

The statement added that health care professionals ""are compensated for their expertise and the services they provide to the pharmaceutical industry. It is appropriate and ethical for Bayer to compensate medical professionals for the time they spend on these activities.""

Friday Bayer provided CNN a document outlining the company's procedures for Essure related payments to outside medical experts. ""These agreements between Bayer and its consulting physicians do not compensate them for the use of Essure,"" it states. ""They are not being paid by Bayer to purchase, prescribe, or otherwise support Essure.""

Dr. Martin Makary, a professor of surgery and patient safety expert at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said that although it's ethical for a pharmaceutical company to pay a doctor for genuine research, he doubted that the more than 11,000 doctors paid by Bayer were involved in such efforts.

""That looks like a bribe,"" he said. ""That looks like gaming the system. That looks like the pharma company is paying off doctors.""

Data on Essure

The FDA estimates that Essure has been used by more than 750,000 patients worldwide since it was approved on November 4, 2002. At the time, Essure was manufactured and marketed by Conceptus Inc., which Bayer acquired in June 2013.

From 2002 through 2017, the patient problems most frequently reported to the FDA were pain/abdominal pain (21,215), heavier menses/menstrual irregularities (9,846), headache (7,231), fatigue (5,842) and weight fluctuations (4,970).

According to the FDA , reported adverse events ""cannot be interpreted or used in isolation to reach conclusions about the existence, severity or frequency of problems associated with devices"" and ""confirming whether a device actually caused a specific event can be difficult based solely on information provided in a given report.""

In April, the FDA restricted sales of Essure to only doctors who give patients FDA-approved patient education materials that describe the risks.

Basinski says she wishes women could keep getting Essure beyond the end of this year.

""I think it is a safe and viable option for women, and I'm very sad that it's not available in the marketplace after December of 2018 for women [for whom] this may be the right option,"" she said.

9d1adce91a7146b581a0aa732f90e334	['Jessica Ravitz', 'Cnn Design Annie Regan For Cnn']	2018-06-28 00:00:00	Two dads, an egg donor and a surrogate: How a freezer failure changed everything	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Two dads, an egg donor and a surrogate: How a freezer failure changed everything	1	"San Francisco, California (CNN) Their first date was over lunch during a Proposition 8 protest, where they joined hundreds of others railing against the passage of California's same-sex marriage ban. The two men took a break from demonstrating, threw their hearts on the table and talked about their desire to have kids.

So it was somehow appropriate that in June 2013, nearly five years later, Bill Taroli and Yang Li stood in a delivery room and welcomed their son, Henry, one day before the US Supreme Court overturned Prop 8. A couple weeks later, with their newborn in their arms, they exchanged vows and were legally married.

Having Henry required careful and complicated planning over the course of several years. To become fathers, they needed a support group, legal help, extensive research, reams of documents, reproductive science and about $150,000. But none of that mattered without the help of two women: an egg donor and a surrogate.

One embryo brought them Henry. Five remaining healthy embryos they kept frozen in storage at the Pacific Fertility Center in San Francisco. They imagined the sibling they might someday give their son and stayed in touch with the women who'd helped give them life once -- and might again someday.



Then came the news in March. A freezer or cryogenic storage tank at the facility failed, causing the level of liquid nitrogen to dip too low and the temperature to rise. The malfunction jeopardized the status of thousands of eggs and embryos inside, potentially crushing the dreams of hundreds of hopeful parents and families.

The fate of their embryos would prove significant not just for the fathers but for the women invested in their journey.

The eggs she wasn't using

Taroli, 47, was adopted by his stepfather and was 20 when he first met his biological dad. When he considered pathways to fatherhood, he was open to a variety of options.

Li, however, was keen on having a biological child, making the decision of how to proceed easy, Taroli said. Henry ""got his sperm and my name.""

They scrolled through a registry of possible egg donors provided by the fertility center, studying pictures and written statements. They settled on ""Isabelle,"" a name chosen by the potential donor, and elected to sit down with her in person.

She was a college student living in Sacramento when she spotted an ad about egg donation. She didn't need to do it financially, as she had family support and scholarships, but she liked the idea of extra spending money and looked ahead toward medical school and the enormous expenses to come.

Isabelle, the name she preferred to go by for this story, also thought about how fixated she was on not getting pregnant, and her mind turned to those who wanted nothing more.

""Some people are tying so hard to not have something that other people would absolutely love to have happen to them,"" she said by Skype from the United Kingdom, where she's beyond medical school and now doing her residency in Wales. ""I thought, 'I have these eggs. I'm not using them. Someone might as well.'""

She also liked the idea of taking part in social innovation and helping families who, without someone else's eggs, might never have children.

Isabelle's mother was befuddled by and against her daughter's decision to donate eggs.

""No, no, no -- don't do it,"" Isabelle remembered her pleading. ""What's the point?""

She ended up going through six egg donation cycles and received $7,000 to $8,000 each time, she said. She was fascinated by the science of it all. Her pre-med friends lined up to give her hormone injections.

Most of her donation cycles went directly to a frozen egg bank, where they'd be used by people she'd never know or meet. But her first cycle, the experience she appreciated most, went to two men who chose her.

She was excited to meet the people ""who wanted my eggs to be part of their family,"" she said. When they got together in the clinic offices, Taroli did most of the talking and peppered Isabelle with questions. Li, who didn't want to speak for this story, sat by with a clipboard, she remembered. The few questions Li asked were specific: He wanted to know what it was like to grow up bilingual and multicultural.

Isabelle, now 29, has a Portuguese mother and an American father. Henry has American and Chinese dads. And although their backgrounds are different from those of her parents, the couple saw in Isabelle a commonality. She walked away struck by their kindness and thinking how lucky any child of theirs would be.

Capable but 'not interested in carrying my own'

They came to know their embryos well, including their sexes, through chromosomal testing and biopsies of their cells. Taroli explained that they received rankings, which measured their viability, and the ones they stored -- including the one that would become Henry -- represented their best chances to become parents.

Next, Taroli and Li had to identify their surrogate.

A traditional surrogate is implanted with embryos using her own eggs, but Taroli and Li opted for a gestational carrier, a surrogate who receives through in-vitro fertilization an embryo using somebody else's eggs. The latter process, if they chose a carrier who also lived in California, would be less legally complicated for the gay dads, Taroli explained. The woman's name would not appear on Henry's birth certificate. Instead, both of their names would.

A few hours north of Castro Valley, the community in the East Bay where Taroli and Li live, the woman who would become their surrogate and her husband were happy to be parents to an only child. But she comes from a big family, in which the women generally have five or six kids, and her pregnancy had been ""really, really easy,"" she said.

An article she read about surrogacy got her thinking. Though pregnancy had been such a breeze for her, she knew that having a family was often a struggle for others. She thought about how some women feel attached to their babies while they're in the womb and how she didn't. It wasn't until after her son was born that she made a connection.

The surrogate asked to be identified as ""Audrey"" to protect her privacy.

""I felt emotionally capable of being a surrogate. I felt physically capable,"" Audrey said. ""It seems kind of a waste that I'm so able to carry children but not interested in carrying my own.""

Her husband, whom she's been with for more than 16 years, also didn't want more children but was in full support of this idea. His mother, Audrey said, was initially disappointed because she still held out hope that they'd give her more grandkids. Audrey's mother and grandmother, however, were completely on board.

It was her father, divorced from her mother and living several states away, who had the hardest time understanding. The thought of his daughter delivering somebody else's baby, and being part of a process that might include the destruction of embryos, went against his faith. But the two of them had weathered points of friction before, and Audrey, then 30, was prepared to move forward.

It wasn't about the money for her, although the $27,000 came in handy for the then stay-at-home mom.

She'd done research into how surrogacy worked and signed up with a surrogacy agency. There were questionnaires for her and her husband to complete, a psychological evaluation she had to clear and medical records that needed to be shared. She suspected that being a surrogate for a woman might become emotionally fraught and was most interested in being a surrogate for a gay couple. She also welcomed the chance to have an ongoing relationship after the birth.

The agency learned about Taroli and Li and set up a meeting.

With her husband and 3-year-old son with her, Audrey walked into the family-style restaurant the surrogacy agency had selected. It was initially awkward, sort of like heading into a blind date, she said.

""They brought me flowers, which was really sweet,"" she remembered. ""You could tell how much they were trying to impress me.""

Like her husband who works in IT, so does Taroli; Li is in software development. Their initial shyness was something she understood and liked. As they warmed up, they shared their histories, and the two men spoke openly about their hope to be fathers. They told her that they liked the idea of staying in contact with their surrogate, not just during the pregnancy but after, a proposition that made her smile.

She left feeling like, in them, she'd found her match.

'Not just a vessel for their child'

After some additional testing at the fertility center, Audrey and the couple began to iron out a legal contract.

She laid out what she was -- and wasn't -- comfortable with. She wanted to pick her own doctor and hospital. No more than two embryos could be implanted in her, she said, and she was relieved when they decided to go with just one. She planned to work with a doula, did not want an epidural and would consider a cesarean section only if the doctor deemed it necessary.

Eating healthy foods and not smoking were conditions she already chose to live by. And she and her husband would abstain from sexual intercourse in the weeks right before and after the embryo transfer, to make sure she was having Taroli and Li's baby -- not hers.

For many people, in vitro fertilization requires repeated tries -- and additional costs -- to work, if it works at all. The first embryo implanted in Audrey took without a hitch.

She, Taroli and Li were in touch by email a few times a week, and the dads came along to some of her doctor appointments. They got together at least once a month and came to know each other as her belly grew. Sometimes when they'd visit, the two men would take her and her family out to dinner.

""They really valued me,"" Audrey said. ""They saw me as a person, not just a vessel for their child.""

She recalled how her own child took the developments in stride. When he was nearly 4 and she was very pregnant, someone asked her son, ""Aren't you excited you're going to be a brother?""

The young boy answered, without skipping a beat, ""That's not going to be my brother. That's Bill and Yang's baby.""

As her contractions grew stronger in the Redding delivery room, she held off on pushing and screamed out, ""Are the dads here? Are they here?"" A nurse rushed Taroli and Li in from the waiting room. They were there to witness Henry's arrival and cut his umbilical cord.

Audrey and her husband, who was also in the room, watched as the two new dads fussed with how to put on the first diaper.

""They were so funny,"" Audrey, now 36, remembered. ""They were being a little snippy with each other. I'm sure I was like that with my son, and it was so cute to see that in someone else.""

Audrey pumped breast milk for Henry for 10 months and stopped sending the UPS shipments on dry ice only once Taroli and Li had enough to get them through their son's first year.

She and her family visited Henry's family quite a bit in the beginning. They saw them on Christmas and were at the boy's first birthday party. They've since moved to Los Angeles, where Audrey works as a speech therapist. It's been a couple years since they've seen each other, but they still get updates and pictures.

'He's not my son'

Isabelle and Audrey have not met but have heard about each other. They each received photo books Taroli and Li created to document Henry's first year and how he came into this world. They receive updates and additional photographs, still. And, as a result, they've seen pictures of one another, as they're both central to Henry's story.

Isabelle remembers being a little thrown by the first photograph she spotted of Audrey.

""I remember thinking, she had my egg inside of her,"" she said. ""That's just crazy.""

Isabelle didn't see Taroli and Li again until Henry was about a 1½. The couple reached out to the clinic to say they wanted her to meet Henry.

""I wanted him to have the opportunity to know who was involved in his coming into being,"" said Taroli, who didn't learn that he was adopted until he was 14.

The clinic, in turn, put the query to Isabelle. She was living in the UK at the time but would be returning to California for Christmas.

Isabelle's mother, who had opposed her daughter's decision to donate eggs, suddenly couldn't wait for her chance to meet the boy.

That would come later. The first visit with Taroli, Li and Henry was Isabelle's alone.

As she drove across the Golden Gate Bridge, she began to grow nervous. She was fresh off a breakup, emotionally raw and worried that she might see Henry and suddenly want him. She feared that she'd lay eyes on him and believe, ""This is my baby,"" she said.

""But then, when I got there and I saw Henry, he couldn't have cared less,"" she said with a laugh. ""I was just another person in the room. Yes, he's genetically my son, but he's not my son. He was more interested in the tissue box than me.""

She tries to see them whenever she's in California and appreciates the photos they send her. Her mother gushes over pictures of Henry and ""is probably more attached to him than I am,"" Isabelle said.

Sometimes she wonders, if Taroli and Li had had a girl, whether she would have seen herself more in the child. She knew that there was a female embryo in the tank and thought about what might come later.

Taroli and Li told her, at one point, that if she ever found herself single or struggling to get pregnant, she was welcome to use embryos they didn't use.

""It would be quite ironic, wouldn't it?"" asked Isabelle, who faces years of continued medical training and hopes to be an obstetrician-gynecologist some day. The option of using their embryos, if she needed them someday, stayed in the back of her mind.

An ocean between them

Taroli was texting with his mom, with his television on in the background, when a national story caught his eye. He recognized the lobby of the Pacific Fertility Clinic but thought it was just generic footage, he said, to complement a report on a failed fertility clinic storage tank in Cleveland, Ohio.

He had to rewind and watch the piece three or four times before the truth sunk in. The very same weekend that Cleveland experienced a tank malfunction, so did San Francisco.

He fired off an email to the fertility clinic, not knowing whether this freezer failure affected them. Li, who is establishing a new business in China, was abroad, so Taroli sent him a message, too, with a link to the TV segment.

A day or two later, Taroli said, he got a late evening call from the clinic, confirming that their embryos were in the ill-fated tank. To find out whether the embryos were destroyed, however, would take further testing.

To test an embryo requires that it be thawed first, which -- in turn -- might damage the embryo, Taroli explained. He and Li decided they would approve testing, one embryo at a time. If the first was still OK, they could hope that the others were, too.

""So we did that,"" Taroli said over coffee in April. ""They all came back dead.""

With thousands of miles and the Pacific Ocean between them, the couple processed what this meant for them.

""They were viable lives. They were potential babies, four boys and a girl, that if we chose to could have been our kids,"" Taroli said. ""It's not about the death of a child; it's not the same thing. ... It's the death of the possibility.""

And it's the death of what might have been for Henry, who'd lost the chance to have biological siblings.

Taroli was playing the role of solo parent during Li's China trip. He got choked up when he spoke about their son, who recently turned 5, and the extra big hugs he was getting.

""If I get upset, he cries,"" Taroli said. ""I've been careful not to talk about it in front of him.""

Breaking the news

It was important to Taroli to break the news to Isabelle and Audrey. They were part of the fertility journey from the start, and they deserved to know how it ended.

Before he got to Isabelle, though, she got an email from the Pacific Fertility Clinic. The clinic wanted to know, out of the blue, whether she'd be open to donating eggs again. She explained where she now lived but said she'd be interested if they wanted to talk. She got a call almost immediately.

If the clinic wanted to fly her to California or could wait until she was there for a visit, she said, she'd be willing to go through a donation cycle, she said. She was told they'd reach out again if they needed her.

The exchange got her thinking about Henry and her experience. She talked to a friend about it that night and wondered aloud about how big Henry must be.

When she woke up at 4 a.m., she said, she had an email from Taroli, telling her about the storage tank failure. She began to wonder whether the clinic had only called her because it had lost her eggs and their embryos. Taroli too found the timing odd. Why would they reach out to Isabelle without knowing whether he and Li were even interested in going through this again, he wondered.

The clinic, contacted several times for clarification on this and other questions, would not comment for this story.

The news of the lost embryos both shocked and saddened Isabelle.

""For some reason, I kept thinking about the little girl egg,"" she said, and the potential that was lost for all the embryos. ""They would never become people. But then, I guess, we always knew that they wouldn't all ever become real people, right?""

Isabelle told Taroli that if he and Li ever wanted to try again, her eggs were theirs.

Audrey's heart sunk too for the couple when she got the news from Taroli. She knew from a previous conversation that they were on the fence about when -- or if -- they'd have a second child, but she hated that the option was taken away from them.

Because her experience with Taroli and Li was so wonderful, Audrey went on to be a gestational carrier once more a few years later. But the second time she did it for an opposite-sex couple, and the experience was awful in comparison. That couple demanded that doctors speak only to them and wanted to manage all aspects of her life. Audrey felt like nothing more than a vessel.

After that, she said, she couldn't imagine being a surrogate again -- unless it was for Taroli and Li.

""They were so great, and I love them so much,"" Audrey said. ""I would do it a million times over again for them.""

Taroli and Li knew this.

'Happy with where we are'

Pacific Fertility Center formally offered to cover all costs for another round, and their doctor, whom they don't blame in any way, was eager to have them go through the process again.

But Taroli and Li, after processing the shock, mourning the loss and coming to terms with where their lives are now, have decided they aren't interested in going through this again.

They're getting older, they love their life with Henry, Li's new business in China will require lots of travel and time apart, and now is not the time for them to have more children.

The truth is, they may have never used those embryos, but they would have liked to make that decision on their own terms.

""If we were really eager to have a second child still or didn't have Henry yet, our thinking might have been different,"" Taroli said. ""We're happy with where we are.""

Meantime, attorneys are signing on clients for lawsuits against the clinic, but Taroli said they can't imagine dragging this out. They don't need to take part to find closure. Yes, they want to understand what went wrong with the tank that held their embryos, most of all because they want to be sure it doesn't happen again.

""I work in tech, where lives aren't on the line,"" Taroli said. ""You improve your process and put something better in place until the next thing you couldn't anticipate happens.""

He doesn't judge those who are seeking legal remedies, and he knows that for some, for instance those who froze embryos before undergoing treatment for cancer, what happened is a tragedy of different proportions.

But for him and Li, they will love the child they do have, stay honest with Henry about where he came from and give him every chance to know the women who helped him get here.

And someday, when the time is right and he asks why he never had siblings, they'll find the words to explain."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180622143805-sf-dads-egg-donor-main-super-tease.jpg
0470ac10dad74279806a11ede5d3971f	['Wayne Drash']	2018-06-12 00:00:00	Medicine for her diabetes kept her alive -- and it was killing her, too	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Medicine for her diabetes kept her alive -- and it was killing her, too	1	"Columbia, South Carolina (CNN) Emmy Reeves shows off the My Little Pony mural she painted in her sister's room.

She points out other displays of her work around the family home: a portrait of a cat, a painting of a hillside overlooking Lake Superior, a small sculpture of her riding a wolf.

At 13, Emmy has undergone an awakening.

Just months ago, she struggled with the rarest of conditions: She was a child with Type 1 diabetes who was allergic to the insulin shots she needed to stay alive.

She was given an array of antihistamines to dampen her allergic reactions as a means of survival. But the result was that she slept about 20 hours a day -- and the possibility of dying from her daily insulin remained.

The very medicine she needed to stay alive was slowly killing her.

""It's horrifying to know that every day, you would give your child a medicine that, in essence, could kill them,"" mother Tiffanie Reeves said. ""It's just really scary.""

For Emmy, every insulin injection felt like fire spreading through her body, from her fingertips to her toes. When her parents tried to hug her, she'd flinch because the pain was unbearable.

The first time she was given an insulin shot, she stopped breathing, fainted and was rushed to the hospital. She was just 4 years old. In the months after, her parents held her down for every insulin shot. She'd scream and shout, ""I'll be a good girl!""

""We have to do this because we love you. This is what keeps you alive,"" her parents would say.

For nine years, she suffered like this. Beyond the pain, she developed cataracts and often broke out into extreme rashes. She was medicated so much, she struggled with memory and an array of other issues.

Her parents tried everything. They took Emmy to top medical institutions and spoke with insulin companies to get the least amount of preservatives in her insulin, because that's what they believed was causing the allergic reactions. Nothing seemed to work.

Desperate, her father wrote an email last year to Dr. Raja Kandaswamy, one of the nation's pre-eminent pancreas transplant surgeons. ""Her quality of life is degrading faster than we had hoped, so now we are looking for a solution that will allow her to stop needing insulin, while we find a solution to her allergy,"" Jack Reeves wrote.

More than 1 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition that destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar to enter cells to produce energy. For most children, the condition is managed through insulin injections and a close monitoring of their blood sugar levels. It is exceedingly rare for a child to have an insulin allergy on the magnitude as Emmy.

Emmy's father wasn't looking for a cure for her diabetes. He was simply hoping to give his daughter an improved quality of life to help manage her diabetes. Her parents feared that she would die within a year if she stayed on the same course of treatment.

Emmy Reeves holds her cat and a stuffed pancreas. She recently underwent a pancreas transplant that has transformed her life.

But that email set in motion a chain of events, resulting in the nation's sole pancreas transplant of a child this young in nearly 25 years. It also led to his daughter being cured of her diabetes.

""It's amazing. She's a totally different child,"" her mother said. ""Every day that she does not reject this organ, I'm going to hug her, even though she may get tired of Mommy hugging her.""

'You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling'

Kandaswamy, the director of the pancreas transplant program at University of Minnesota Health, remembers receiving the email from Emmy's father ""like it was yesterday.""

Kandaswamy, who has two daughters himself, felt the pain of a father who desperately wanted help for his child. But there was little medical literature to guide or support a pancreatic transplant in a child. There have been other cases in which children receive a new pancreas, but those transplants are usually done in conjunction with kidney and intestine transplants.

Only nine children have received a sole pancreas transplant, Kandaswamy said. The last time a pancreas transplant was done in a child this young, he said, was nearly 25 years ago. That transplant was performed at the University of Minnesota in 1994 on an 11-year-old boy by Kandaswamy's mentor, Dr. David Sutherland, who is considered the father of pancreatic transplants. Unfortunately, that pancreas only lasted six months in the boy.

""Pancreas transplants are generally just not done on children,"" Kandaswamy said.

But his mentor taught him to always put a loved one in that patient's place and ask yourself, "" 'What would you do if it was your mother or your daughter who needed the care?' Ask that question, and you will get your answer.""

Kandaswamy said that's exactly what he did when Emmy first visited. ""I have two daughters of my own. One of them is very close in age to Emmy,"" he said. ""Looking at her, you could see: 'Hey, if this was your daughter, what would you do?'

""You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling,"" said Kandaswamy, who is also a professor in the department of surgery at the university's medical school. ""Her quality of life was just deteriorating to the point that this was a cycle that would not be compatible for long-term survival.""

He had to educate others in the hospital about why he felt the transplant would work for a child. The university had a new pediatric hospital, and if the surgery didn't go as planned, the institution's reputation could be adversely impacted.

""There was a huge amount of apprehension,"" Kandaswamy said. ""I knew we were taking a big risk in that this may not go well.""

A team of more than a dozen doctors was put together to study Emmy's case: surgeons, anesthesiologists, nephrologists, allergists, transplant coordinators, pain management specialists and others.

After a four-day assessment in April 2017 at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital, they agreed that a full pancreas transplant was the best option of giving her a better quality of life.

""We didn't make the decision without due thought and process,"" Kandaswamy said. ""We had to do it because of the extenuating circumstances here.""

Kandaswamy felt that in the nearly 25 years since that first pancreas transplant on a child, the surgical techniques and post-transplant management have advanced to the point that his team could ""successfully perform a transplant in a child this young.""

A healthy pancreas would allow her body to naturally produce insulin -- effectively curing her diabetes -- but the surgery carried many risks, including the possibility her body would reject the organ.

""Pediatric patients, they have very active immune systems, and they will try to spit out any kind of organ,"" Kandaswamy said.

Emmy and her mother would also need to move to Minnesota from South Carolina to be near the hospital the moment a pancreas became available.

Before she headed north, though, Emmy created a bucket list: eat jambalaya in Louisiana, feast on a steak in Texas, visit the Grand Canyon and see her friends from diabetes camp in California, where she once lived.

The family hit the road. Emmy got to do everything on her list.

It was, her parents say, a farewell trip, should she not survive.

False alarms and the magic moment

Emmy and her mother arrived in Minnesota on July 15. They settled into the Ronald McDonald House, where families stay for free during visits at the hospital. They then had to wait for a pancreas to become available.

Three times, the calls came that an organ might be available. Each time turned out to be a false alarm. The second was on Thanksgiving.

At one low point, Emmy suffered a severe allergic reaction in January; she stopped breathing and had to be rushed into emergency care. Still, she battled on.

Then came the moment. On the afternoon of February 9, Kandaswamy called Emmy's mother with news that a pancreas was available. Emmy was watching a documentary about wolves, her favorite animal, with her tutor at a museum.

Mom let her finish watching the film and then told her it was time. They needed to rush back, gather up some belongings and get to the hospital. When they got to the Ronald McDonald House, the place was abuzz. Word had spread like wildfire that Emmy's moment had arrived. Families and staff cheered them on and wished them well.

At the hospital, Kandaswamy greeted them in the lobby. He explained that a procurement team had gone to get the organ about an hour away in St. Cloud -- that there was still a possibility it might not be a proper fit but that he was optimistic.

Emmy's mother, Tiffanie Reeves, clutched Ducky throughout the transplant. The stuffed animal was given to Emmy when she was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.

Emmy was prepped for the surgery so she would be ready when the pancreas arrived.

About 3 a.m., Kandaswamy conferenced in Jack, who was back in South Carolina with Emmy's younger sister. ""I think we are going to go ahead. The organ looks good,"" he said.

On Emmy's 210th day in Minnesota, the transplant began. That number isn't lost on the family: She was wheeled into the operating room on 2/10.

As Emmy underwent surgery, Mom clutched a tattered yellow stuffed animal named Ducky, who was given to Emmy after she was diagnosed with diabetes.

The surgery took more than four hours. ""It was a great, great feeling when we got her done,"" Kandaswamy said. ""But I knew in my mind that the job was only half done. We were excited but also cautiously optimistic at that point.""

The doctors had to make sure the new pancreas -- what Emmy nicknamed ""Player 2"" -- worked properly, that her body didn't reject it and that her body could tolerate the immunosuppressive drugs she needed after the transplant.

She responded well the first week, but in the second week after the transplant, her body began to reject the organ. Her immune system saw it as foreign and tried to attack it.

""I had to come and tell her that her body is in rejection,"" her mother said. ""We're not sure what's going to happen in the future.""

They decided to try a stronger immunosuppressant. ""We're already down the rabbit hole, Mom. We gotta do what we gotta do,"" Emmy said.

Ever since, her pancreas has functioned as hoped.

Dr. Melina Bellin, the pediatric endocrinologist with University of Minnesota Health who worked with Emmy, said it was ""touch-and-go"" early on, but everyone was relieved when Emmy's health turned around.

""It's particularly rewarding when you're at that point in the beginning when you're not 100% sure it's going to turn out the way you wanted,"" she said. ""It definitely makes it that much better when it does.""

Kandaswamy added, ""We were able to treat it effectively and got it turned around.""

With the healthy new pancreas, he said, her diabetes has been cured. She no longer needs insulin shots or the antihistamines that she was taking to try to limit her allergic reactions. The hospital slowly weaned her off all of those medications that were making her extremely drowsy and ""blunting her consciousness,"" Kandaswamy said.

""Then we saw the real Emmy. She started really blossoming,"" he said. ""It's like a cloud has been lifted off her consciousness so she can actually express all of this stuff in a big way.""

One of the greatest moments of his career, Kandaswamy said, was when Emmy hugged him: ""There was nothing more fulfilling than seeing her walk up, give me a hug and say, 'I want to go back home.' It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.""

Pancreas transplants are not recommended for most children with diabetes, but Kandaswamy said he hopes this case will open the way for children with rare conditions like Emmy who could benefit from a pancreas transplant. ""I think this will be an index case that will help spark that awareness,"" he said.

Speaking up to help others

In the family home in Columbia, South Carolina, Jack and Tiffanie Reeves are still in near disbelief at how well Emmy is doing. She's thriving in ways they could only dream of. Beyond her artwork, she's started playing the piano. She can go on hikes. She can shoot hoops. She can play with her younger sister, Abby.

Emmy Reeves shows off the mural she painted in her sister's room after her transplant.

""She's getting a childhood, finally. She's getting to be able to be a kid,"" her mother said. ""I mean, this child's achieved so much in just the three months since transplant. It's going to be pretty incredible to get to see what she'll be able to do in the next few years.""

The family agreed to tell Emmy's story in hopes that it can help other children suffering as she did. They know of four young children around the world with a similar insulin allergy as she.

""If our experience could help even one kid, I think it would be worth it,"" Tiffanie said.

Emmy is not out of the woods. The first year after a transplant is especially critical. Her body could still reject the organ. The family tries not to dwell on that. ""We still live life, and we don't let the worry and stress of that keep us and our daughters from living the life that we need to,"" her father said.

Emmy hopes to be a zoologist one day.

f901d173d6384a2396e46cf3f011fc1d	['David G. Allan']	2018-05-26 00:00:00	Murderer's prison escape inspired a near-impossible ultramarathon	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Murderer's prison escape inspired a near-impossible ultramarathon	1	"Petros, Tennessee (CNN) Fifty years ago, a career criminal named James Earl Ray traveled from Atlanta to Memphis, stalking the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader was there to energize a strike of sanitation workers asking for better working conditions and higher pay. Ray was there to assassinate him.

While King stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel (now a museum for peace), Ray accomplished his sinister goal with a single shot from more than 200 feet away.

Over the next two months, while on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives List, Ray was on the run, traveling to Europe on a false passport. He was eventually caught at London's Heathrow Airport. He pleaded guilty to avoid a jury trial and the death penalty, was sentenced to 99 years and sent to Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in eastern Tennessee, surrounded by thick wooded hills.

In its day, it was considered one of the toughest state prisons, where inmates frequently killed each other. In the novel ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" Dr. Hannibal Lecter negotiates a transfer to the prison.

Brushy was also nearly impossible to escape, but Ray managed it with the help of six other convicts in 1977. All were recaptured within days, though ""rescued"" is probably the better description. Cold, hunger and disorientation brought them to their knees, and their own fiction-worthy plot turned from ""The Great Escape"" to ""Blair Witch Project.""

Ray himself traveled only 8 miles in a little over two days, a detail that made one local long-distance runner, Gary Cantrell, think to himself that he could make it 100 miles in that amount of time.

And thus the seed of the Barkley Marathons was planted.

Man vs. land

Cantrell, whose nickname is ""Lazarus Lake,"" or ""Laz"" as he is known by everyone, was further inspired to start his own race by this rugged land he knew so well. The name ""brushy"" is fitting for a rural area thick with undergrowth, briars and hidden obstacles that inflict cuts, bruises and falls. It's so dense, you can't see the top of any of the peaks from the bottom.

These mountains, where a day hike can be a challenge, are where truly competitive racing should be held, he thought, not on a flat, paved, well-marked course.

The Barkley consists of five loops of 20 miles each (though runners swear it's more like a marathon-length 26 miles). All told, it has about 67,000 feet of elevation -- from sea level to the peak of Mount Everest is 29,000 feet -- not that the other 67,000 feet of descent are much easier.

The loops are run back to back over three sleepless days and nights, on unmarked trails. Runners must trace the course from a topographical map hours before the race begins. Most other distance races -- with their clear routes, aid stations, teams of helpful volunteers and throngs of encouraging spectators -- are designed so racers finish, but the Barkley is designed so racers fail.

And fail they do. Of more than 1,000 who've entered, only 15 have completed the full distance in time. ""It's a good place for your ego to take a beating,"" Laz said before this year's race, sporting a red beanie labeled ""Geezer."" His insightful quips are often followed by a cackle of delight, like the Yoda of the runner's world.

Among ultramarathoners, the Barkley is considered one of the hardest -- a superlative that is subjective, of course. There are footraces that cross deserts, traverse tall mountains and even go greater distances than Barkley's 100 or 130 or so miles. But it's the unique combination of impediments, punishing conditions and lack of assistance that makes this race the stuff of legend. It's even the subject of a documentary; a cameraman had to be rescued by rangers more than 12 hours after he got lost.

It's only in the face of such opposition that the highest peak physical and mental experiences are achieved. That's the idea, anyway. Among ultramarathoners and elite trail runners, the Barkley is the Holy Grail of races.

How it works (or doesn't)

For a competition that thumbs its nose at conventional rules, this anti-race race does have a number of parameters in which it operates (not written down, of course), all to maximize the challenge. Some of the choice unwritten rules include:

No GPS or phones.

The only permitted technology is a cheap watch from Walmart, handed out by Laz to each runner and synchronized to his watch. Unmanned checkpoints (13 this year), which are paperback books.

You rip out the page that corresponds to your bib number to prove that you reached it. You must have all the book pages in hand at the end of each loop. The books are hidden under rocks or taped to trees, usually. 60-hour cutoff. Two years ago, Gary Robbins got turned around in his exhaustion with only 2 miles to go, arriving at the campground a few seconds over time, disqualified not just for missing the time cutoff but for going off-route.

Two years ago, Gary Robbins got turned around in his exhaustion with only 2 miles to go, arriving at the campground a few seconds over time, disqualified not just for missing the time cutoff but for going off-route. No aid stations. Philosophical Laz: ""Being totally free doesn't come without risk.""

Philosophical Laz: ""Being totally free doesn't come without risk."" No outside assistance.

No friends and family to meet you with food or socks except at the camp between loops. No hints as to the location of checkpoints or map secrets. This year's theme, according to cackling Yoda-esque Laz: ""Help is not coming."" Start time TBD.

A conch is blown one hour before the race starts, but that can be anywhere between midnight and noon. ""The uncertainty is half the fun,"" Laz said with a chortle, ""and one of the hardest things to deal with."" Entry fee is $1.60, a pair of socks (this year) and an essay. Other ultras charge hundreds of dollars, but Laz isn't in it for the money, though he's partial to a specific brand of dress sock.

Thousands apply every year, and only 40 are chosen. Just figuring out how to apply is a challenge: There's no website, email or physical address posted anywhere.

Laz, as he is known by everyone, was inspired to create the Barkley Marathons by the local land and a prison escape by Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassin.

Would-be runners write an essay on why they should be allowed to compete, and Laz chooses among these, factoring in their arguments or, in some cases, poetry but also their proven ability to endure. Finishers tend to have bona fides that include setting speed records on famous long-distance national trails or climbing the highest peaks in the world. If accepted, runners get a ""letter of condolence"" and told the date of the race (also a secret), and they must bring a license plate of some variety to the race site that are strung up in walls of metallic memory.

'Good luck, morons'

This year's lucky (or maybe unlucky) runners -- 31 men, nine women -- gathered on a chilly April evening at a campground at Frozen Head State Park the day before the race. A single copy of the course map sat on a table as runners took turns tracing the route on their own topographical maps. The route changes in parts from year to year, and sometimes a peak is added. Veterans know to laminate them in clear tape to avoid disintegration from the elements.

Four or five pages of Laz's enigmatic and wry instructions are also handed out. These mainly help runners find the checkpoint books, which often have tongue-in-cheek titles such as ""Where Do We Go From Here"" and ""A Time to Die."" I asked one runner whether I could take a quick look at the instructions, and he seemed wary of handing over such well-kept secrets to a representative of a global media organization. One (non-identifiable) passage read, ""You will be able to make out the trail that climbs directly to pulloff, unless it is foggy, then you will have to guess.""

Chicken and beans, cooked over an open fire, were served as part of a potluck the evening before the race started. There is little to no alcohol, as that's not conducive to running 100-plus miles. Runners greet each other warmly and exchange war stories of past Barkleys. It's a rarified club to which they belong. A cake read, ""Good luck, morons.""

Because you don't know when the race is going to start, it makes for a fitful night's sleep, lest you miss the sound of the conch. This sleep-depriving FOMO was exacerbated by the cacophony of heavy rain pounding on the tents most of the night.

Mercifully, or just randomly, Laz gave everyone a full night of whatever sleep they could get, and the conch was blown at 8:30 a.m., under clear skies. When runners gathered an hour later to start, Laz gave few remarks, none particularly encouraging. After reading the names of Barkley veterans who died over the years, Laz removed his hat, and a bugler played taps, the traditional song of military funerals.

Tradition dictates that the start of the race is signaled by Laz lighting a Camel cigarette. Runners started trotting past him as he made his first exhale. The course begins with a steady incline that will reach 1,600 feet of elevation within just the first mile and a half or, as Laz described it, ""the easiest hill they'll do all day. After that, it turns ugly.""

Although he's done his fair share of endurance running (including a 318-mile course) and long-distance hiking (he's currently walking from Tennessee to Oregon), Laz has never competed in the Barkley himself. Neither has his friend Barry Barkley, for whom he named the race.

'4/5 Pure Joy, 1/5 Pure Hell'

The details of the race are a well-guarded secret, and they won't be divulged here. The names of landmarks in the instructions -- Quitter's Road, Rat Jaw -- don't correspond to labels on any official map.

The one portion that's not a secret is Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary, which closed for prison business in 2009. Barkley runners jump into a creek and wade through a tunnel that goes under the jail, emerging just steps away from the wall that Ray and his fellow escapees jumped. You can arrange a tour inside the crumbling prison. Ray's cell was No. 27. My guide repeated that the place is haunted without a wink or any indication that she was kidding.

The race takes place every spring, a season when weather fluctuates from warm and muggy one hour to freezing and wet the next. Some years, there has been snow to run through and temperatures 10 degrees below freezing.

""This is the only place you can have 45-mile-per-hour winds and pea soup fog,"" Laz said, pausing for his punch line: ""at the same time."" This year, it started pleasantly cool and cloudy, but rain and cold punished them as the hours went by.

Between each loop, runners will eat, doctor their feet, maybe steal a quick nap. Some rest at base camp as little at 15 minutes, others an hour before being given a new bib number (to get a new page from the checkpoints). The direction of the race changes between loops as well, adding another level of difficulty and more orienteering. In the first four loops, two are clockwise, two counter-clockwise. If more than one runner makes it to the fifth loop, each runner is sent in opposing directions for the final marathon.

No one made it past three loops this year. Just over half made it to the second loop, five made it to the third loop, and only one finished the third. As racers dropped out, a bugler played taps. Like some previous years, it was played 40 times. Laz thought two factors that led to the lack of finishers this year were the weather and that he chose fewer Barkley veterans than usual.

Finishing is so rare, there is a web page of quotes on what the experience was like. Brett Maune, 2011's only finisher, calculated ""4/5 Pure Joy, 1/5 Pure Hell.""

Andrew Thompson finished in 2009, after setting the speed record for the 2,160-mile Appalachian Trail in 47½ days. ""Finishing [the Barkley] was not at all what I expected,"" he wrote. ""All the emotion and hoopla and sense of accomplishment with which I had begun Loop 5 were quickly worn down to nubs. The 'victory' lap quickly turned into survival mode. I was sick, and cold, and damn happy to be done.""

Only one person, Jared Campbell, has finished the race three times. ""I am thrilled,"" he said after finishing in 2016, ""setting a new personal standard for how much adventure I can extract out of $1.60."" In 2014, he was more philosophical: ""There are lessons in life that can only be learned through fairly massive deviations from our normal, comfortable routines. They can sharpen our optimism and generate a deeper appreciation for the simple things in life."" And in 2012, he was nearly psychedelic: ""Due to some extreme foot pain (skin) and sleep deprivation I experienced an incredible distillation of my physical and mental self down to a few basic senses and thoughts, which was both an educational and beautiful experience.""

In 2013, finisher Nickademus Hollon quoted Plato: ""The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself.""

'A different breed'

To reach the Barkley, you will have done massive amounts of trail and endurance running -- even for the annual ""human sacrifice,"" as Laz playfully labels one person who he predicts doesn't have the right stuff.

But if you're just getting into trail running or adventure racing, you have to put in your vertical hours. Many long-distance runners train in intervals, also known as periodization, building strength by alternating hard and easy weeks of exertion and recovery. Most of the runners in the Barkley run ultra-distances year-round so don't need a training program that starts with short runs.

In the case of the Barkley or other unmarked trail races, it is also essential to be able to read a topographical map, something of a dying skill as technology and a lack of wooded adventure rob us of it.

Unlike the documentary crew member and King's killer, no Barkley runner has ever got so lost in the area's woods (Laz: ""100% self-extraction"") that they needed rescuing before they faced starvation or hypothermia.

Although GPS devices aren't allowed in the Barkley, plenty of other gear is, including compasses, walking sticks and trail running backpacks with food and water. Many long-distance runners prefer quality, thick-soled shoes; a light but warm jacket for nights and peaks; a hydration pack; portable food; salt tablets; and a powerful headlamp for night running. Unlike other ultramarathons, this one does not have gear requirements. These runners know what they're doing.

Training in the sport also includes learning how to avoid injuries, but that's not always possible. Injuries such as cuts and sprains are typical on the Barkley, but nothing has ever halted a runner in their tracks. The worst injury was a kneecap that ""snapped in two,"" Laz said, and the runner still finished the loop. ""It's a different breed,"" he cackled.

though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. Among the 1,212 active ultrarunners in the study, injuries were also more prevalent among younger (under age 40), less-experienced runners. Most (64.6%) reported an exercise-related injury that resulted in lost training days over the previous year, but that didn't translate to additional missed days at work. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures. Ultrarunners suffer about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners, according to a recent study by the University of California, Davis and Stanford University,though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. Among the 1,212 active ultrarunners in the study, injuries were also more prevalent among younger (under age 40), less-experienced runners. Most (64.6%) reported an exercise-related injury that resulted in lost training days over the previous year, but that didn't translate to additional missed days at work. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.

That study also found that while ultrarunners tended to be older than the general running population, they had fewer incidents of heart disease and other chronic conditions. They were more likely than the general population to have allergies, hay fever and exercise-induced asthma, probably due to high levels of exposure to pollen-gifting nature. In general, running is outstanding cardio exercise, benefiting much of the body and tied to greater health outcomes than the general population.

As for the mental rewards -- well, that's a journey that is as unique as the individual and certainly not guaranteed. A ""sense of accomplishment"" is an expression that grossly undersells the thrill of finishing a race as special and difficult at the Barkley. And yet to get to whatever personal heaven awaits you at the finish line, it most certainly means going through hell to get there."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180521182224-10-barkley-marathons-fit-nation-super-tease.jpg

When she was 9, Shalom and her younger sister were napping under a table at their mother's restaurant in Nigeria. Her mom, unaware of the sleeping girls below, placed a pot of hot oil on the table. Someone accidentally knocked the pot over, scalding the sisters.

The girls were rushed to the hospital, severely burned. Eventually, an aunt got them visas so they could come to the United States and undergo several surgeries.

Shalom Blac was burned in a kitchen accident when she was 9 years old.

After the accident, Shalom's life took a ""huge, huge turn.""

""Kids that I used to play with, they were either scared of me or some would call me 'monster' and 'two-face' and just laugh. I started thinking about committing suicide because of the bullying.""

As a little girl, Shalom loved playing with her mother's makeup. But she first learned how to properly wear it during her hospital stay in the United States.

""They were teaching me how to do makeup even though I wasn't good. I used to just have concealer all over my face and go to school. It was horrible.""

Then, one day while watching YouTube, she came across cosmetics tutorials that changed her life.

""That's how I picked up on how to do a lot of different stuff. And I started applying that to how I want my makeup to look and how I want to look with makeup. ""

A girl in one particular YouTube video really struck a nerve.

""She was a young girl who was battling cancer, and she was completely bald. I was just like, 'Oh, my, how is she so young and so brave to come on camera in a public place?' So I just decided to challenge myself and do the thing that scares me the most.""

Shalom started making her own YouTube videos. Without makeup, she let the world see her as she is, scars and all.

""I just decided to do a video and then post a picture of me without my wig, which was a big deal. I was so scared, but seeing people tell me how my picture or my videos have inspired them really pushed me to do more and share with people.""

Shalom Blac is known for her transformative makeup videos on YouTube and Instagram.

1505d2da3ebf41c394b880fe9f6a8130	['Wayne Drash']	2018-05-13 00:00:00	A dying mother's plea for her life	https://www.cnn.com/	US	A dying mother's plea for her life	1	"Portland, Oregon (CNN) All Erika Zak wants to do is play with her daughter on the playground. Take her to the zoo. Walk her to school.

She's never been able to be the mother she longs to be.

At 38, Erika is dying.

Her battle to live began almost as soon as her daughter, Loïe, was born four years ago, when Erika was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver.

The cancer was removed from her colon and, her doctors say, she responded well to treatment. But a microwave ablation surgery last year to remove two tumors from her liver went terribly wrong, leaving a fist-sized hole in her liver and destroying her bile ducts.

Every day since has been a fight to survive. She's been hospitalized 19 times in Oregon over the last 12 months for infections, bleeding and an array of other health issues.

She has high blood pressure in her liver, which backs up the veins in her esophagus and can be catastrophic. Her surgical oncologist constantly worries she will fall ill with a bad infection and die.

Without a liver transplant, her doctors say Erika will likely die before the end of the year.

""Every time she calls me and has a fever and some bleeding, we all hold our breath, worried: Will this be the time Erika bleeds to death?"" says Dr. Skye Mayo, her surgical oncologist at Oregon Health & Science University.

""This is kind of the end game of what liver failure looks like.""

More than 100 doctors at three of the nation's top medical centers have weighed in on her case, which is complex and exceedingly rare. Their conclusion: The only way to save Erika's life is to give her a new liver.

After weeks of evaluation at the Cleveland Clinic in December and January, Erika finally got her big break.

On February 2, doctors there approved putting her on the wait list for a liver transplant.

The news changed everything. Erika finally had hope. Around the house, 4-year-old Loïe would say, ""Mommy, when you get a new liver, can you push me in the swing?""

But Erika hit an immediate wall. Her insurer, UnitedHealthcare, denied coverage for the transplant, saying it would not be a ""promising treatment."" She appealed and was rejected again.

The mom who desperately wanted to live looked into Oregon's Death with Dignity program. Erika had written a letter to her daughter months ago to be read after she died. Now she worried Loïe might receive it sooner than Mom had planned:

Dear Loïe,

If you're reading this, I'm probably not on this earth anymore. So please remember this:

I am with you always; even if you can no longer see my face or feel my hands through your hair. I am with you when you look up to the sky and see tiny birds flying free or the stars twinkling in your eyes. I am with you when you feel a perfect, warm breeze upon your sweet face.

Erika wasn't going to give up. Her little girl with bright blue eyes was a constant reminder of all that is precious.

Outraged and heartbroken, Erika wrote a four-page letter to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare (UHC), giving him a piece of her mind about what she felt was a rigged review process, riddled with errors, that determined her life wasn't worth saving.

Weeks passed until the company reached a decision. Despite her plea, the answer was the same: Denied.

Then, last week, an amazing thing happened.

Erika Zak and her husband, Scott Powers, lock hands during a recent hospital visit. The two met 20 years ago.

'My life hangs in the balance'

If it's true that opening your heart, revealing your feelings, unleashes freedom and makes you whole, Erika turned to one of the things she loves most in an effort to save her life. Writing.

It was early April. She sat at her computer, her keyboard clacking. She wasn't going to leave her husband, Scott Powers, and their daughter Loïe behind without trying her damnedest to stay on this Earth for as long as possible.

There was too much at stake.

UnitedHealthcare had overruled her treating physicians and denied the transplant, saying ""unproven health services is not a covered benefit."" The words burned, like chemo. Her first appeal went nowhere, and she felt trapped in a labyrinth of red tape.

The young mother -- frail from having lost 20 pounds in the past year, her skin and eyes yellow from jaundice -- felt the only way to get a new liver was to plead her case directly to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann.

Her frame may be tiny, but don't mistake that for weakness. She is one of the strongest women you will ever meet.

As she typed, Erika bared her soul. Of longing to live. Of seeing her daughter grow up. Of the need for ""my only option,"" a liver transplant.

""Given that my life hangs in the balance based on this review,"" she wrote, ""it is unconscionable that it has not been undertaken with the level of competence and professionalism anyone would expect of UHC.""

She blasted what she called the ""shockingly incompetent manner"" in which the country's largest insurance company handled her case. She outlined what she described as a series of errors made in the review process -- ranging from UHC saying her liver failure stems from ""chemotherapy toxicity"" to an insurance medical director who erroneously said she had ""life-threatening lesions.""

""Neither are true,"" she wrote Wichmann. ""(UHC's) handling of my case has been plagued by unnecessary delays, incomplete responses, inept scheduling, contradictory statements, and worst of all repeated factual errors regarding my medical history.

""Most importantly, decisions based on inaccurate information and analysis have already delayed my listing and transplant two months.""

Loie has been with her mother throughout the process. Erika calls her ""my tiniest, most amazing companion.""

One review doctor noted she had a ""9cm tumor"" in her liver, she wrote, apparently unaware that was actually the hole from the ablation surgery resulting in her chronic liver failure.

""I have been doing every single thing I possibly can do to stay alive for these past four years, scratching and clawing by day and praying every night an opportunity like this would come along,"" Erika wrote. ""Now, when the promise of my long-term survival is actually greatest, I need UHC's support more than ever.""

She sent the letter via FedEx on April 11.

Her concerns were valid. Her transplant team at the Cleveland Clinic made clear to UHC's appeals unit the primary cause of her liver failure was not from chemo toxicity or cancer, but instead was the result of ""a consequence of complications following microwave ablation.""

""Of note, what mainly drives the indication of liver transplantation in this case is liver failure and NOT liver metastases from colorectal cancer, which makes the patient's post-transplant oncologic outcome more encouraging,"" wrote Dr. Federico Aucejo, the director of the Cleveland Clinic's Liver Cancer Program, in an appeal on Erika's behalf on March 6. He did note that she had some chemotoxicity, which was a secondary cause of liver failure.

""The opinion of the experienced Cleveland Clinic multidisciplinary liver transplant committee (is) that liver transplantation would prolong this young patient's life substantially, and that there is NO other treatment alternative that could match this outcome at this point in time.""

Two days after sending her letter, Erika and her husband were told the UHC executive team had received it and that her case was undergoing further review.

Several times, the family said it was told a decision would be made by a certain date; those dates came and went without a decision.

As time wore on, Erika grew ill with a high fever and was hospitalized for several days. It was the fifth time she'd been admitted since February 2, the day Cleveland Clinic doctors approved her for a transplant.

On Instagram, she posted an illustration with the words ""waiting, waiting, waiting"" on a pink backdrop with black crosses.

""Waiting for insurance to approve the only thing that will save me: a liver,"" she wrote. ""Waiting for my liver to fail completely; waiting to die. Waiting to be saved.""

Erika has undergone multiple surgeries and faced more than 70 rounds of chemotherapy.

'Wait or die'

More than 100,000 Americans are on wait lists for organ transplants, and every hour someone dies while waiting for the life-saving surgery, said Dr. Andrew Cameron, the chief of transplant surgery at Johns Hopkins and the surgical director of its liver transplant program.

For liver transplants, 20,000 Americans are on the wait list and only 7,000 will receive a new liver in 2018, according to Cameron, who is not connected to Erika's case.

""The lucky few undergo a transformative life-saving procedure,"" he said. ""Those who don't get that lottery ticket wait or die.""

Transplant teams at hospitals spend hours upon hours -- months even -- assessing and debating whether a patient is a good candidate for a transplant, Cameron said, typically with more than a dozen doctors weighing in.

It is deeply disturbing, he said, when an insurance company overrules the ""decision made by a thoughtful, careful transplant team to utilize one of society's limited resources -- that precious gift to save somebody's life.""

The negotiated cost for a liver transplant for an insurance company is roughly $200,000, Cameron said, adding it is ""exceedingly rare"" for an insurer to deny a transplant.

""That is highly unusual and highly undesirable,"" Cameron told CNN.

In Cleveland, Dr. Aucejo is trailblazing the field for patients like Erika, having performed the only two transplants in America this century on people suffering from what is called unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer.

It's groundbreaking and could prove transformative.

""I hope that we can achieve good results and set precedent,"" he said.

Dr. Skye Mayo, a surgical oncologist at Oregon Health & Science University, has treated Erika Zak since 2015.

When you're trying such a new approach, Dr. Aucejo said, it can be difficult getting insurers to agree to treatment and he wished getting them aboard could be done ""in a more expeditious way.""

He explained that in the late 1980s and 1990s, surgeons tried transplants on patients like Erika with ""unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer,"" but the ""outcomes were not good.""

Only 18% of the patients lived past five years, so the transplants were stopped, Dr. Aucejo said. But, he emphasized, most of the bad outcomes were the result of technical complications and post-transplant management, not from the cancer returning. The field of transplants has greatly improved in the decades since, he said.

Doctors in Europe, primarily in Norway, have begun changing the field, he said, finding that about 50-60% of patients with Erika's condition survive a transplant past five years.

That is a substantial difference, he said.

Dr. Mayo, Erika's surgical oncologist in Oregon, said no one at the insurance company reached out to him during the review process ""to help explain the facts of her case.""

That is troubling, he said, especially when it's one of the most complicated cases a doctor will ever see.

""It is frustrating when it seems that the facts aren't all being considered,"" Dr. Mayo said.

""Her life now is not limited by her cancer,"" he said. ""It's limited by the fact she will go into liver failure and die within the next several months if she doesn't have a liver transplant.""

Erika wrote a note for her daughter if she does not survive: ""I am with you always; even if you can no longer see my face or feel my hands through your hair.""

When opposites attract

Erika was in the prime of her life. At 34, she'd given birth to her first and only child, Loïe, the little girl who Mom calls ""my tiniest, most amazing companion.""

She'd been married to the love of her life for four years. She and Scott met in 1998 when he was at Brown University and she was at the Rhode Island School of Design, both in Providence.

The two were polar opposites. He was the MVP of Brown's soccer team and majored in economics. She was into the arts and majored in textile design. He was from the tightly wound East Coast, she from the free-wheeling West Coast.

The connection wasn't immediate, so Erika had a mutual friend slip a tiny drawing to Scott. It contained her phone number; he called it.

Soon they clicked. Scott made her laugh and feel beautiful. Erika saw in him someone who was kind and devoted; in her, he found the woman who he'd always searched for, with a captivating sense of humor and a sailor's mouth.

They tied the knot on Halloween in 2009 in the wine country of Healdsburg, California.

Her career was taking off, too. She was working for Old Navy, choosing and designing the fabrics, prints and plaids for the company's baby and toddler division. While she was pregnant, she was promoted to senior textile designer.

""It was all coming together,"" she wrote on her blog. ""And then, like that, my foundation crumbled.""

During the final trimester of her pregnancy, she'd experienced pain in her stomach. It was thought to be nothing more than part of the difficulties of pregnancy. But in the weeks after delivery, the pain grew excruciating and she felt a lump on her side.

On April 8, 2014, she received the awful news -- that she had stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver. Her daughter was just 3 months old.

""Worst Day Ever"" read the headline of her blog.

She had survived cancer once before. At 28, she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Her thyroid was removed, and life continued as normal. It was nothing close to a stage 4 diagnosis.

In the years after her colon cancer diagnosis, she blogged about most everything. Of losing her father to Alzheimer's at age 83. Of the pain over two friends' deaths -- including an oncologist she'd met in a cancer support group.

""Have you ever cried and screamed so hard that the blood vessels around your eyes burst?"" she wrote.

In her blog posts, she was brutally honest about her cancer and the effects of chemotherapy.

Erika and Scott Powers met in college while they were both in school in Rhode Island.

She'd sit on the shower floor in a fetal position, screaming and sobbing. It was ""anguish and pain and longing for my former life and utter disbelief for the war my body was waging on itself,"" she blogged.

Her fingertips felt like they had been ""burned on a hot pan most of the time."" Her hands cramped into weird, contorted positions. Her hair was dry and brittle, like straw. Her energy was so drained she felt twice her age.

As a teen, she'd suffered debilitating depression and anxiety that was so bad at times, she said, ""I hoped that I could just disappear forever.""

""It's funny how afraid I am of that now: disappearing. How much I want to live. How important it feels to be here,"" she wrote on December 1, 2016, two and half years into her cancer battle.

She would face multiple surgeries and undergo more than 70 rounds of chemo. On February 28, 2017, she wrote:

""This is chemo day. Scream in your pillow day. Hide in the shower day. Lie to your baby day. Tell her you're going to work day. Vials and vials of blood day. Tell your doctor you're angry day. Make your husband cry day. Poison your body day.""

On another day, she penned: ""Cancer is a slow form of torture. It strips you of dignity; of peace of mind; of stability.""

On April 4, 2017, nearly three years to the day of her diagnosis, she and her daughter had a soul-crushing conversation. The cancer had been eradicated from her colon shortly after the diagnosis, but it remained in her liver.

""Mommy, are you going to last?"" Loïe asked.

""What do you mean, Loïe?""

""Will you be here forever and ever?"" the girl asked.

""I really don't know, babe.""

As she awaited word from her insurer about the transplant, Erika said, ""I'm mad and grouchy, but I still feel like I have a fighting chance.""

Six days later, Erika underwent the ablation surgery at a facility in New York to target two small tumors on her liver. Something went wrong. She ended up with the hole in her liver.

To save her life, surgeons had to block off the veins and arteries going to her liver. The entire central part of her liver died, Dr. Mayo said. Two bags are now attached to her abdomen to drain the bile.

With bile going immediately outside her body, instead of through the liver and her body, Erika was susceptible to extreme sickness and potential fatal bleeds.

""All of those things culminated in what is now liver failure for her,"" Dr. Mayo said. ""She's in this cycle right now where she's losing on a daily basis some of her body's most vital fluids.""

The cancer in her liver, meanwhile, was progressing on a path, he said, where ""she would die of cancer."" She could no longer tolerate any standard form of chemo treatment.

Her doctors in Oregon last fall tried one last treatment to fend off her cancer: a groundbreaking immunotherapy cancer drug called pembrolizumab, known by its brand name Keytruda.

Her sky-high tumor marker levels fell to normal. ""She had an incredible response to this new drug,"" Dr. Mayo said. ""I think all of the cancer remaining in her body is dead at this point. What she will die of is liver failure.""

With a new liver, he said, her problems with bleeding and high blood pressure could be resolved. Her jaundice would be gone, too.

But transplant surgery is not without major risks.

Most of those who've received a transplant with unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer, Cleveland's Dr. Aucejo said, experience a recurrence of cancer within 12 months.

Most of the cancers that return can be treated with standard care, like chemotherapy or surgery, he said, profoundly prolonging their lives.

For a small subset of patients, though, the cancer comes back aggressively and it's not treatable with chemo or surgery, he said. ""Unfortunately in that subset of patients, the survival is more dismal.""

While it's impossible to predict the outcome, he said, Erika shows ""features that may do well."" There's no evidence cancer has spread beyond her liver, he said.

Plus, patients who had their colon cancer removed two years or more before the transplant, Dr. Aucejo said, tend do well. Erika had the cancerous portion of her colon removed in 2014: ""That's a good indicator.""

Dr. Aucejo also emphasized the criteria for transplant qualification is stringent and that Erika shows promise.

""We're talking about distributing limited organs,"" he said. ""Again, we have to be very careful that we're not giving organs to people who are not going to benefit from it when there's people dying with standard indications because there's not enough organs.""

Erika Zak comes to the hospital every three weeks for a groundbreaking immunotherapy drug. Her doctors says that without it, she would have died of cancer.

'This is so messed up'

In the days and weeks after Erika fired off her letter to the CEO, her husband, Scott, worked the phones.

He felt lost in an endless loop of delays and broken promises as to when the insurer would reach its decision.

Finally, they were told a decision would come May 2.

Erika couldn't sleep the night before. She pulled out her phone and recorded a message, weeping for much of the video.

""My life is literally in their hands, and every day I feel myself kind of fading away more and more,"" she says. ""I don't want to leave. I don't want to die.""

The next day came. Each minute crept by.

Shortly after 2 p.m., Scott's phone rang.

It was their point of contact with UnitedHealthcare.

He had crushing news: Denied.

He explained Erika's case was sent back to the three reviewing doctors. One of them, he said, ""changed his decision from 'not promising' to 'promising.'""

However, the other two doctors ruled the transplant not to be promising: ""The bottom line is they're upholding that decision.""

The doctor who sided in favor of the transplant, their UHC contact told them, was the only one of the three who talked directly with her transplant surgeon.

Scott grew furious. ""Honestly, you know that is messed up,"" he said. ""I don't know who you've got to go to, but I would go to someone now and have someone call us, because this is so messed up.""

Scott Powers has advocated for his wife since she was first diagnosed with cancer.

Scott pressed for more information. He got little.

""Scott, I know what you've been through,"" the UHC rep told him. ""I know what you're going through.""

Erika sat silently for the first 10 minutes of the conservation, absorbing the news and what it meant for her fate. But at those words, it was time to speak up.

""Hey!"" she shouted. ""This is Erika, and you've never heard from me before. You don't know what we're going through. Because I'm dying.""

Through tears, she said, ""I need a liver transplant, and I need it now.""

The UHC rep confided he ""was not hoping for this outcome. I was hoping that I'd have good news.""

He suggested Erika and Scott fax over any new information they thought might be relevant. He also acknowledged the delays in recent weeks were not in keeping with the company's policies.

""Someone needs to be accountable for this,"" he said. ""You know, why, when we have these guidelines in place, did we not follow them?

""That needs to be looked into,"" he said, adding, ""I'm not trying to sweep anything under the rug.""

He apologized for having to be the bearer of bad news, saying his goal had been to end the day on a positive note.

""Like I said, I wish I had better news.""

After more than 30 minutes, he ended with: ""Have a good night, OK.""

Not the words the couple wanted to hear.

Erika went numb. Heartbroken and angry didn't even begin to describe her feelings.

Scott felt equally distraught. ""I just want her to get a liver,"" he said. ""She deserves that.""

The CEO never responded -- not by email, phone or letter.

Erika Zak says her will to live is motivated by her daughter, Loïe. Here, they play on the couch as the family dog, Maddie, watches.

A sudden change

Five days later, on Monday, May 7, a surprise call came. Erika and Scott were preparing Loïe for school when Scott's phone rang.

They had spent the weekend trying to figure out their next move, while trying not to focus too much on when Erika might need Death with Dignity. They knew they had one appeal left, and they didn't want to blow it.

They hadn't sent any new information since the last call.

It was their UHC rep on the phone. This time, he had good news: The insurer would cover Erika's transplant.

When Scott heard she'd been approved, he jumped up and down. Erika watched him from across the room.

There was no explanation for the change. They were told to focus on Erika's health and next steps.

Erika called her mother, who unleashed a guttural scream at work.

Loïe has grown excited at the prospect of her mother's transplant. Erika just wants to be able to walk her to school or take her to the playground.

Dr. Mayo was preparing for surgery when he took Scott's call. Elation spread across the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University where doctors, nurses and staff celebrated.

In Cleveland, Dr. Aucejo heard the welcome news from his transplant coordinator. He'd not spoken with anyone at UHC about the case in the five days since the previous denial.

""They had decided on their own. We hadn't gotten back to them,"" he said. ""I'm happy they ended up sharing our vision.""

I had been speaking with Erika and Scott for this story over the last month and had reviewed her medical records extensively. During the May 2 phone call in which Erika was told her transplant had been denied, Scott told the UHC rep that the couple had been speaking with a member of the national news media.

I was on a flight to Oregon when they received the joyous news. ""UHC just called and approved Erika. Unreal. Know you're in flight but call whenever,"" Scott texted.

When we met a couple hours later, Erika's emotions were still raw. She thought this would be her last Mother's Day. Now, suddenly, she has hope for more.

Glancing at her daughter and husband, Erika broke down in tears.

""I can't imagine not being here,"" she said. ""It's not because I keep the family together or anything. It's just the love I have for them.""

""Mommy, why are you crying?"" Loïe said.

""I'm crying because I love you.""

Loïe placed her fingers in her mother's right hand.

""Love you,"" Loïe said.

As she and Loïe locked hands, the tattoo on Erika's wrist displayed a fitting message: ""Be brave.""

During her cancer fight, Erika and her twin sister got matching tatoos with one message: ""Be brave.""

Epilogue

UnitedHealthcare declined to answer CNN's questions about the handling of Erika's case, except to issue this one-sentence statement:

""We had on-going conversations with her husband and contacted him as soon as the decision was made to approve the transplant request.""

Even after the approval, Erika said she still wanted to move forward with the story, to speak up for others who've experienced the pain of similar denials. To let them know they're not alone. To encourage them to be their own best advocates.

It can mean the difference between life and death.

""No one should have to fight and work that hard,"" she said, ""especially when I have all these doctors saying it will save my life.""

Since the approval, the family has been preparing to move to Cleveland for Erika's surgery and recovery at the Cleveland Clinic. Erika was officially notified Friday morning she was placed on the liver transplant wait list.

It's impossible to know how long the family will be in Cleveland or when the transplant will occur. Transplant candidates are given what is known as a ""MELD score,"" ranging from 6 to 40. Those closest to 40 are given the highest priority.

Erika's MELD score has hovered around 22. If her score is still in that range, Dr. Aucejo said, her transplant could be a few months away.

""But this varies a lot,"" he said. ""There are many variables at play here.""

A patient for a liver transplant, he said, is typically hospitalized 7 to 10 days for the procedure, with a recovery time of 4 to 8 weeks before the patient resumes normal activities.

Would Erika have had the transplant by now if the surgery had been approved in February?

Every day Erika says she can feel her body deteriorating. ""I don't want to die,"" she says.

""That is very speculative, at the least,"" Dr. Aucejo said. ""I couldn't say that.""

He chose his words carefully, saying it's a ""complex dynamic"" between hospitals and insurance companies and he doesn't want to upset that balance.

""She's been approved and that's what matters -- and hopefully we can move forward with her transplant.""

Dr. Aucejo said he can somewhat understand the insurance company's initial reluctance at coverage because the procedure is so rare for patients with Erika's condition.

""It's a new territory,"" he told CNN. ""I can't blame anybody.""

If Erika receives her transplant and succeeds, Dr. Aucejo said, she could help set precedent for many others down the road.

More than anything, she would finally get a chance to be the mother she wants to be."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180511182630-11-liver-transplant-mom-super-tease.jpg
0b3272e137be4a9489967e85a726b10d	['Jessica Ravitz', 'Cnn Photographs Monica Almeida For Cnn']	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Why a terminally ill young woman changed her mind about living	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Why a terminally ill young woman changed her mind about living	1	"La Jolla, California (CNN) To face each day, Claire Wineland undergoes hours of breathing treatments. It's a reality of living with cystic fibrosis she's come to accept.

But last month, as the nebulizer hummed loudly in her La Jolla, California, hotel room, she breathed in medicine through her mask and hoped this day would be the first step toward something different.

She'd traveled from Los Angeles with her mother, her best friend and her pit bull, Daisy, who flopped down on the floor atop one of Claire's ever-present oxygen tubes. A full day of appointments at a nearby medical center awaited her, when she would begin the evaluation process to see whether she might be a candidate for a double-lung transplant.

A year earlier, Claire vowed that she'd never have the major surgery.

""It's not for me and never has been,"" she said at the time.

She was more comfortable dealing with the illness she knew than taking on the unknown. She preferred to focus on leading a purposeful life than worrying about death and how to dodge it.

Claire Wineland sits in her hotel room with dog Daisy before heading to evaluations at the Center for Transplantation at UC San Diego Health.

A series of irreversible setbacks and some painful soul-searching, however, have prompted an about-face in her thinking. Claire, 21, needs new lungs, or she will die -- sooner than she's willing to accept.

The only question is: Did her change of heart come too late?

Feeling trapped

It wasn't as if the clouds parted and she suddenly saw the light. Claire's new outlook was the result of a messy and humbling self-reckoning.

She had long managed to push through physical discomfort to lead a life that mattered. After emerging from a 16-day medically induced coma at age 13, she envisioned the Claire's Place Foundation , which today provides financial support to struggling families affected by cystic fibrosis. She appeared in brutally honest viral videos in which she talked about topics like death and did it with a smile. Since she was 14, she had been taking to stages and wowing audiences with beyond-her-years wisdom. Along the way, she nurtured a love of travel.

She was wrapping up a three-city tour last fall when pneumonia landed her in a Philadelphia hospital for two weeks.

Doctors there sat her down and told Claire she had to stop flying. Period. They told her that her lungs could collapse and that she ran the risk of dropping dead on a plane, she said. They warned that it would be painful and laid out what it would feel like if an air pocket in her lungs burst.

""You will feel like you're being stabbed to death ... and then blood will stop flowing to your brain,"" she remembered them saying. ""And I was like, 'OK, I got the message! Copy that!' ""

She took a three-day train ride home and began to settle down.

Because her body works so hard to breathe, Claire must take in about 5,000 calories a day and relies on a feeding tube to absorb calories while she sleeps.

Cystic fibrosis affects more than 30,000 people in the United States (and more than 70,000 worldwide), according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation . The disease causes an overabundance of mucus, which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs, complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, eventually, leads to respiratory failure.

The median survival age is about 40, according to the foundation -- a great improvement from the 1950s, when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare.

Claire became uber-diligent with her care. She was on top of her dozens of medications, including her shots for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, endured as best she could the feeding tube at night, even though it made her throw up, and spent extra time with her breathing treatments. For four hours daily, she said, she wore a vest to shake her lungs and loosen mucus. She also tried supplements like turmeric and found comfort in the nettle infusions she drank throughout the day.

But even with all of this, her lung function continued to decline. In one year, she said her working lung capacity fell 10 points -- from 35% to 25%. Short walks and visits to the beach left this lover of the outdoors exhausted. Simple grocery shopping became too tough to manage. She had no energy for local speaking engagements and lost her income flow. She felt homebound, trapped and unable to do what mattered to her most.

CFers, as she refers to people with cystic fibrosis, often talk about ""the Wheelchair Decision"" with dread, Claire said. But when breathing and getting around became too difficult and she got hers in February, it initially felt ""like freedom.""

With her best friend, Larissa, taking on the role of ""designated wheeler,"" the duo could tool around outside. The day she got the wheelchair, they went on a seven-hour adventure around Los Angeles' Venice Beach, where Claire lives, visiting the canals, going to the park, soaking in the ocean breeze.

And while most of the time, she has no qualms about needing a wheelchair, there are accessibility issues, the sidewalks are a mess, and she can't be pushed through sand. Inevitably, she's had those moments when she thinks, ""It sucks that I need this. It's painful that it's gotten this far.""

Claire breathes in medicine through a nebulizer as Larissa pounds her back with cupped hands to help loosen mucus in her airways.

Then Claire, who's undergone more than 30 surgeries and been in the hospital a quarter of her life, received another jolt during a March hospital stay. Medical staff discovered that her portacath wasn't working. The small dome under the skin of her chest provides a central line into a vein, allowing easy administration of IV treatments -- such as antibiotics, which she must take regularly to beat back constant infections. A portacath replacement means surgery, and Claire's pulmonary function was -- and remains -- at a level too dangerous for her to go under anesthesia.

Though the portacath was fixable, Claire didn't know it would be at the time. A wave of terror washed over her. She fell apart and realized it was time to take the transplant idea seriously.

""I can't go under anesthesia. I can't fly. I can't do anything,"" she remembered feeling with a panic. ""I have completely locked myself in a position of not being able to do anything besides die.""

Ready for the race

After leaving the La Jolla hotel, Claire was wheeled into the Center for Transplantation at UC San Diego Health, prepared to meet with members of the lung transplant team.

She'd eaten a McDonald's McGriddle sandwich the day before -- a secret she employs to put on an extra pound or two before weigh-ins -- just in case they asked her and her 95-pound frame to step on a scale. She was armed with questions and a notepad, ready to studiously record all she'd learn. Since she'd been here less than two years earlier and decided against pursuing the transplant path then, she was eager to tell them why this time was different.

A nurse who serves as the lung transplant coordinator, Megan Serletti, spent several hours educating Claire, her mom and Larissa about the process.

Megan Serletti, top, a nurse who works as a lung transplant coordinator, leads Claire and her mom, Melissa Nordquist Yeager, into the transplantation center.

They talked about the battery of tests that would determine whether she would qualify to get on the waiting list, some of which Claire knew well and described as ""gnarly."" They discussed the lung allocation score, the number Claire will get if she's approved that measures how sick she is and determines where she sits on the priority list.

They discussed what life on a waitlist looks like: the necessity that she stay within a four-hour drive of the center, the importance of not ignoring phone calls, the exercise she'd need to grow stronger and the multitude of blood draws and exams she'd have on her schedule.

""We call a transplant your marathon,"" Serletti said. ""We tell people to train for your marathon. The day you get called is the day of the race.""

There were forms to sign and questions she'd need to consider. For example, would she be willing to accept lungs from a prostitute?

""I'm fine if a donor had sex in exchange for money,"" Claire quipped. ""Way to bring the hustle.""

How about from someone who was an IV drug user and contracted hepatitis C, a condition that is treatable?

""Honestly, I'd just laugh if I got new lungs and caught something else,"" she said. ""I already have the body of someone who's been around the block.""

Serletti spoke of the realities after surgery, including the drugs Claire would need to take for the rest of her life, the physical and emotional challenges she might face, the changes in lifestyle she'd have to honor.

Claire wrote everything down. She curled her legs into the chair, revealing the tattoo on her left ankle: the thumbs-up ""Don't Panic"" logo from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""

""None of it spooked me,"" Claire said afterward, over lunch in the transplantation center's courtyard. ""Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do, I don't care about any of the side effects. I'm willing to deal with anything.""

'We both just started crying'

To qualify for new lungs, a person must be sick enough to need a transplant yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery.

There were 1,436 candidates for lung transplants as of April 20, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing , which manages the nation's organ waiting lists. Of those, 122 had a primary diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Last year, of the total 2,449 lung transplants performed, CFers accounted for nearly 11% of the recipients.

Unlike previous introductory meetings, when her heart wasn't in it, Claire takes in every word during this education session about lung transplants.

A lung transplant is not a cure, but it can extend a life, if all goes well.

Of those who received lung transplants (not just CFers), dating to 2000, an average of 84% survived after one year, nearly 54% survived five years, and slightly more than 30% survived 10 years or more, according to the organ sharing network's data.

Deciding to go for a lung transplant, let alone a double-lung transplant (the only option for CFers), is no small matter.

Claire first visited a transplantation center at UCLA when she was 14 but said that was too early for the idea to make sense for her. At 17, she checked out the program at Stanford University but was turned down, her mom explained, because they could tell that Claire wasn't interested. She checked out the option again, at the very place she had returned to now, when she was 19.

While her peers were being tasked with picking out prom dresses or decorating dorm rooms, she was being asked to contemplate her mortality.

She prayed that she'd want it as much as she knew her parents and doctors did, but her heart wasn't in it, she said. She was still happy with what she had and, as an adult, able to make her own decisions.

Her parents, who split up when Claire was 3, struggled to make peace with her choice.

""Just think of it as insurance, even if you don't want to do it,"" her mother, Melissa Nordquist Yeager, pleaded at first. ""Get on the list so you can change your mind.""

But ever since she'd been a small child, Claire had a sense of self, an understanding of her condition and a sort of intuition Yeager needed to trust -- even if it made her uncomfortable.

Her dad, John Wineland, said Claire ""has a relationship with her body that is sacred"" and described his daughter's thinking: ""This is the body I came in with. This is the body I'm going out with.""

And as her parent, he said, ""I have to live with it.""

To see her struggle and deteriorate over the past year was both sobering and excruciating for them. So when Claire broke down and said she'd changed her mind, they were thrilled, excited and terrified.

""I was blown away, so grateful, happy and hopeful. It was a sign that she wasn't willing to give up,"" remembered Yeager, who was with Claire at the hospital in March and heard the news first.

""I called her dad, and we both just started crying,"" Yeager said.

""I'm just praying my ass off, really, that everything goes smoothly, that she can get a shot at more time on the planet,"" Claire's dad said. ""There are a lot of hoops she has to jump through to be accepted.""

'Are you ready?'

It's not uncommon for CFers to change their minds about transplant, social worker Leslie Fijolek assured Claire.

Fijolek, who serves on the transplant team, remembered Claire from the last time she visited UC San Diego Health. Fijolek's job is to think about ""who are these [new] lungs going to live with,"" she said, get a sense of the care system recipients have in place and provide support to make the process successful for everyone involved.

Is Claire compliant in taking her medications? Is she prepared to relocate near the transplantation center, where she'll need to be for at least three months after the transplant if she gets one? Who'd move with her and drive her to appointments?

""How's your mood been? Any depression and anxiety?"" Fijolek asked.

Leslie Fijolek, a social worker, asks Claire hard questions to see whether she's prepared to take on what a transplant would mean.

Claire mentioned how her decline, starting last fall, threw her into a depression. They talked about how she'd lost the ability to manage her physical decline, how she'd like to find a therapist who works with patients facing chronic illness, how she turns to arts and crafts projects to get out of bed -- and out of her head -- on rough days.

Photos on a cell phone are passed around, showing the papier-mache tree she's been working on and how the bark and surrounding foliage are remarkably true to life.

Fijolek turned serious, locked eyes with Claire and said what everyone in the room already understood: ""You know you need a transplant.""

""I was so young. I was so naïve,"" Claire answered, describing where she was before. ""All the side effects used to scare the shit out of me. My relationship to transplant and all it entails has changed.""

Fijolek, who was all too familiar with Claire's past ambivalence, pushed her further.

""Let's say you got listed in about two weeks; it means you can get a call at any time,"" she said. ""Are you ready?""

Claire assured her she is.

""It's a big change from where you were,"" the social worker said.

""I didn't want to waste anyone's time,"" Claire answered.

Her mother sat by, fanning herself with a medical brochure, listened and wiped a tear from her eye.

All she had

The last appointment of the day was with one of the transplant team's pulmonologists.

Dr. Kamyar Afshar explains the importance of Claire building her strength so she can handle the transplant, if she's given one.

Dr. Kamyar Afshar got down to the nitty gritty. He wanted to know what antibiotics still worked for her, how many bowel movements she has a day and the last time she coughed up blood.

""Two days ago,"" she told him. ""It's usually one or two times a month.""

He prescribed walks every day to build up her endurance and suggested she increase her continuous oxygen flow from her normal 2 liters per minute to 6 liters per minute when exercising. He looked down at her worn Birkenstocks and said, ""Your shoes will have to change.""

The doctor cranked up her oxygen and told her that if she wanted to get a transplant, she'd need to be able to do 15 sits-to-stands in a minute. He said this was non-negotiable. She won't be able to use her arms after the surgery to get up from a chair or bed, he explained.

He asked her to climb off the exam table and show him some squats.

Claire -- who used to do yoga six days a week, loved to swim and even went through a phase when she did difficult workout videos like P90X with her dad -- crossed her arms in front of her chest and showed the doctor all she had.

For the first time that day, her cheeks had color.

""I don't anticipate you'd be on the list for too long,"" Afshar blurted out.

Given her blood type and her condition, he said, she'd probably get a transplant within three months of being approved -- if she's approved.

The first full day of evaluation appoitnments complete, Claire and her mom breathe sighs of overwhelmed relief.

Claire's eyes opened wide, and her mom appeared to melt into her chair. Suddenly, it seemed real.

""Three months!"" Yeager said outside the center. ""That made me want to throw up a little bit.""

""I'm a little overwhelmed,"" Claire said. ""I need to go back to the hotel and binge-watch 'Real Housewives.' I want to see white women fight over nothingness.""

Hoping for a chance

The truth is, according to Claire, not longing for different lungs for most of her life served her well.

She was able to ""work with what I had in front of me,"" she said, rather than fixate on what she didn't have. She also suppressed that part of herself that might have simply dreamed of something more.

""If I had told myself things could be better than they are now, I think I would have driven myself crazy with frustration and jealousy over other people's lives,"" she said.

In changing her mind, she said she had to swallow some of her pride and ""open this floodgate of emotion that I kept really deeply buried.""

A slew of tests still awaited Claire, but she was now all in. She had opened herself up to the possibility that life -- for her -- could be different and not as challenging.

""For the first time ever, I'm going there, and it's really scary,"" she said. ""Now that I actually want something better, what if it doesn't happen? What if I don't get it? What if it goes wrong?""

The pressure is on, and Claire can only hope that she will be given her chance."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180522152317-01-claire-wineland-restricted-super-tease.jpg
c0634f471a634f49a82e16a56ae6801b	['Nick Busca']	2018-04-13 00:00:00	The new frontier of gene doping will modify athlete DNA	https://www.cnn.com/	US	The new frontier of gene doping will modify athlete DNA	1	"For a busy physiologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, that may be expected, but the reason behind the calls wasn't exactly run-of-the-mill.

The people on the other end of the line were athletes in search of a particular kind of fix: They wanted him to dope them -- via their genes.

In the late 1990s, Sweeney made headlines because of his research on ""Schwarzenegger mice,"" which were up to 30% stronger than their average counterparts. Sweeney had been able to isolate the gene responsible for activating a protein -- IGF-1 -- that controls muscle growth and repair.

The main focus of his experiments was on how to limit the deterioration of muscles with age, but the results also appealed to athletes in search of a performance boost.

Word got out, however, that he was not interested.

Ahead of this year's Commonwealth Games, which started April 4, Sweeney's was not such a hot number for athletes in search of an unfair advantage -- possibly because he is now an adviser for the World Anti-Doping Agency.

""At the beginning, when we first started publishing on this, we did get contacted by high-level athletes,"" said Sweeney, who's also director of the University of Florida's Myology Institute. ""These days, it's mostly body builders and people desperate to increase their performance or abilities.""

Back then, gene therapy -- defined as the technique of using and manipulating genes in order to treat or prevent diseases -- wasn't as established as it is today and wasn't recognised as enough of a threat to be listed as a banned practice in sport. But it soon became known that gene therapies could one day be used for much more than disease.

Responding promptly to the possibility, in 2002, the anti-doping agency established ""gene and cell-doping panels"" of expert scientists to discuss how best to head off the problem.

In 2003, the organization banned ""gene doping,"" which it defined as the ""nontherapeutic use of cells, genes, genetic elements, or modulation of gene expression, having the capacity to enhance performance.""

This new frontier of doping presented a simple and dark idea: What if there was a way for dopers to never be caught?

Now, almost 20 years later, the technology is has finally been used to treat patients with rare diseases -- such as severe combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disorder, hemophilia, blindness, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases -- by transferring missing genes into skeletal muscles, Sweeney said. ""So because of that, it is now at a point where potentially it could be used by athletes.

""It could be done today in athletes if some company and government would put the resources (in) to make it happen,"" he said.

Getting inside your genes

In the case of the ""Schwarzenegger mice,"" Sweeney used the classic method of gene therapy, in which he modified the animals' DNA using a virus to deliver and insert the required gene that would make the mice stronger.

Genes are delivered into an organism using a ""vector,"" the most common being viruses, like that used by Sweeney, which have been modified to be safe and no longer cause disease. The vectors carry the desired gene into targeted cells and, there, unload the genetic material, which in turn instructs the organism to produce the protein the gene encodes.

One example of a protein well-known to athletes is erythropoietin, commonly known as EPO, which regulates the production of red blood cells in the body, increasing hemoglobin and oxygen delivery to tissues.

With the injection of external EPO, elite athletes -- often cyclists -- have been enhancing performance for years, but authorities have caught on. Anti-doping controls can now detect external EPO efficiently through blood and urine tests.

A doping urine test kit is seen on February 25, 2015 in Chatenay, France.

If extra EPO is being produced organically by a cell's machinery, however, it is almost impossible to detect as a banned substance.

But the technology is not quite at that level yet.

""Making the viruses that are involved in doing the gene transfer is still difficult,"" Sweeney said, highlighting that the science is still complicated and not something athletes could readily do at home.

Another way to dope an athlete's genes is through CRISPR, or CRISPR-Cas9, a technique that allows geneticists to edit specific parts of a person's genome by removing or altering sections of DNA -- also known as gene editing.

The technique is rapidly developing, leading to a World Anti-Doping Agency announcement in October that it was expanding its ""gene-doping"" ban to ""gene editing agents designed to alter genome sequences and/or the transcriptional or epigenetic regulation of gene expression.""

The ban went into effect in January.

""There's a couple of ways you can use CRISPR-Cas9,"" Sweeney said. ""One is to take cells from a person, modify those cells and put them back into the person, and that is probably the safest way to use it.

""The other way to use it, which is to modify your existent DNA in the body, is potentially very unsafe.""

False kit of genetics editing with Crispr Cas-9 technology.

Sweeney pointed out that scientists do not know what unintended consequences could come from changing a specific gene in an individual, meaning the technology is not even ready for trials in patients with lethal diseases.

In the case of gene-doping through gene therapies, using vectors for delivery, it's relatively easy to look for an extra copy of a gene and confirm that an athlete has been doped when you have access to a biological sample, such as blood, said Olivier Rabin, senior executive director of sciences and international partnerships at the anti-doping agency.

In particular, Rabin said, the agency looks at white-blood cells and has developed a methodology that can be applied to search for different genes. Further detail was not provided, as it is kept confidential in order to catch athletes, he added.

""Gene editing is a little more complex than gene therapy,"" Rabin added. The anti-doping agency is working on strategies to reveal the possibility of people editing their genes for performance enhancement, he said.

Rabin highlighted that most of the agency's efforts focus on white blood cells as ""pretty good markers of gene manipulation"" because some evidence of manipulation will usually end up in the blood.

Asked what it is doing to monitor and test athletes for gene doping, the International Olympic Committee did not comment directly but said, ""We have nothing to add to the section on gene doping in WADA's prohibited list.""

The question now is whether the first few cases have, in fact, happened without our knowledge.

Modern occurrence

""I never heard anything about it except for one time, and it was around five years ago,"" said Sebastian Weber, coach of four-time Union Cycliste Internationale world champion (time trialling) Tony Martin. ""There was some buzz around a substance called AICAR,"" or 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide.

AICAR is a performance-enhancing drug that the French Anti-Doping Agency suspected was used in the 2009 Tour de France; it stimulates mitochondria, the part in the muscles responsible for aerobic energy production.

In cycling, for gene doping to be effective, techniques should target both EPO levels and red blood cell production to have a higher oxygen delivery to the muscles, Weber says -- but they would also need to increase the mass and number of mitochondria in order to actually produce energy from that oxygen.

""Just because you have more oxygen, it doesn't necessary mean you also have the capacity to produce energy out of it,"" Weber said.

As AICAR was a drug, it wasn't gene doping, but it led people to wonder about what was next, he says, after this ""first step"" toward stimulating the body's mitochondria. ""That was the only time I heard people talking about the possibility of gene-doping.""

Tailoring to your genes

There are other ways genetics -- and a deep knowledge of them -- could help athletes improve their performance, by understanding their physiology.

For example, project GENESIS -- focused on how applied genomics in elite sports can improve performance -- and its offshoot, the RugbyGene Project, are trying to identify which genetic characteristics help athletes succeed.

""We recognize it is not only genetic,"" said Dr. Alun Williams, an exercise geneticist at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK who works on both projects. ""Training, diet and other lifestyle habits are massive factors. But along with that, the evidence is that it's impossible to have success in sports without some genetic [factors] in your favor.""

The researchers of these projects are hoping to identify which genes help -- or hinder -- athletes in their specific disciplines, to develop their skills in a more tailored way. For example, if an athlete has shown to have a higher genetic vulnerability to tendon injuries, scientists and coaches could reduce certain aspects of their training load over the course of the season, give longer rest periods, reduce the number of matches played in a season, or provide specific exercises and pre-habilitation workouts.

But Williams points out that the field is still at an early stage. ""This picture where certain genes (or even two or three genes) are related to a particular characteristic, like the tendon injury, is still a small bit of a bigger picture,"" he said. ""So it's very important that this information that is available is put into context.""

A different point of view

Some experts argue that we're looking at it all wrong and that athletes will always use the most modern technology to seek out an advantage -- illegal or not.

""Modern sports have been principally valued on the basis of record-breaking and being able to witness extraordinary performances,"" said bioethicist Andy Miah, the University of Salford Chair in Science Communication and Future Media and author of ""Genetically Modified Athletes: Biomedical Ethics, Gene Doping and Sport."" ""Even if it's not a world record, it's about trying to see something special in what humans can do, and often, that is about transcending boundaries.""

We give athletes all sort of technology to do that, added Miah, who readily claims to ""disagree with anti-doping.""

Instead of the current scenario, in which anti-doping keeps trying to catch up with doping, Miah suggests a safer form of performance enhancement.

""If we can have a system where enhancement was actually medically supervised, then I think that is a much more safe and healthy."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171211211651-epigenetics-super-tease.jpg
e9a122fc79164217a10ed49d8e45fdda	"['Blake Ellis', 'Melanie Hicken', 'Cnn Investigates', 'Fda Advisory Committee Member', 'Diana Zuckerman', 'President Of The National Center For Health Research', 'Dr. Paul Andreason', 'Who Led The Fda Medical Review Of Nuplazid', ""Son Of Parkinson'S Patient""]"	2018-04-09 00:00:00	Reports of death spark concern about Parkinson's drug	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Reports of death spark concern about Parkinson's drug	1	"(CNN) Two years ago, Brendan Tyne pleaded with the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug that he was hopeful could finally bring his mother some peace.

She could no longer move without assistance and had fallen victim to the debilitating and frightening psychosis that haunts many people with Parkinson's disease.

""She thinks there are people in the house and animals are trying to get her,"" he told an FDA advisory committee.

He believed that a new medication called Nuplazid, made by San Diego-based Acadia Pharmaceuticals, was the answer.

Nuplazid's review was being expedited because it had been designated a ""breakthrough therapy"" -- meaning that it demonstrated ""substantial improvement"" in patients with serious or life-threatening diseases compared to treatments already on the market. Congress created this designation in 2012 in an effort to speed up the FDA's approval process, which has long been criticized for being too slow. Around 200 drugs have been granted this designation since its creation.

Still, to recommend approval, the advisory committee would have to find that the drug's potential benefits outweighed its risks for its intended patients.

Some FDA officials concluded that Nuplazid's public health benefit was enough to merit approval of the drug. Their argument echoed the pleas of family members and caregivers like Tyne: It could possibly help patients with no other alternative. Several of the people who spoke said their loved ones had been transformed during the clinical trials, though some said there was no way for them to know whether they were on Nuplazid or a placebo.

But the physician who led the FDA's medical review, Dr. Paul Andreason, warned that patients taking the drug during the company's clinical trials experienced serious outcomes, including death, at more than double the rate of those taking the placebo. The company's limited testing, he said, had not convinced him that the benefits outweighed the risks.

I remember leaving really, really frustrated FDA advisory committee member

While Tyne had heard about these risks, he said he ""discounted death as a real statistical possibility"" and was willing to try anything to help his mother.

""I have two young children who love their grandmother,"" he told the committee. ""If nothing is done to bring her back to some semblance of normalcy, my children will never remember their grandmother for who she is: a loving, funny, caring woman who has improved the lives of all of the loved ones who surround her. Please, I beg you, do not deprive my children and their grandmother of experiencing that love.""

'You have to take it seriously'

The committee voted 12-2 and recommended that the FDA approve Nuplazid for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis based on a six-week study of about 200 patients . Three previous studies of the drug did not show that it was effective, Andreason said in his medical review, though they showed similar risk.

Even some committee members who voted in favor of the drug expressed reservations, according to the hearing transcript. ""I guess I'm hoping that the risks are going to be small, and I think the benefits for some of these people who are very sick and whose families are affected by this, I think they're probably willing to take that risk,"" one physician stated. Another committee member said she wouldn't have voted for the drug's approval if there had been a safe and effective alternative on the market. A third made a ""plea"" to the FDA to ""consider a large observational study so we can ensure that, once it goes into real-world use, that the benefits will outweigh the risks.""

It hit the market in June 2016. As caregivers and family members rushed to get their loved ones on it, sales climbed to roughly $125 million in 2017.

Tyne got his mother on the drug as soon as it became available. But after trying it for months, he says he was devastated to see that it was doing nothing to halt the awful progression of the disease, and her hallucinations became more frequent and harder to manage. ""She has gone straight downhill to the point she really can't function at all,"" he said.

Shortly after the drug's release, patients' family members, doctors and other health care professionals started reporting ""adverse events"" possibly linked to the medication -- including deaths, life-threatening incidents, falls, insomnia, nausea and fatigue. In more than 1,000 reports, patients continued to experience hallucinations while on Nuplazid.

Creatures like cats and snakes can haunt patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis, as shown in Acadia's TV commercial.

In November, an analysis released by a nonprofit health care organization, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, warned that 244 deaths had been reported to the FDA between the drug's launch and March 2017. The organization also noted that hundreds of reports suggested the drug was ""not providing the expected benefit"" or potentially worsening the condition.

Tracked by the FDA, these so-called ""adverse event reports"" document deaths, side effects and other issues, and can be made directly by consumers, caregivers and other medical professionals. Reports are submitted to either the FDA or to the drugmaker, which is required to pass along any it receives to the federal government. In some cases, the person filing the report is convinced the side effects were caused by the drug; in others, the reporter ascribes no cause but notes that the patient was on the drug.

An adverse event report does not mean that a suspected medication has been ruled the cause of harm and is typically not the result of an official investigation. But the FDA uses the information to monitor potential issues with a drug and can take action as needed -- updating a medication's label, for instance, or restricting its use or pulling it off the market.

After analyzing the adverse event data for Nuplazid, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concluded that this batch of reports ""reinforces the concerns of those who warned that (Nuplazid) might do more harm than good."" Thomas Moore, senior scientist for drug safety and policy for the nonprofit, said the deaths are an ""important warning signal"" and warrant further review by the FDA -- and possible action, depending on what the review finds.

Since the institute released its analysis, FDA data shows that the number of reported deaths has risen to more than 700. As of last June, Nuplazid was the only medication listed as ""suspect"" in at least 500 of the death reports.

This is almost unheard of to have this many deaths reported...you have to take it seriously. Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research

Physicians, medical researchers and other experts told CNN that they worried that the drug had been approved too quickly, based on too little evidence that it was safe or effective. And given these mounting reports of deaths, they say that more needs to be done to assess Nuplazid's true risks.

""This is almost unheard of, to have this many deaths reported,"" said Diana Zuckerman, founder and president of the nonprofit thinktank the National Center for Health Research, adding that because reports are voluntary, potential problems may be underreported. ""You just don't see this with most new drugs -- you don't see all these reports -- so you have to take it seriously.""

Acadia and the FDA maintain that the medication's potential benefits continue to outweigh the risks and help fill a desperate need. Psychosis affects up to 50% of the roughly one million Americans suffering from Parkinson's disease, according to the FDA, and Nuplazid is the first drug to be approved to treat this specific condition.

Acadia said there are a number of reasons for the higher volume of death reports. Parkinson's disease psychosis is more commonly seen in patients in the most advanced stages of the disease, meaning they are already at a high risk of death. Plus, the company distributes Nuplazid through a network of specialty pharmacies that allow them to be in more frequent contact with both patients and caregivers -- meaning it is more likely to receive reports of death, which it is required to pass along to the FDA.

""If you are actively and regularly engaging patients and/or caregivers, it is inevitable that you will see a higher number of adverse events reported, especially in an older, chronically ill patient population,"" the company said in a statement.

It said its ""benefit/risk assessment of Nuplazid remains unchanged,"" and it carefully monitors and regularly analyzes safety reports from both ongoing studies and adverse event reports. The company noted, for example, that since the drug's approval, two studies of a total of more than 300 patients with Alzheimer's disease did not find a difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and the placebo.

The company also provided CNN with a statement from Dr. Joseph Jankovic, professor of neurology and an expert on movement disorders at Baylor College of Medicine. ""I have accumulated a great deal of experience with this drug,"" Jankovic said in the statement. ""While not all patients are completely satisfied, many of my patients have experienced marked improvement in their visual hallucinations, paranoia and other psychotic symptoms.""

In an interview this week, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb was asked by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta about his thoughts on drugs that receive expedited reviews and then prompt concerns about safety once they become available, like Nuplazid. While Gottlieb didn't want to comment on a specific product, he said he is ""familiar with the circumstances"" and that it's very important for the agency to make sure it is ""appropriately balancing"" safety with medical need. He said this is a flexible standard, however, and there may be more tolerance for risk in situations where there is a significant need and patients don't have an alternative.

""You've seen us take regulatory action recently in the post-market setting to limit the use of drugs when new safety concerns became known,"" he said.

The FDA told CNN it will continue to monitor the adverse event reports and review the drug's safety. It added that Nuplazid's ""complex safety profile,"" recognized at the time of its approval, resulted in a requirement that the medication carry a number of warnings on its label so that doctors could analyze potential risks and benefits before prescribing the drug.

The cases reported so far, according to the FDA, typically involved elderly patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease who suffer from numerous medical conditions and often take other medications that can increase the risk of death.

What should we investigate next? Email Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken

""Based on these data, the FDA has, at this time, not identified a specific safety issue that is not already adequately described in the product labeling,"" the agency said in a statement.

The FDA has required antipsychotics to carry its most severe ""black box"" warning for the treatment of elderly dementia patients, after studies found that the medications increase the risk of death in this population. Between 50% and 80% of Parkinson's patients experience dementia as the disease worsens, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Because Nuplazid is a new kind of antipsychotic that targets a different receptor in the brain, its maker claims it comes with fewer toxic side effects. Even so, Nuplazid also carries a black box warning.

Geriatric psychiatrist and former FDA medical officer Susan Molchan said that the number of deaths is alarming and questioned whether patients and their families are aware of the risks associated with the drug.

To determine the true risks of Nuplazid, the researchers interviewed by CNN said, the FDA needs to require further scientific studies -- and not just rely on the reports, which are challenging to interpret and are not systematically collected. They also worried that, because the drug was already approved, these studies and any action by the FDA could take years.

Hundreds of adverse event reports

A CNN review of several hundred adverse event reports shows that the detail provided for each case varies widely and that thorough investigations are rarely conducted -- making it difficult to determine whether Nuplazid might have been involved in the deaths of already sick and elderly patients.

In these reports, the physicians who prescribed the drug sometimes suggest that their patients likely died from complications from Parkinson's rather than because of Nuplazid. In other cases, it's unclear when exactly the patient started or stopped taking the medication. And in yet others, family members and sometimes doctors are convinced the drug contributed to the deaths.

This is exactly what I thought I was going to happen. Dr. Paul Andreason, who led the FDA medical review of Nuplazid

One report recounts the death of a 73-year-old woman in a long-term care facility who was taking Nuplazid. Just before 8 in the morning, a nurse noted that the woman was ""sleepy."" Shortly after, she was found unresponsive and without a pulse. Paramedics were not able to revive her and, less than an hour after the nurse's visit, she was pronounced dead. While her physician didn't believe her death was ""related"" to Nuplazid, her husband was convinced that it had played a role and paid for an autopsy. It showed only that she had pre-existing heart issues and died of cardiac arrest.

In another report, an 89-year-old man was taken off the drug after experiencing a significant decline. His doctor blamed Nuplazid for his deteriorating condition. The patient died weeks later. In a third report, a woman flagged her husband's death to the FDA after he was taken to the hospital due to dehydration. After he passed away, she said, she was told by ""someone at the hospital"" that the death was connected to his use of Nuplazid.

Acadia said it analyzed these reports and concluded that there ""is nothing to suggest a causal relationship to Nuplazid."" Acadia calculated a mortality rate for Nuplazid, which it said was lower than what you'd see in the general population of Parkinson's disease psychosis patients covered by Medicare. It calculated this using deaths reported to the FDA and what it considered a conservative estimate of patients on the drug, along with Medicare claims data. However, multiple experts interviewed by CNN said that this is an unreliable calculation since it is comparing apples to oranges.

Widening the patient pool

In the weeks after the Institute for Safe Medication Practices issued its report on the deaths, Acadia's stock price dropped by more than 20%. While many large investors remain bullish about the stock, some investment analysts have made public records requests to the FDA for the death reports.

Currently, Nuplazid can cost nearly $100 a day, according to wholesale pricing data from First Databank . That can add up to more than $30,000 a year for a single patient, though the amount a patient actually pays depends on factors including individual insurance coverage.

Acadia expects sales of Nuplazid to at least double this year.

Acadia's TV commercial shows how frightening Parkinson's disease psychosis can be.

The company, meanwhile, is forging ahead with clinical trials in an attempt to get the medication approved for use in a larger patient population: patients who have dementia-related psychosis. In October, the FDA granted its coveted breakthrough designation for this potential use as well, meaning it will also undergo a speedier review process.

While a doctor can legally prescribe a drug for any reason, insurance companies may not approve it for uses that are not FDA-approved. So FDA approval to treat dementia patients would likely result in Nuplazid being prescribed to a much wider population, concerned medical experts told CNN.

""You would certainly hope they don't approve it for anything else,"" said Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research, based on the current research and FDA adverse event reports. ""If they're going to approve it for another group of patients that is much, much larger -- that would be unconscionable.

""That is something they should absolutely not do given these unanswered questions about risk.""

'I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up'

Roughly two years have passed since that FDA meeting, where family members and caregivers -- some of whom traveled there on Acadia's dime -- gathered with medical experts to debate the merits and potential risks of Nuplazid.

Andreason, the physician who led the FDA's medical review of Nuplazid, no longer works for the agency.

He said that while he stands by the warnings he made at the time, he understands that other antipsychotics used to treat Parkinson's patients also come with an increased risk of death and that, when patients have a debilitating disease like Parkinson's, physicians and caregivers may choose a medication that improves quality of life even if it could also shorten life expectancy.

He said that he was not surprised to hear about the reports of death.

Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Son of Parkinson's patient

""This is exactly what I thought was going to happen,"" he said. ""We were going to get a burst of reports of serious adverse events and deaths.""

Dr. Stephanie Fox-Rawlings, a senior fellow at the National Center for Health Research who spoke against the drug's approval at the FDA committee meeting, recently told CNN she understands how desperate families in these situations are, but she does not think Nuplazid is the answer based on her review of Acadia's public research. She and Zuckerman said that, after previous studies didn't show it was effective, the drugmaker changed the way the medication's ability to improve psychosis was measured, which resulted in a positive outcome. Acadia said its studies have had different objectives and all of them have used ""consistent, appropriate, and validated assessment methodology.""

""If patients know there is some level of benefit, they can judge their risk,"" said Fox-Rawlings. ""But if we don't even know that it does work, how do you even judge that? It's kind of a false hope.""

Kim Witczak was the consumer representative on the FDA committee evaluating Nuplazid. She and the patient representative were the only two members to vote against its approval. She still can't believe it's on the market.

""I remember leaving really, really frustrated,"" she said.

CNN reached two of the three family members who petitioned for Nuplazid's approval at the meeting, despite having had no experience with the drug or its clinical trials, to ask whether they tried the medication once it hit the market.

One of these was Elaine Casavant. Despite the ""staggering cost"" of the medication, she said, she was quick to get her husband on it. But after three months, he showed no improvement and they stopped the medication. She has heard success stories, however, and remains optimistic that the drug could be helping certain people.

The other person was Tyne.

The 43-year-old New Jersey resident works in New York and visits his mother every weekend at a nursing home in the Bronx. Tyne has attempted to move on from the disappointment of Nuplazid, but he still gets frustrated talking about it.

""Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up,"" he said.

But he doesn't regret trying.

""If there was something that could possibly help my mom and I didn't do it, I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror.""

f1e8adc6e14c4dd88d1dc5f4fba7d63e	['Nadia Kounang']	2018-03-30 00:00:00	The Kentucky county where water smells like diesel	https://www.cnn.com/	US	The Kentucky county where water smells like diesel	1	"(CNN) For the past 20 years, Hope Workman has hustled up a dirt path on the side of a mountain in Lovely, Kentucky, just to get drinking water. She doesn't trust what comes out of her tap.

If she's by herself, she'll take her ATV. If one of her daughters is coming along, they take their four-wheel-drive truck. It takes her about seven minutes to grind up the hill before she reaches her destination: a small plastic well tapped into the side of the mountain with a 3½-foot PVC pipe.

The day CNN visited, the temperature was just above freezing, and Hope's hands shivered as she filled jug after jug with crystal-clear drinking water.

""This is what we go through to get water, unfortunately,"" she said.

Workman is not the only person in Martin County, Kentucky, or America for that matter, who struggles to get clean water. Two well-publicized crises include Flint, Michigan's, lead contamination and Puerto Rico's failing water systems in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

As our water infrastructure system ages, experts say, keeping America's water clean becomes increasingly challenging. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the nation's drinking water infrastructure a grade of D.

According to the the society, about 1 million miles of pipes crisscross the country to deliver us clean water, much of it overseen by local municipalities that are challenged with aging hardware. Many of these pipes were laid underground nearly a century ago and are reaching the end of their life spans. As they age, they can crack, and water breaks become more common. In fact, the entire country loses nearly 6 billion gallons of water a day just to leaky pipes.

For many cash-strapped local utilities, it's difficult to find the resources to manage a problem we rarely see.

Faucets run brown

But when the problem does come to the surface, it's hard to ignore. Just ask the residents of Martin County. Customers of the county's water district post videos and pictures on social media of brown cloudy water spouting out of their taps. Sometimes, it comes out looking like blue Gatorade. Sometimes, it smells like diesel fuel.

Locals ask themselves, ""Just what's in the water?""

Until several months ago, customers received notices on the back of their water bills stating that their water had been tested and found to be above federal limits of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids . These contaminants are a reaction between the chlorine used to treat the water for bacteria and organic matter that may be found in the water or the pipes. Exposure to these chemicals could mean an increased risk of cancer.

Eastern Kentucky has some of the highest levels of cancer in the country due to smoking and obesity, but residents here also wonder whether their water is to blame.

'We're just scared of the water'

Martin County resident BarbiAnn Maynard is convinced that her mother's cancer was related to the water.

""We don't really know what to do. We're just scared of the water and have been for years,"" she said.

""You're afraid to wash your hands if you've got a cut,"" Maynard said. Taking a shower is no better. ""I don't feel like I'm getting clean. I might smell a little bit better, but I don't feel any better about it.""

Dr. Don Lafferty, a local physician, feels that he's in a difficult position when patients ask him whether the water is the source of their health issues. ""I can't tell them it's safe or it isn't safe,"" he told CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

""We shouldn't have to be asking ... in 2018 whether or not water is causing cancer in our region.""

Where the War on Poverty began

Nestled in the hills of Eastern Kentucky, Martin County has had a long history tied to coal. Between 1918 and 2015, the county produced more than 436 million tons of coal. But as the coal industry died out, Martin County struggled. Nearly 40% of its population lives at or below the federal poverty level. The unemployment rate in the county is almost double the national rate.

But poverty has been endemic to the area for years. President Lyndon Johnson came here in 1964 to launch his War on Poverty.

""In 2018, in the very place where LBJ declared war on poverty ... water is our number one issue. That's hard to imagine,"" said Gary Ball, editor-in-chief of the local weekly newspaper, The Mountain Citizen.

What's happened in Martin County is a worst-case scenario that may be happening in other parts of the country, said Lindell Ormsbee, director of the Kentucky Water Resources Research Institute at the University of Kentucky.

""I think it's somewhat of a systematic representation of what's happening in a lot of other places where no one's looking. It's almost like the proverbial canary in the mine,"" Ormsbee said.

What is happening?

A large part of the issue in Martin County is just hardware itself. There are about 300 miles of piping that deliver water across the county, placed up and over rocky terrain, making them even more susceptible to leaking. Today, more than half of the water that leaves the Martin County Water District treatment center doesn't make it to the faucet.

When water systems are operating optimally, there is enough going through the pipes at a high enough pressure that debris from outside the pipe can't make its way inside. Essentially, there's so much water going through so quickly that even if there is a crack in the pipe, the water can act as a barrier. But as soon as that pressure drops or there's less water going through the pipes, there is suddenly room for soil, debris and chemical residue to sneak into the drinking water.

And because of the leakage issues, the Water District hasn't been able to flush the water lines clean in years, said Joe Burns of the Kentucky Rural Water Association. ""As far as systematic lines, it's been years since it's even been able to be accomplished.""

Burns' group is working with the Martin County Water District to help make improvements as best as they can. They've been able to reduce the levels of byproduct contaminants to under federal limits by simply changing where they add the chlorine.

But on top of issues with the lines, there are upgrades to the water treatment facilities, pumps and meters that still need to be made.

Investments in hardware and software are needed

For a financially struggling municipality, it is hard to find resources outside raising water rates, which is difficult for a community of people who mostly live on a limited income.

Infrastructure isn't just pipes and hardware, Ormsbee said; it also includes financial and technical management.

Small water systems, such as Martin County, that serve less than 10,000 customers supply water to nearly 20% of the country . In addition to infrastructure and financial challenges, many of these systems can have a difficult time attracting the technical expertise to help. In fact, small systems made up 72% of EPA violations in 2015 and 2016.

Some citizens in Martin County feel that they've been forgotten. ""Appalachia has been at the forefront in helping to improve this country for many years. ... We've sent people to die in all of our country's wars. We've populated this country with people in all industries,"" Lafferty said. ""We are Americans, too.""

Ball points to a new government center and a business complex in Inez, the county seat. The cost is nearly $20 million, money that he said could have been spent on upgrading the water system.

Some relief

Recently, Martin County received federal grants amounting to $3.4 million to go toward its water system. Experts believe that overhauling the system would take $13.5 million to $15 million.

President Trump's infrastructure proposal gives some residents hope. The $1.5 trillion plan touted by the White House is supposed to cover all infrastructure upgrades in the nation, but experts believe that it would cost the country $1 trillion just to maintain and meet the demands for drinking water for the next 25 years.

Critics further point out the White House's plan earmarks only $200 billion in federal investment. The remainder is to be made up by the states and the private sector.

""Time will tell,"" Lafferty said. ""Politicians should remember that 'forgotten people' usually have long memories."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180330100524-martin-county-water-super-tease.jpg
e9009f52d14e458b96987cf7fae3f6b0	['Jessica Ravitz', 'Cnn Illustrations India Hayes']	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Inside the secret lives of functioning heroin addicts	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Inside the secret lives of functioning heroin addicts	1	"(CNN) They're not slumped over in alleyways with used needles by their sides. Their dignity, at least from outside appearances, remains intact. They haven't lost everything while chasing an insatiable high.

They are functioning heroin addicts -- people who hold down jobs, pay the bills and fool their families.

For some, addiction is genetic; they're wired this way. For others, chronic pain and lack of legal opioids landed them here. Or experimentation got them hooked and changed everything.

What addicts have in common, according to experts, is a disease that has more to do with their brains than the substances they use. About 85% of people can take a pain pill, for example, and never crave it again.

This is a story about the others, those traveling the dangerous road of functional addiction. What works for them now, experts explain, can easily and lethally be derailed.

Hanging in the balance are people you may never imagine: peers, co-workers and neighbors. Loved ones, bosses and teachers. Respected members of your community who, for the benefit of everyone's understanding, want to be heard.

After CNN gave voice last fall to addicts on skid row , the sorts we think of when we picture ""heroin addict,"" I set out to tell this overlooked part of the heroin story.

Being a functioning addict hinges on heroin use staying hush-hush, so we agreed to change the names of those willing to open up.

'All smiles and happiness at work'

Loving and successful parents, good schools, a great upbringing in the Midwest: Todd can't point to anything that drove him to drugs. He was a typical suburban high school student who dabbled in weed. Then, at 15, he popped a Percocet his mother left lying around while she was recovering from surgery.

""The feeling in my head was, 'I want to feel like this for the rest of my life,' "" Todd says. ""It was the perfect drug for me.""

The 11 years since have been a dance with opioid addiction, even as he graduated from college and embarked on a successful career in corporate management. Now 26, he has gone stretches where he's been sober, but the pull is strong and keeps yanking him back.

He's done heroin for periods of time and says it's ""fantastic,"" but shooting up isn't his style. His preference, assuming he can find them, is to buy more expensive opioids. For a long time, OxyContin was his drug of choice; now he prefers Opana and, if he can't get that, Subutex.

He makes good money, which means he can afford his $350- to $600-a-week habit.

He's figured out how much to take so he doesn't feel the pains of withdrawal, which is now his goal -- rather than getting a full-on high. His sweet spot: 60 milligrams of Opana.

""I don't know how to describe withdrawal. It's like the worst flu you've ever had in your life -- and then multiply that by 1,000,"" he says. ""There's a scraping inside your brain. You're willing to do anything to feel better.""

To avoid that hell, Todd often lives a lie. He's ""all smiles and happiness at work,"" he says, and he spins tales to guard his secret. He might say he's in one city when he's really in another. That quick trip he says he's taking to McDonald's could be to meet his dealer at Burger King. When he's used heroin, he's explained the bruises on his arm by telling people he has diabetes or an infectious disease. He once told a pharmacist he was a science teacher in need of syringes for experiments. He's invented the deaths of family members to get days off.

But death is very much a reality in his life.

His last serious girlfriend also used drugs and died from an overdose. Over the past six years, he's lost seven people he cares about to addiction.

He'd like to find love, build a relationship and have a family but says, ""It would be dishonest, and I never want to hurt anybody. That's the biggest problem.""

He knows that he has a lot to live for, but he often forgets that and struggles to imagine a future. And because he can't stray far from his dealer, a dream he does have remains on hold indefinitely.

""I've always wanted to see the world,"" he says. ""I've never been outside the country because I can't leave. I'm f***ing chained where I'm at. It's a f***ing prison.""

The sign of an addict

The sensation Todd had the first time he popped a Percocet, that feeling he wanted to hold onto for the rest of his life, was the giveaway. He, like 10% or 15% of people, has the disease of addiction, explains Dr. Stuart Gitlow, past president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine

What offers no special high for most people or may even make them feel queasy became Todd's aspiration. And part of the problem, says Gitlow, is that ""you don't know in advance what person you're going to be.""

Todd may be functioning now, but Gitlow warns that tolerances and doses often change. As an addictive disease progresses, it is also influenced by life events and stressors. What happens if Todd loses his job someday or can't afford his preferred pills?

""They all start out functioning,"" he says. ""The bulk of people taking heroin are probably functioning. It's only in the end stage that they're nodding off in an alley and have a pretty good shot of dying.""

What Todd needs, Gitlow says, is help from a doctor who is certified in addiction medicine and can treat his disease. The vast majority, or 80%, of those who seek appropriate treatment and adhere to their treatment recommendations do well, he says.

Not a unique story

It didn't start with a pill for Lisa. Her first addiction took hold at 12, when she began cutting herself.

Carving into her flesh released dopamine in her brain, giving her a high, she says. The first time she did it, she never anticipated a rush. She was overwhelmed emotionally and simply acting out. But cutting became her way to self-medicate because it offered her solace, easing the emotional pain of living in a household full of screaming.

Now, at 23, Lisa opts for heroin. And because of it and other opioids she's used, ""I hurt myself a lot less.""

The difference now is that she, like Todd, no longer seeks a high. When she shoots up each morning, she insists, ""I just do enough to stay well"" through the day and not feel physical pain.

She works hard, always has. She excelled in her college-prep private school, where she was dubbed ""gifted and talented,"" she says. She takes her job as a store manager seriously and enjoys a supportive marriage. No one at work knows that her day begins with a call to her dealer. If she has track marks, a simple long-sleeved shirt hides the evidence.

How she found heroin, she says, is not unique.

Long plagued by tendonitis in her knees and two herniated discs in her back, Lisa tried everything. Steroid injections gave her migraines, and her stomach couldn't handle anti-inflammatories. Physical and aquatic therapies offered little relief, as did deep-tissue massage. Finally, four years ago, a physician wrote out a prescription for pain pills.

She found comfort in those legal opioids. But then came the crackdown on opioid prescriptions, she says, effectively ending her lawful pain management.

Once her pills ran out, she turned to buying them on the street. They were hard to find, though, and the cost became prohibitive. An old friend, a heroin user, suggested that she give his drug a try.

""I can't find pills, I'm in pain, and it's really cheap,"" she remembers telling herself. ""What happened to me is what happened to thousands and thousands of people.""

Where she lives in Texas, near the Mexican border, the price of heroin can't be beat. One pill might cost her $50, but she can get half a gram of heroin, which is far more potent, for $20. The same product, she says, would cost up to five times as much in other parts of the country.

""If I moved somewhere where it was $100,"" she says, ""I'd quit.""

Her husband doesn't do drugs. He barely drinks. And although he'd prefer she kick the habit altogether, he's committed to being by her side -- so much that he keeps Narcan, the overdose antidote drug, in their home and has watched training videos to learn how to administer it in case she overdoses.

""He loves me enough that he's willing to stay with me,"" Lisa says. ""That's a key component to keeping me from going off the deep end.""

Lisa says a small handful of friends know that she uses heroin. Everyone else, her family included, believes she's hooked on ""just pills."" It's easier that way. Pills and other vices don't come with the same sort of judgment.

""People drink, and we think nothing of it. You do heroin, and you're the scum of the earth,"" she says. ""People will cut you out of their lives.""

Everybody's problem

Heroin users weren't always ""the scum of the earth."" In the late 19th century, it was a trademark name for an over-the-counter drug made by Bayer.

Today, there are politics behind which drugs are demonized and which aren't, and much of that is rooted in racism, says Dr. Michael Miller, who preceded Gitlow as president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.

White socialites snorting cocaine in an Aspen ski lodge are forgiven, while inner-city blacks smoking crack -- just another form of cocaine -- are vilified and locked away, Miller explains. Heroin was romanticized when musicians used it, he says, but after black kids in coastal cities got hold of it, the perception changed and stuck.

Now, with the explosion of the opioid epidemic and the emergence of heroin as a less expensive alternative, it's become everybody's problem -- white or black, rich or poor, on the coasts or in middle America, no matter whether you live in a city, suburb or rural community.

That's how Lisa got roped in and learned to keep a secret.

She admits that the management of her addiction hinges in large part on her husband being by her side. But what if he leaves? What if life tosses her another kind of doozy? How much heroin would she need to ease her pain then?

""She has no coping skills. She's right at the edge,"" Gitlow says. ""What if her dealer gets arrested and her new dealer mixes in fentanyl? Boom. She's dead.""

'Like downing a beer'

Not everyone I spoke to considers themselves addicts. Enter Matthew.

For as long as Matthew can remember, he's battled anxiety and depression. Beyond prescriptions like Xanax or Valium, he began self-medicating at 19 with marijuana and LSD, he says.

An arrest for possession of pot and LSD with intent to distribute landed him on probation. Facing regular drug tests that would detect cannabis, he turned to harder drugs that wouldn't stay in his urine as long. That's how Matthew, 28, first tried oxycodone.

Later, a doctor would prescribe opioids for chronic stomach pain, a condition he's had for six years.

It's the sort of pain, he says, that used to leave him racing to bathrooms so frequently, he couldn't keep a job. Multiple GI doctors have tried to help him. Only prescribed opioids and marijuana have offered relief.

Raised in the Eastern US, he now lives in rural Northern California and works as a consultant in the cannabis industry. He doesn't hide his marijuana use or his dependence on pain medications.

It's the powdered heroin he purchases on the dark net, the stuff he snorts in the bathroom a few times a day, that he keeps to himself. He says he uses it only when his prescriptions or insurance coverage lapse.

He's never used heroin intravenously. Having gone back and forth between pharmaceuticals and illegal supplies, he says he's able to use a milligram scale to carefully measure how much of the powder to take.

""It's similar to a dose of Percocet."" he says. ""The effect would be like downing a beer or a cocktail.""

He doesn't use a lot and says he snorts only about $5 of heroin a day. He's stopped in spurts and has written down pro and con lists to see whether he can move on. The pros keep winning out.

""I just don't find sober me is the best me,"" he says.

Having a secret can be isolating, he says, but otherwise, heroin has not hindered his life. Rather, Matthew says, ""It's changed my life for the better.""

Not only does it help with the pain, he says, it constipates him, allowing him to ditch the bathroom and get out of the house.

""I'm dependent,"" he says. ""But I wouldn't necessarily call myself an addict.""

The crippling truth

Matthew is kidding himself, experts say.

""Denial is a crippling component of addictive disease,"" Gitlow said. ""Here we have a well-documented illustration of that deadly component.""

Starting at 19, the signs were there when Matthew turned to drugs rather than ""conventional coping mechanisms,"" Gitlow explains. Someone without the addictive disease might have tried those drugs for temporary relief but then realized they weren't worth the long-term risk.

Matthew's belief that he doesn't have a problem, Gitlow says, is no different from a man with hypertension or diabetes pretending there's nothing wrong with him.

Plus, using heroin and other opioids changes brain chemistry, says Siobhan Morse, director of clinical services for the Foundations Recovery Network.

The natural way a body manages pain or stress, Morse says, is by producing endorphins.

""If you're giving it the artificial substance,"" she explains, the brain thinks it doesn't have to make the real thing. ""So when you take away the artificial substance, everything is so painful.""

And for people like Matthew who have coexisting mental health issues such as anxiety or depression, self-medication with opioids can make those matters worse, Morse adds. She describes the combination as a ""moving target.""

Eventually, she and other experts say, Matthew's drug use will catch up with him.

""I've never met anyone who's indefinitely held it down being a heroin addict,"" Morse says.

The fall of 'Superwoman'

Rebecca has been using for more than three decades -- longer than Matthew, Todd and Lisa combined. She is surprised to still be alive.

She grew up in an upper-middle-class household in a tony suburb in the South where she was raised more by the housekeeper than her parents. Her mother was checked out; her father had mistresses and often traveled.

""I didn't have any boundaries,"" says Rebecca, 59. ""I could do whatever I wanted, which was a recipe for disaster.""

Starting at 12, she tried every narcotic she could find. At 15, the man who was her drug dealer and boyfriend introduced her to heroin.

""I was in love,"" she says of the drug. ""It became the love of my life.""

One day, she was sleeping on the couch in her family's home when an older sister pinned her down, rolled up one of her sleeves and called out her track marks.

""Mom didn't bat an eye,"" Rebecca remembers. Instead, she shrugged it off, saying, ""Jewish people aren't addicts.""

Her father, when he was around, was more a friend than a parent. He partied with Rebecca and gave her Quaaludes, she says.

Rebecca eventually married the drug dealer-boyfriend, and they had a daughter. But the marriage was short-lived.

Divorced and 24, Rebecca went into treatment after her daughter turned 3. Rebecca knew that she was unfit to be a parent and feared she'd lose her daughter forever. It was the first of some 20 times she'd check into a treatment facility for help.

Along the way, she re-married; husband No. 2 died of a heroin overdose.

Rebecca met her third husband in treatment and stayed sober for eight years. They had two more children and a comfortable lifestyle, enjoying the sort of privileges she knew growing up. But when this marriage fell apart, so did she.

""That was when I started to spiral down,"" Rebecca says. ""As soon as I started using, it was immediate. ... It was like I never stopped using.""

Even as Rebecca returned to heroin, spending $100 or more a day, she built a career in corporate travel, working for big-name companies.

""As long as I didn't run out [of heroin] and get sick, I was like Superwoman,"" she says of her job performance. ""If I had come in and said I was a heroin addict, people would have laughed.""

Years of use caught up with her. Lunchtime runs to see her dealer grew longer and became lies about flat tires or broken-down cars. She bounced around between five or six companies, taking extended leaves to go into treatment or try to detox at home. She kept overdosing. A $30,000 mistake at work got her fired.

""People kept saying, 'You're going to die,' "" Rebecca says. ""The problem with me wasn't that I was going to die, it's that I was going to live.""

Her kids were mostly raised by other family members and knew her at her worst. They'd see her after overdoses and visit her in the ""nasty places"" she called home. ""It was just awful,"" says Rebecca, who's still working to repair the relationships she frayed.

Today, Rebecca is three years sober.

The last time she entered treatment, she says, ""something clicked, and I remember thinking, 'I can't do this anymore.' ""

She was ""sick and tired of being sick and tired,"" she says. ""I didn't have it in me anymore to keep doing what it took to stay high.""

Rebecca is not the only member of her family who's struggled. One relative is an alcoholic, another is also a heroin addict, and a third -- who won't touch heroin because of Rebecca -- is hooked on pain pills.

""It's in the genes,"" Rebecca says. ""No doubt.""

She has seven grandchildren and is determined to be a better grandmother than she was a parent. She lives with a friend in an apartment and works part time for a sober living community.

""If there's any regret, it's that I've missed decades,"" Rebecca says. ""I just thought I wasn't going to live, so I never worried about getting old.""

8f32c859d8474f139ce6181971882a60	['Story Aaron Kessler', 'Elizabeth Cohen', 'Katherine Grise', 'Cnn Video Elizabeth Cohen', 'John Bonifield']	2018-03-11 00:00:00	For doctors, more opioid prescriptions bring more money	https://www.cnn.com/	US	For doctors, more opioid prescriptions bring more money	1	"(CNN) As tens of thousands of Americans die from prescription opioid overdoses each year, an exclusive analysis by CNN and researchers at Harvard University found that opioid manufacturers are paying physicians huge sums of money -- and the more opioids a doctor prescribes, the more money he or she makes.

In 2014 and 2015, opioid manufacturers paid hundreds of doctors across the country six-figure sums for speaking, consulting and other services. Thousands of other doctors were paid over $25,000 during that time.

Physicians who prescribed particularly large amounts of the drugs were the most likely to get paid.

""This is the first time we've seen this, and it's really important,"" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a senior scientist at the Institute for Behavioral Health at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, where he is co-director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative.

""It smells like doctors being bribed to sell narcotics, and that's very disturbing,"" said Kolodny, who is also the executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing.

The Harvard researchers said it's not clear whether the payments encourage doctors to prescribe a company's drug or whether pharmaceutical companies seek out and reward doctors who are already high prescribers.

""I don't know if the money is causing the prescribing or the prescribing led to the money, but in either case, it's potentially a vicious cycle. It's cementing the idea for these physicians that prescribing this many opioids is creating value,"" said Dr. Michael Barnett, assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

CNN spoke with two women who've struggled with opioid addiction, and they described the sense of betrayal they felt when they learned that their doctors had received large sums of money from the manufacturers of the drugs that had created such havoc in their lives.

Carey Ballou said she trusted her doctor and figured that if he was prescribing opioids, it must be because they were the best option for her pain.

Then she learned that opioid manufacturers paid her doctor more than a million dollars over two years.

""Once I found out he was being paid, I thought, 'was it really in my best interest, or was it in his best interest?' "" she said.

To do the analysis, CNN -- along with Barnett and Harvard's Dr. Anupam Jena -- examined two federal government databases. One tracks payments by drug companies to doctors, and the other tracks prescriptions that doctors write to Medicare recipients.

The CNN/Harvard analysis looked at 2014 and 2015, during which time more than 811,000 doctors wrote prescriptions to Medicare patients. Of those, nearly half wrote at least one prescription for opioids.

Fifty-four percent of those doctors -- more than 200,000 physicians -- received a payment from pharmaceutical companies that make opioids.

Doctors were more likely to get paid by drug companies if they prescribed a lot of opioids -- and they were more likely to get paid a lot of money.

Among doctors in the top 25th percentile of opioid prescribers by volume, 72% received payments. Among those in the top fifth percentile, 84% received payments. Among the very biggest prescribers -- those in the top 10th of 1% -- 95% received payments.

On average, doctors whose opioid prescription volume ranked among the top 5% nationally received twice as much money from the opioid manufacturers, compared with doctors whose prescription volume was in the median. Doctors in the top 1% of opioid prescribers received on average four times as much money as the typical doctor. Doctors in the top 10th of 1%, on average, received nine times more money than the typical doctor.

""The correlation you found is very powerful,"" said David Rothman, director of the Center on Medicine as a Profession at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. ""What's amazing about the findings is not simply that money counts but that more money counts even more.""

Paying doctors for speaking, consulting and other services is legal. It's defended as a way for experts in their fields to share important experience and information about medications, but it has long been a controversial practice.

Pharmaceutical company payments to doctors are not unique to opioids. Drug companies pay doctors billions of dollars for various services. In 2015, 48% of physicians received some pharmaceutical payment

Dr. Steven Stanos, president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, said he wasn't surprised that doctors who frequently prescribe a drug are often chosen and paid to give speeches about the drug to other doctors.

""They know those medicines, and so they're going to be more likely to prescribe those because they have a better understanding,"" Stanos said, adding that some of the money paid to doctors may have been to teach other doctors about new ""abuse-deterrent"" opioid drugs.

Stanos' group accepted nearly $1.2 million from five of the largest opioid manufacturers in the United States between 2012 and 2017, according to a recent report by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

Stanos said the money was used for various projects, including courses on safe opioid prescribing.

""I would obviously hope that a physician would not prescribe based on some type of kickback or anything like that, that they'd obviously be prescribing [in] the best interest of the patient,"" he said.

But Dr. Daniel Carlat, former director of the Prescription Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said the CNN and Harvard findings are in line with other studies suggesting that money from drug companies does influence a doctor's prescribing habits.

""It's not proof positive, but it's another very significant data point in the growing evidence base that marketing payments from drug companies are not good for medicine and not good for patient care,"" said Carlat, a psychiatrist who blogs about conflicts of interest. ""It makes me extremely concerned.""

Barnett, one of the Harvard researchers who worked with CNN, said pharmaceutical companies pay doctors for a reason.

""It's not like they're spending this money and just letting it go out into the ether,"" he said. ""They wouldn't be spending this money if it weren't effective.""

According to a statement by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, drug companies support mandatory and ongoing training for prescribers on the appropriate treatment of pain.

""PhRMA supports a number of policies to ensure patients' legitimate medical needs are met, while establishing safeguards that prevent overprescribing,"" according to the statement from the group.

Angela Cantone at her home in Greenville, South Carolina.

'I trusted my doctor'

Angela Cantone says she wishes she had known that opioid manufacturers were paying her doctor hundreds of thousands of dollars; it might have prompted her to question his judgment.

She says Dr. Aathirayen Thiyagarajah, a pain specialist in Greenville, South Carolina, prescribed her an opioid called Subsys for abdominal pain from Crohn's disease for nearly 2½ years, from March 2013 through July 2015.

Subsys is an ultrapowerful form of fentanyl, which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

""He said it would do wonders for me, and it was really simple and easy. You just spray it in your mouth,"" Cantone said.

She says Subsys helped her pain, but it left her in ""a zombie-like"" state. She couldn't be left alone with her three young children, two of whom have autism and other special needs.

""I blacked out all the time. I'd find myself on the kitchen floor or the front lawn,"" she said.

She says that if she missed even one day of the drug, she had uncontrollable diarrhea and vomiting.

She said she brought her concerns to Thiyagarajah, but he assured her it couldn't be the Subsys that was causing her health problems.

""I trusted him. I trusted my doctor as you trust the police officer that's directing traffic when the light is out,"" she said.

She says that when she eventually asked Thiyagarajah to switch her to a non-opioid medication, he became belligerent.

""He said it was Subsys or nothing,"" she said.

Angela Cantone holds an opioid called Subsys that her doctor prescribed to treat her prain from Crohn's disease.

Cantone would later learn that from August 2013 through December 2016, the company that makes Subsys paid Thiyagarajah more than $200,000, according to Open Payments , the federal government database that tracks payments from pharmaceutical companies to doctors.

CNN compared the $190,000 he received from 2014 to 2015 with other prescribers nationwide in the same medical specialty and found that he received magnitudes more than the average for his peers.

Nearly all of the payments were for fees for speaking, training, education and consulting.

Cantone is now suing Thiyagarajah, accusing him of setting out to ""defraud and deceive"" her for ""the sole purpose of increasing prescriptions, sales, and consumption of Subsys to increase ... profits.""

Through his attorney, Thiyagarajah denied any wrongdoing but declined to comment on this story due to the pending litigation.

In a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit, Thiyagarajah denied all of the allegations against him and said that all medical care provided to Cantone was ""reasonable and appropriate and in keeping with the standard of care.""

His attorney, E. Brown Parkinson, said the doctor is currently practicing medicine, alternating weeks between his practices in South Carolina and New York.

Thiyagarajah might be expected to write a relatively high number of prescriptions for opioid painkillers, given that he's board-certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation with a subspecialty in pain medicine.

But he wrote an unusually high number of prescriptions for Subsys and other opioids even when compared with other doctors with the same certifications.

In 2014 and 2015, physicians with Thiyagarajah's certifications wrote an average of 3.7 opioid prescriptions per Medicare patient per year, according to the analysis by CNN and Harvard. Thiyagarajah, however, annually wrote more than seven opioid prescriptions per patient per year.

After about two years on Subsys, Cantone says, she took herself off the drug cold turkey.

According to an affidavit by an investigator for the Drug Enforcement Administration, Thiyagarajah's office was inspected by the agency in June 2015 and found to be prescribing another opioid, buprenorphine, ""for non-legitimate medical need"" in violation of federal law.

In March 2016, the agent conducted another inspection and seized 45 medical records related to Subsys.

The DEA did a compliance review and referred its findings to the Department of Health and Human Services, according to Robert Murphy, associate special agent in charge of the agency's Atlanta Field Division.

Cantone is also suing Insys, the company that makes Subsys. Insys denied allegations of wrongdoing in a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit.

Separate from Cantone's lawsuit, John Kapoor, the founder and largest shareholder of Insys, was arrested and arraigned in federal court in October on charges of bribing doctors to overprescribe the drug.

""Dr. Kapoor engaged in no wrongdoing and refutes all of the charges in the strongest possible terms,"" said Tom Becker, a spokesman for Kapoor. ""He looks forward to being fully vindicated after having his day in court.""

Kapoor resigned from the Insys board of directors in October, according to a company news release

Several other Insys executives were arrested in connection with an alleged racketeering scheme.

Separately, Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, is conducting an investigation into the opioid industry.

According to her investigation and the federal indictment, Insys used a combination of tactics , such as falsifying medical records, misleading insurance companies and providing kickbacks to doctors in league with the company.

Saeed Motahari, president and CEO of Insys, wrote a letter in September to McCaskill, noting that he was ""concerned about certain mistakes and unacceptable actions of former Insys employees."" He added that most of the field-based sales staff were no longer with the company.

""I stand with you and share the desire to address the serious national challenge related to the misuse and abuse of opioids that has led to addiction and unnecessary deaths and has caused so much pain to families and communities around the country,"" Motahari added.

The analysis

Sometimes, pharmaceutical companies pay doctors to do medical research. They also pay doctors for promotional work: for example, to speak with other doctors about the benefits of a drug.

Among the doctors who prescribe the highest volume of opioids, the CNN/Harvard analysis found that the largest amount of money was paid for that second category, which includes speaking fees, consulting, travel and food.

Concerns about payments to doctors by opioid manufacturers were brought to light last year in a study by researchers at Boston University.

Several studies published in medical journals in recent years have found an association between payments by pharmaceutical companies for various types of drugs and doctors' prescribing habits.

For example, researchers at the University of North Carolina examined the two government databases analyzed by CNN and Harvard and found that when doctors received payments from manufacturers of certain cancer drugs, they were more likely to prescribe those drugs to their patients.

""This study suggests that conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry may influence oncologists in high-stakes treatment decisions for patients with cancer,"" the authors concluded.

Dr. Patrice Harris, a spokeswoman for the American Medical Association, said that the CNN and Harvard data raised ""fair questions"" but that such analyses show only an association between payments and prescribing habits and don't prove that one causes the other.

It's ""not a cause and effect relationship,"" said Harris, chairwoman of the association's opioid task force, adding that more research should be done on the relationship between payments and prescriptions.

""[We] strongly oppose inappropriate, unethical interactions between physicians and industry,"" she added. ""But we know that not all interactions are unethical or inappropriate.""

Harris added that relationships between doctors and industry are ethical and appropriate if they ""can help drive innovation in patient care and provide significant resources for professional medical education that ultimately benefits patients.""

Stanos, the pain physician, said a doctor who gets paid by a pharmaceutical company and prescribes that company's drug might truly and legitimately believe that the drug is the best option for the patient.

""I hope physicians that do promotional talks prescribe because they think the medicine has a benefit,"" he said.

But Jena, one of the two Harvard researchers who collaborated on the CNN analysis, said he worries that money from opioid manufacturers -- especially large amounts of money -- could influence a doctor to prescribe opioids over less dangerous options.

""Every decision, every recommendation a physician makes, should be in the best interest of the patient and not a combination of the patient's interest and the financial interest of the doctor,"" said Jena, associate professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.

""If we lived in a different world where none of these payments to physicians occurred, how many fewer Americans would have [been prescribed] opioids, and how many fewer deaths would have occurred?"" he asked.

From 1999 to 2015, more than 183,000 people in the United States died from overdoses related to prescription opioids, according to the CDC . In October, President Donald Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national public health emergency

At least one company has decided to stop paying doctors for promotional activities such as speaking engagements.

Purdue Pharma discontinued its speakers program for the opioids OxyContin and Butrans at the end of 2016 and the program for Hysingla, another opioid, in November, according to company spokesman Robert Josephson.

""We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers,"" a company statement said.

More than $1 million in three years

Though Thiyagarajah's opioid prescription rates were particularly high, many other doctors who have prescribed large amounts of opioids have also been paid large amounts of money by pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs.

Several patients have filed lawsuits against these high prescribers.

From August 2013 through December 2016, Dr. Steven Simon of Overland Park, Kansas, was paid nearly $1.1 million by companies that make opioid painkillers, according to the federal Open Payments database

Most of the payments were fees for speaking, training and education.

Ballou, one of his patients, says she remembers Simon bragging about how drug companies were flying him across the country to give lectures to other doctors.

""He said he was going to Miami, and they were going to give him a convertible, and he was going to stay in the best hotel and eat the best Cuban food he'd ever had,"" said Ballou, who filed a lawsuit against Simon after she says she became addicted to opioids.

Simon's lawyer, James Wyrsch, said he would not comment on pending litigation.

In court documents, he asked for the case to be dismissed, saying in part that Ballou's complaints that Simon improperly prescribed Subsys were ""simply incorrect.""

Bridget Patton, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Kansas City field office, said federal agents went to the office where Simon works, Mid-America PolyClinic, in July.

The clinic said in a statement that it is ""fully and willingly cooperating with all investigations"" and that Simon has not been employed there since July 24.

""We had a lawful presence at that facility,"" Patton said. She declined to say whether investigating Simon himself was the purpose of the FBI visit.

The owner of the pain clinic, Dr. Srinivas Nalamachu, told The Kansas City Star that the agents showed up with a search warrant for Simon's medical records involving fentanyl prescriptions.

Simon and his lawyer told CNN they couldn't comment due to the pending litigation.

Ballou said that when she was Simon's patient, it didn't give her pause that the same doctor who was prescribing opioids to her was also taking money from the companies that made the drugs.

But now she looks back with anger.

A Mother's Day card Angela Cantone's daugher made for her reads, ""Best of all mother likes to sleep,"" alluding to the many instances when Cantone says her opioid medication caused her to pass out.

Cantone, the patient who went to Thiyagarajah, the pain specialist in South Carolina, looks back with sadness.

She cries as she remembers the Mother's Day card her daughter made her in preschool. The teacher asked each child what their mother liked to do and wrote it on the card.

Her card said her mother liked to sleep.

""Instead of saying 'she gives me hugs and kisses or takes me to the park,' it was the years of her finding me on the floor,"" Cantone said. ""I feel like I failed as a parent.""

She becomes angry when she thinks about the hundreds of thousands of dollars her doctor was paid by the drug company.

""The medication that was being prescribed to me was for his benefit, not my own,"" she said."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180309151401-prescription-opioid-payments-illustration-super-tease.jpg
80ca8b1764f7467abed3f419faa32211	['Story Wayne Drash', 'Cnn Video Elizabeth Cohen', 'John Bonifield']	2018-02-11 00:00:00	State launches Aetna probe after stunning admission	https://www.cnn.com/	US	State launches Aetna probe after stunning admission	1	"(CNN) California's insurance commissioner has launched an investigation into Aetna after learning a former medical director for the insurer admitted under oath he never looked at patients' records when deciding whether to approve or deny care.

California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones expressed outrage after CNN showed him a transcript of the testimony and said his office is looking into how widespread the practice is within Aetna.

""If the health insurer is making decisions to deny coverage without a physician actually ever reviewing medical records, that's of significant concern to me as insurance commissioner in California -- and potentially a violation of law,"" he said.

Aetna, the nation's third-largest insurance provider with 23.1 million customers, told CNN it looked forward to ""explaining our clinical review process"" to the commissioner.

The California probe centers on a deposition by Dr. Jay Ken Iinuma, who served as medical director for Aetna for Southern California from March 2012 to February 2015, according to the insurer.

During the deposition, the doctor said he was following Aetna's training, in which nurses reviewed records and made recommendations to him.

Jones said his expectation would be ""that physicians would be reviewing treatment authorization requests,"" and that it's troubling that ""during the entire course of time he was employed at Aetna, he never once looked at patients' medical records himself.""

""It's hard to imagine that in that entire course in time, there weren't any cases in which a decision about the denial of coverage ought to have been made by someone trained as a physician, as opposed to some other licensed professional,"" Jones told CNN.

""That's why we've contacted Aetna and asked that they provide us information about how they are making these claims decisions and why we've opened this investigation.""

The insurance commissioner said Californians who believe they may have been adversely affected by Aetna's decisions should contact his office

Members of the medical community expressed similar shock, saying Iinuma's deposition leads to questions about Aetna's practices across the country.

""Oh my God. Are you serious? That is incredible,"" said Dr. Anne-Marie Irani when told of the medical director's testimony. Irani is a professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU and a former member of the American Board of Allergy and Immunology's board of directors.

""This is potentially a huge, huge story and quite frankly may reshape how insurance functions,"" said Dr. Andrew Murphy, who, like Irani, is a renowned fellow of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. He recently served on the academy's board of directors.

The Gillen Washington case

Gillen Washington, 23, says he hopes to force change at Aetna.

The deposition by Aetna's former medical director came as part of a lawsuit filed against Aetna by a college student who suffers from a rare immune disorder. The case is expected to go to trial later this week in California Superior Court.

Gillen Washington, 23, is suing Aetna for breach of contract and bad faith, saying he was denied coverage for an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) when he was 19. His suit alleges Aetna's ""reckless withholding of benefits almost killed him.""

Aetna has rejected the allegations, saying Washington failed to comply with their requests for blood work. Washington, who was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency, or CVID, in high school, became a new Aetna patient in January 2014 after being insured by Kaiser.

Aetna initially paid for his treatments after each infusion, which can cost up to $20,000. But when Washington's clinic asked Aetna to pre-authorize a November 2014 infusion, Aetna says it was obligated to review his medical record. That's when it saw his last blood work had been done three years earlier for Kaiser.

Despite being told by his own doctor's office that he needed to come in for new blood work, Washington failed to do so for several months until he got so sick he ended up in the hospital with a collapsed lung.

Once his blood was tested, Aetna resumed covering his infusions and pre-certified him for a year. Despite that, according to Aetna, Washington continued to miss infusions.

Washington's suit counters that Aetna ignored his treating physician, who appealed on his behalf months before his hospitalization that the treatment was medically necessary ""to prevent acute and long-term problems.""

""Aetna is blaming me for what happened,"" Washington told CNN. ""I'll just be honest, it's infuriating to me. I want Aetna to be made to change.""

During his videotaped deposition in October 2016, Iinuma -- who signed the pre-authorization denial -- said he never read Washington's medical records and knew next to nothing about his disorder.

Intravenous immunoglobulin can cost as much as $20,000 per treatment. It helps patients like Gillen Washington stave off infection.

Questioned about Washington's condition, Iinuma said he wasn't sure what the drug of choice would be for people who suffer from his condition.

Iinuma further says he's not sure what the symptoms are for the disorder or what might happen if treatment is suddenly stopped for a patient.

""Do I know what happens?"" the doctor said. ""Again, I'm not sure. ... I don't treat it.""

Iinuma said he never looked at a patient's medical records while at Aetna. He says that was Aetna protocol and that he based his decision off ""pertinent information"" provided to him by a nurse.

""Did you ever look at medical records?"" Scott Glovsky, Washington's attorney, asked Iinuma in the deposition.

""No, I did not,"" the doctor says, shaking his head.

""So as part of your custom and practice in making decisions, you would rely on what the nurse had prepared for you?"" Glovsky asks.

""Correct.""

Iinuma said nearly all of his work was conducted online. Once in a while, he said, he might place a phone call to the nurse for more details.

How many times might he call a nurse over the course of a month?

""Zero to one,"" he said.

Glovsky told CNN he had ""never heard such explosive testimony in two decades of deposing insurance company review doctors.""

Aetna's response

Aetna defended Iinuma, who is no longer with the company, saying in its legal brief that he relied on his ""years of experience"" as a trained physician in making his decision about Washington's treatment and that he was following Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletin appropriately.

""Dr. Iinuma's decision was correct,"" Aetna said in court papers. ""Plaintiff has asserted throughout this litigation that Dr. Iinuma had no medical basis for his decision that 2011 lab tests were outdated and that Dr. Iinuma's decision was incorrect. Plaintiff is wrong on both counts.""

Gillen Washington receives an infusion of the medicine needed to boost his immune system. He calls it ""the magic juice.""

In its trial brief, Aetna said: ""Given that Aetna does not directly provide medical care to its members, Aetna needs to obtain medical records from members and their doctors to evaluate whether services are 'medically necessary.' Aetna employs nurses to gather the medical records and coordinate with the offices of treating physicians, and Aetna employs doctors to make the actual coverage-related determinations.

""In addition to applying their clinical judgment, the Aetna doctors and nurses use Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletins ('CPBs') to determine what medical records to request, and whether those records satisfy medical necessity criteria to support coverage. These CPBs reflect the current standard of care in the medical community. They are frequently updated, and are publicly available for any treating physician to review.""

Jones, the California insurance commissioner, said he couldn't comment specifically on Washington's case, but what drew his interest was the medical director's admission of not looking at patients' medical records.

""What I'm responding to is the portion of his deposition transcript in which he said as the medical director, he wasn't actually reviewing medical records,"" Jones told CNN.

He said his investigation will review every individual denial of coverage or pre-authorization during the medical director's tenure to determine ""whether it was appropriate or not for that decision to be made by someone other than a physician.""

If the probe determines that violations occurred, he said, California insurance code sets monetary penalties for each individual violation.

CNN has made numerous phone calls to Iinuma's office for comment but has not heard back. Heather Richardson, an attorney representing Aetna, declined to answer any questions.

Asked about the California investigation, Aetna gave this written statement to CNN:

""We have yet to hear from Commissioner Jones but look forward to explaining our clinical review process.

""Aetna medical directors are trained to review all available medical information -- including medical records -- to make an informed decision. As part of our review process, medical directors are provided all submitted medical records, and also receive a case synopsis and review performed by a nurse.

""Medical directors -- and all of our clinicians -- take their duties and responsibilities as medical professionals incredibly seriously. Similar to most other clinical environments, our medical directors work collaboratively with our nurses who are involved in these cases and factor in their input as part of the decision-making process.""

Gillen Washington became emaciated and gravely ill after four months without treatment.

'A huge admission'

Dr. Arthur Caplan, founding director of the division of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, described Iinuma's testimony as ""a huge admission of fundamental immorality.""

""People desperate for care expect at least a fair review by the payer. This reeks of indifference to patients,"" Caplan said, adding the testimony shows there ""needs to be more transparency and accountability"" from private, for-profit insurers in making these decisions.

Murphy, the former American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology board member, said he was ""shocked"" and ""flabbergasted"" by the medical director's admission.

""This is something that all of us have long suspected, but to actually have an Aetna medical director admit he hasn't even looked at medical records, that's not good,"" said Murphy, who runs an allergy and immunology practice west of Philadelphia.

""If he has not looked at medical records or engaged the prescribing physician in a conversation -- and decisions were made without that input -- then yeah, you'd have to question every single case he reviewed.""

Murphy said when he and other doctors seek a much-needed treatment for a patient, they expect the medical director of an insurance company to have considered every possible factor when deciding on the best option for care.

""We run into the prior authorization issues when we are renewing therapy, when the patient's insurance changes or when an insurance company changes requirements,"" he said.

""Dealing with these denials is very time consuming. A great deal of nursing time is spent filling and refilling out paperwork trying to get the patient treatment.

908f65d6014d4451a62565d542681a25	['Lisa Drayer']	2018-08-30 00:00:00	What makes chocolate chip cookies so addictive?	https://www.cnn.com/	US	What makes chocolate chip cookies so addictive?	1	"(CNN) When I reflect on my childhood baking memories, one that stands out is a tray of warm chocolate chip cookies coming out of the oven. It was so tempting to eat the raw dough while making them -- talk about a lesson in delayed gratification -- but in 20 or so minutes, delicious buttery, sugary cookies dotted with chocolate chips would be ready to enjoy.

Never mind fancy desserts; chocolate chip cookies have always been one of my favorite treats. And if you are like me and find them irresistible, you probably can't stop after a few bites.

""Even today, after eating and living with them for 40 years, I still can't stop eating them,"" said Kathleen King, founder of Tate's Bake Shop in Southampton, New York, and creator of the top-rated chocolate chip cookie according to Consumer Reports. ""I am either eating no cookies, or I am eating several. I can't have one.""

But what exactly makes chocolate chip cookies so universally craved in the first place?

The emotional attachment to chocolate chip cookies

""I think a lot of it has to do with the connection to our past, whether it was a grandmother, a mother, a place visited, a summer home or family time. It's also usually the first cookie every child learned how to make, and so I think there's a tremendous emotional attachment and remembrance with the chocolate chip cookie,"" King said. ""Lifestyles are changing, but that connection is still hanging on.""

Eating chocolate chip cookies can be associated with a range of emotions. ""If I'm celebrating, I can have a couple of cookies, but if I'm sad, I want 10 cookies,"" she said. ""While the cookie is in your mouth, that moment is happiness -- and then it's gone, and you're sad again, and you have another one.""

The happiness that comes from sharing homemade chocolate chip cookies cannot be underestimated. King, who started baking chocolate chip cookies and selling them when she was 11 years old, said her biggest motivator for baking them was the joy they brought other people. ""That really made me happy -- and probably, a lot of people that bake will say the same thing: Sharing [chocolate chip cookies] makes people happy.""

Aside from the emotional comfort that chocolate chip cookies may provide, there may be scientific explanations for why we salivate for them. Some research suggests that ingredients in chocolate chip cookies may have additive properties. Take sugar: Evidence in humans shows that sugar and sweetness can induce rewards and cravings comparable in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs , including cocaine.

A traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe calls for ¾ cup of granulated sugar and ¾ cup of brown sugar, yielding 10 grams, or 2.5 teaspoons, of sugar per cookie.

Then there's the chocolate, which, in addition to sugar, contains small amounts of a compound known as anandamide. Interestingly, anandamide is also a brain chemical that targets the same cell receptors as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active ingredient in marijuana that is responsible for its mood-altering effects. That's not to say chocolate will produce the same ""high"" as marijuana, but there may be a chemical basis for the pleasure we get from eating chocolate.

According to Gary Wenk, director of neuroscience undergraduate programs at the Ohio State University and author of ""Your Brain on Food,"" high-fat, sugar-rich cookies will raise the level of anandamide in our brains independent of what's in the cookie, because it's our body's response to eating such a tasty item. ""The fat and sugar combine to induce our addiction as much as does the anandamide,"" Wenk said. ""It's a triple play of delight.""

Texture and flavor: Key to a cookie's addictive characteristics

All of this science may sound intriguing, but the simplest explanation for why chocolate chip cookies are so delectable may have to do with the mix of ingredients that combine in a way that appeals to our senses.

""A chocolate chip cookie is a brilliant contrast among the flavors and among the textures,"" said Gail Vance Civille, founder and president of Sensory Spectrum, a consulting firm that helps companies learn how sensory cues drive consumer perceptions of products.

The flavor of chocolate chip cookies, according to Civille, is ""a beautiful amalgam of caramelized butter and sugar,"" the result of the browning of butter and caramelizing of sugar while it bakes. The combination of the toasted grain with the browned butter, caramelized sugar, vanilla and chocolate are ""the beautiful rich flavors that blend together in a chocolate chip cookie,"" she said. And as the chocolate melts, it becomes more aromatic and punches up the flavor.

It sounds counterintuitive, but salt is important too, even in sweet treats. ""It is what adds interest to food, even if it's a sweet food, because it makes the sugar and other ingredients taste better and come together better,"" Civille said. ""A pinch of salt in cookies really makes a difference, and it enhances sweetness a little bit.""

King noted that ""with Tate's, we were the first to do the thin and crisp, which is kind of an addictive mouthfeel, and we were also the first to do a little bit heaver on the salt. People don't even put salt in cookies, but [without salt], it tastes flat.""

Other secrets to making delicious chocolate chip cookies include using butter instead of shortening or margarine; brown sugar, which has a molasses-like quality to it; and pure vanilla, according to King. A high-quality flour and a really good chocolate chip are also important.

The texture of chocolate chip cookies also plays a big role in their appeal. ""Just on the texture side, [the chocolate chip cookie] has a lot going for it,"" Civille said.

""Every bite will be interesting. ... You will hit the cookie, which has crispness due to air pockets in the cookie crumb, and then the chocolate, which is dense and uniform when you bite through it. It's like a symphony orchestra playing together. ... It's very harmonious,"" she said.

One of the simplest ways to test whether the flavor and texture of chocolate chip cookies are ""addictive enough"" is to observe people eating them.

""When I would create any product, if I put it out as a sample to my staff and if I didn't watch them unconsciously go back and take some more, then I felt it wasn't good enough. There's a lot of good, but I didn't want good. I wanted that addictive thing,"" King said.

Personal preferences

Although there are some universally appealing qualities of chocolate chip cookies that make them so addictive, specific preferences may vary from person to person. One may crave chocolate chip cookies that are soft and gooey; another may long for crispy, crunchy cookies.

Most people prefer semisweet chips, which have a soft melting quality that can lend itself to a more addictive mouthfeel with the crunchy caramelized cookie, according to King. But some may opt for milk chocolate, and others may like the taste of bittersweet chocolate in their cookies.

The optimal ratio of chocolate chips to cookie is also a personal preference. ""I'll put a bag on the table, and my husband will turn them over and look for the least amount of chips, but I'll look for the most,"" King said.

A happy indulgence

Whatever one's individual chocolate chip cookie preference -- or ""addiction"" -- it's fair to say that these beloved cookies can have a place in a balanced diet, as long as you are willing to keep portions in check.

""The main thing is not to think of food as good food and bad food. It's all good. It's how much you eat of it,"" King said. ""I used to be overweight, and I had that in my mind, if I ate a cookie, that was bad and now the day is ruined, instead of just, 'that's cool.' ""

So whether it feels like a true ""addiction"" or not, indulging in a chocolate chip cookie or two should be a happy experience."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120713123909-batch-of-chocolate-chip-cookies-super-tease.jpg
f7723218b0394b46a202f2821cb111f3	['Sandee Lamotte']	2018-02-01 00:00:00	What too much alcohol can do to your health	https://www.cnn.com/	US	What too much alcohol can do to your health	1	"(CNN) This feature is part of CNN Parallels , an interactive series exploring ways you can improve your health by making small changes to your daily habits.

A lot of us drink. Too many of us drink a lot.

Worldwide, each person 15 years and older consumes 13.5 grams of pure alcohol per day, according to the World Health Organization . Considering that nearly half of the world doesn't drink at all, that leaves the other half drinking up their share.

While the majority of the world drinks liquor, Americans prefer beer. The Beverage Marketing Corp . tracks these things: In 2017,Americans guzzled about 27 gallons of beer (or 216 pints), 2.6 gallons of wine and 2.2 gallons of spirits per drinking-age adult.

But Americans are lightweights in any worldwide drinking game, based on numbers from the World Health Organization . The Eastern European countries of Lithuania, Belarus, Czechia (the Czech Republic), Croatia and Bulgaria drink us under the table.

In fact, measuring liters drunk by anyone over 15, the US ranks 36th in the category of most sloshed nation; Austria comes in sixth; France is ninth (more wine) and Ireland 15th (yes, they drink more beer), while the UK ranks 18th.

Who drinks the least in the world? The Arab nations of the Middle East.

With all this boozing going on, just what damage does alcohol do to your health? Let's explore what science says are the downsides of having a tipple or two.

Counting calories

Even if you aren't watching your waistline, you might be shocked at the number of empty calories you can easily consume during happy hour.

Calories are typically defined by a "" standard "" drink. In the US, that's about 0.6 fluid ounces or 14 grams of pure alcohol, which differs depending on the type of adult beverage you consume.

For example, a standard drink of beer is one 12-ounce can (355 milliliters). For malt liquor, it's 8 to 9 fluid ounces (251 milliliters). A standard drink of red or white wine is about 5 fluid ounces (148 milliliters).

What's considered a standard drink continues to go down as the alcohol content goes up. But what if that changes? Let's use beer as an example.

It used to be that light beer came in around 100 calories while regular beer averaged 153 calories per 12-fluid ounce can or bottle -- that's the same as two or three Oreo cookies.

But beer calories depend on both alcohol content and carbohydrate level. So if you're a fan of today's popular craft beers, which often have extra carbs and higher alcohol content, you could easily face a calorie land mine in every can. Let's say you chose a highly ranked IPA, such as Sierra Nevada Bigfoot (9.6% alcohol) or Narwhal (10.2% alcohol), and you've downed a whopping 318 to 344 calories, about as much as a McDonald's cheeseburger. Did you drink just one?

If you pour correctly, white wine is about 120 calories per 5 fluid ounces, and red is 125. If you fill your glass to the brim, that might easily double.

Liquor? Gin, rum, vodka, tequila and whiskey cost you 97 calories per 1.5 fluid ounces, but that's without mixers. An average margarita will cost you 168 calories while a pina colada weighs in at a whopping 490 calories, about the same as a McDonald's Quarter Pounder.

2013 study in the US found that calorie intake went up on drinking days compared with non-drinking days, mostly due to alcohol: Men took in 433 extra calories, while women added 299 calories.

But alcohol can also affect our self-control, which can lead to overeating. A 1999 study found that people ate more when they had an aperitif before dinner than if they abstained.

Take heart. If you're a light to moderate drinker, meaning you stick to US guidelines of one ""standard"" drink a day for women and two for men, studies have shown that you aren't guaranteed to gain weight over time -- especially if you live an overall healthy lifestyle.

For example, a 2002 study of almost 25,000 Finnish men and women over five-year intervals found that moderate alcohol consumption, combined with a physically active lifestyle, no smoking and healthy food choices, ""maximizes the chances of having a normal weight.""

However, it appears that heavy drinking and binge drinking could be linked to obesity. And that's a problem. The numbers of binge drinkers -- defined as five or more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women within a couple of hours at least once a month -- has been rising in the United States.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says one in six adults binge about four times a month, downing about eight drinks in each binge.

In the UK, where binge drinking is defined as ""drinking lots of alcohol in a short space of time or drinking to get drunk,"" a 2016 national survey found 2.5 million people admitted to binge drinking in the last week.

Alcohol, of course, has no nutritional value and contains 7 calories per gram -- more than protein and even carbs, which both have 4 calories. Fat has 9 calories per gram.

All those empty alcohol calories have to end up somewhere.

Heart disease and cancer

The prevailing wisdom for years has been that drinking in moderation -- again, that's one ""standard"" drink a day for women and two for men -- is linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. But recent studies are casting some doubt on that long-held lore. Science now says it depends on your age and drinking habits.

2017 study of nearly 2 million Brits with no cardiovascular risk found that there was still a modest benefit in moderate drinking, especially for women over 55 who drank five drinks a week. Why that age? Alcohol can alter cholesterol and clotting in the blood in positive ways, experts say , and that's about the age when heart problems begin to occur.

For everyone else, the small protective effect on the heart was evident only if the drinks were spaced out during the week. Consuming heavily in one session, or binge drinking, has been linked to heart attacks -- or what the English call ""holiday heart.""

Also, a 2018 study found that drinking more than 100 grams of alcohol per week -- equal to roughly seven standard drinks in the United States or five to six glasses of wine in the UK -- increases your risk of death from all causes and in turn lowers your life expectancy. Links were found with different forms of cardiovascular disease, with people who drank more than 100 grams per week having a higher risk of stroke, heart failure, fatal hypertensive disease and fatal aortic aneurysm, where an artery or vein swells up and could burst.

In contrast, the 2018 study found that higher levels of alcohol were also linked to a lower risk of heart attack, or myocardial infarction.

Another 2018 study found that consistently drinking a moderate amount of alcohol, within recommended guidelines, had a protective effect on the heart over time. Unstable drinking habits were associated with a higher risk of heart disease, which the authors reflected might indicate broader lifestyle changes, such as poor health or stress. Former drinkers were also at greater risk.

Women who drink are at a higher risk for breast cancer ; alcohol contributes about 6% of the overall risk, possibly because it raises certain dangerous hormones in the blood. Drinking can also increase the chance you might develop bowel, liver, mouth and oral cancers

One potential reason: Alcohol weakens our immune systems , making us more susceptible to inflammation, a driving force behind cancer, as well as infections and the integrity of the microbiome in our digestive tract. That's true not only for chronic drinkers but for those who binge, as well.

Diabetes

The connection between alcohol and diabetes is complicated. Studies show that drinking moderately over three or four days a week may actually lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, drinking heavily increases the risk. Too much alcohol inflames the pancreas, which is responsible for secreting insulin to regulate your body's blood sugars.

If you have diabetes, alcohol may interact with various medications. If you take insulin or any pills that stimulate the release of insulin, alcohol can lead to hypoglycemia , a dangerously low blood sugar level, because alcohol stimulates the release of insulin as well. That's why experts recommend never drinking on an empty stomach. Instead, drink with a meal or at least some carbs.

And, of course, because alcohol is made by fermenting sugar and starch, it's full of empty calories, which contributes to obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Mood and memory

Because alcohol is a depressant, drinking can drown your mood. It may not seem that way while you ""party"" your inhibitions away, but that's just the drink depressing the part of the brain we use to control our actions. The more you drink, say experts , the more your negative emotions, such as anxiety, anger and depression, can take over.

Binge drinking is also associated with severe ""blackouts"" : the inability to remember what happened while drunk. Blackouts can range from small memory blips, such as forgetting a name, to more serious incidents, such as forgetting an entire evening.

Alcohol does this by decreasing the electrical activity of the neurons in your hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for the formation of short-term memories. Keep up that binge drinking, and you can permanently damage the hippocampus and develop sustained memory or cognitive problems.

How you look

Last but certainly not least, alcohol can have a significant effect on your good looks. First, it dehydrates you. That can leave your skin looking parched and wrinkled. It's also linked to rosacea, a skin condition causing redness, pimples and swelling on your face.

Do you know you can stink while you're drinking? During the time your liver is processing a single drink , which is on average an hour but varies for everyone, some of it leaves your body via your breath, urine and sweat.

Another reason drinking can affect your looks has to do with sleep . Although even a little bit of alcohol can help you fall asleep quickly, as the alcohol is metabolized and leaves the body you may suffer the ""rebound effect."" Instead of staying asleep, the body enters lighter sleep and wakefulness, which appears to get worse the more one drinks.

A lack of sleep leads to dark circles, puffy eyes and stress. Keep it up, studies say , and you're likely to see more signs of aging and a much lower satisfaction with your appearance.

0a6eddb2906446b9aa9f863926442c25	['Tia Miller']	2018-08-21 00:00:00	Rookie vegetarianism and the junk food trap	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Rookie vegetarianism and the junk food trap	1	"(CNN) A variety of inspirations may spark a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle change, the most common being animal welfare, environmental welfare and personal health. But even if health isn't the reason, it's important to maintain good health within any diet. Why not enjoy the benefits of being a vegetarian, even if you're doing it for the cows and the trees?

Mortality in vegetarians, according to a meta-study from 2012, was 9% lower than in nonvegetarians . And according to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, a vegetarian diet lowers risks of heart disease, cancer and diabetes

But simply being a vegetarian or vegan doesn't guarantee these results, because it's possible to abstain from meat or dairy and still live an unhealthy lifestyle. In fact, it can be quite common.

I was one of those unhealthy vegetarians who eliminated meat but replaced vegetables with all varieties of potatoes: French fries, chips, mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, sweet potatoes. My fruits were ""fruit snacks."" My meat became chemically processed veggie meat.

Within a year, I began to struggle with severe anemia, ADHD and fatigue. I would break my vegetarianism and eat a chicken breast, a burger or salmon to feel better. Meat would solve the problem, but it also made me bloated and constipated and gave me headaches.

My ""aha"" moment came when I was driving through Georgia one fall day and saw cows grazing in a field. I laughed because the animals I ate were all vegetarians. One of the reasons we are able to get quality nutrients from cows, chickens and turkeys is because their diet consists of grass, grains, corn and fruits. I realized what my diet was missing.

""Many vegetarians and vegans make the mistake of eliminating but not correctly replacing,"" said Dr. Brandi Jouett-Patrickson, an internal medicine doctor with Piedmont Physicians Group.

Here are the most important ways to ensure that your vegetarian lifestyle doesn't start as poorly as mine did.

Eat the rainbow

The US Department of Agriculture recommends filling half your plate with fruits and vegetables at each meal. This can be even more crucial for a vegetarian, given that meat often provides nutrients, particularly iron and vitamin B12.

""Each meal should have an array of fresh colors,"" Jouett-Patrickson said.

Eating green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, spinach and kale can help head off iron deficiency. Vegetarians can avoid B12 deficiency by eating dairy, but Jouett-Patrickson suggests that vegans use a B12 vitamin or fortified foods such as plant milks, soy products and some breakfast cereals.

Beware of processed food

Beginner vegetarians often eat a lot of processed foods, such as veggie meat, French fries, frozen pizza, instant oatmeal, instant ramen noodles, pastries. A recent study in the British Medical Journey suggests a link between highly processed foods and cancer

One way to get a sense of how processed a particular food is to read the ingredients. If you see numerous preservatives, colorants and unfamiliar words, be wary. The general rule should be the simpler, the better.

""The food you eat should be as local as possible,"" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. ""That cuts down on the travel time and the number of points where food can be contaminated. It also means your food doesn't need as many preservatives to increase shelf life."" Remember, fresh is always better.

More water

Dehydration is a lesser-known side effect in an unhealthy vegetarian lifestyle. When you eat a lot of processed food, you're reducing the hydration in your body.

Your body is roughly 60% water, which is vital to cells, organs and certain body functions. Make sure to drink plenty of water and other fluids.

Be intentional

This new lifestyle is not for the lazy; you must work hard to maintain the journey. Be intentional about your meal prep and choices. You may want to invest in cookbooks or even meal prep services to get off to the right start. Social media, particularly Instagram, can provide a wealth of tips and encouragement when transitioning.

Most of all, don't give up. Remember, it's a journey, and you're learning how to make vegetarianism work best for you. Follow these guidelines to avoid the unhealthy vegetarianism path, but even if you stumble, dust off yourself -- and your vegetables -- and try again."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180719094515-mcdonalds-french-fries-super-tease.jpg

McDonald's Big Mac has fewer calories and less sodium than some veggie burgers

(CNN) Plant-based diets have been associated with many health benefits, including a reduced risk of obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. So it might naturally follow that vegetarian fast food, which is inherently plant-based, would be more nutritionally appealing than its traditional relatives.

The truth is that, although the notion works in many cases, it's not a guiding food principle you can count on.

""Just because a restaurant or fast food menu item says it's vegetarian or vegan, it doesn't mean that it's automatically 'healthy.' It can have just as much, if not more, calories, saturated fat and sodium as non-vegetarian options,"" said Sharon Palmer, a registered dietitian and author of ""Plant-Powered for Life.""

It makes sense. After all, ingredients contribute calories, whether plant-based or not. And while fiber and protein can be higher in vegetarian meals, thanks to plentiful amounts of beans, vegetables and whole grains, so can things such as saturated fat and sodium, depending on how the food is prepared (fried vs. grilled, for example) and the amount of cheese and condiments a meal contains.

""Vegetarian and vegan food options that are deep-fried, covered in cheese or creamy sauces and piled over huge portions of fries, rice, wraps or breads may not be the healthiest option on the menu,"" Palmer said.

3afd27c3c3394e5bab8716bc038c1fef	['Susan Scutti']	2018-05-21 00:00:00	Eggs reduce heart disease risk, study says	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Eggs reduce heart disease risk, study says	1	"(CNN) Eating an egg a day may lower your risk of cardiovascular disease, a study of more than 400,000 adults in China suggests.

Daily egg eaters had an 18% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, which manifests as heart attacks and strokes, compared with adults who avoided eggs, according to the research published Monday in the journal Heart.

Commonly called heart disease, cardiovascular disease includes heart failure, arrhythmias and heart valve problems in addition to strokes and attacks. Raised blood pressure, carrying too much weight or obesity, and elevated blood sugar all contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is triggered by unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, smoking and harmful use of alcohol.

'Controversial' nutrition source

In the past, doctors sometimes warned patients to avoid eating too many eggs

Though eggs contain high-quality protein and other positive nutritional components, they also have high amounts of cholesterol, which was thought might be harmful, explained Canqing Yu , a co-author of the study and an associate professor in the Peking University School of Public Health in Beijing.

Yet ""existing studies on the association between egg and cardiovascular diseases are controversial due to small sample size and limited information,"" Yu wrote in an email. Past studies have provided only limited evidence from the Chinese population, ""which have huge differences in dietary habits, lifestyle behaviors and diseases patterns,"" Yu said.

These are among the reasons why he and his colleagues decided to investigate the relationship between eating eggs and cardiovascular disease.

To begin, they used information from an ongoing study of half a million adults living in 10 regions of China. They concentrated on 416,213 participants who'd never been diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes.

Slightly more than 13% of these adults, ranging in age from 30 to 79, said they ate about an egg a day while just over 9% reported never or very rarely enjoying an egg. Nearly all the participants ate chicken, not duck, eggs, Yu noted.

Over nearly nine years, the research team tracked this select group. They focused on major coronary events, such as heart attacks and strokes , including hemorrhagic strokes -- when a blood vessel bursts in the brain due, usually, to uncontrolled high blood pressure -- and ischemic strokes -- when a blood vessel feeding the brain becomes blocked, usually by a blood clot.

""Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths in China, which accounted for half of the total mortality,"" Yu said. ""Stroke, including hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, is the first cause of premature death, followed by ischemic heart disease.""

During follow-up, 9,985 people died of cardiovascular disease, and an additional 5,103 major coronary events occurred. Nearly 84,000 other participants were diagnosed with heart disease in this time period.

Analyzing the data, the researchers found that eating about an egg a day related to a lower risk of heart disease compared with not eating eggs.

In fact, participants who ate up to one egg daily had a 26% lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke, which is more common in China than in the United States or other high-income countries. Additionally, the egg eaters had a 28% lower risk of dying from this type of stroke.

Finally, egg eaters also enjoyed a 12% reduced risk of ischemic heart disease, which is diagnosed in those who show the early signs of gridlocked blood flow to the brain.

Based on the results, Yu said, eating eggs in moderation -- less than one a day -- is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases, especially hemorrhagic stroke. Even more, the new research is ""by far the most powerful project to detect such an effect,"" he said.

On the downside, the research team collected only ""crude information"" about egg consumption from participants, and this prevented them from estimating effects ""more precisely,"" Yu said. ""We should [also] be cautious when interpreting our results in a context of different dietary and lifestyle characteristics from China.""

Part of a healthy diet

Caroline Richard, an assistant professor of agricultural life and environmental sciences at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, said the new study is simply observational and so cannot show a direct cause and effect between eating eggs and risk of heart disease.

""Saying that, this is a very large study, and that in itself is a strength, and the researchers have done the best possible job to control for other factors,"" said Richard, who was not involved in the research.

Her own systematic review of studies showed that when participants are provided with between six and 12 eggs a week, no change occurs in major cardiovascular risk factors, including higher rates of blood sugar, inflammation and cholesterol.

""Several studies in our review observed a positive effect of egg consumption on HDL cholesterol,"" or ""good"" cholesterol, she added.

The new study, then, ""delivers a similar message"" that ""egg consumption does not increase the risk of developing a cardiovascular disease,"" Richard said.

Some studies have suggested that consuming eggs increases the risk of diabetes, she said.

""In this study however, they didn't assess the risk of developing diabetes, which may be because diabetes is a newer disease in the Chinese population and there is not good documentation of who has it,"" Richard said. Still, she noted, ""this will be very important data for helping develop dietary prevention guidelines in China.""

Cardiovascular disease, which takes the lives of 17.7 million people every year, is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization . Cardiovascular disease causes nearly a third -- 31% -- of all global deaths each year.

""Overall, I would say that consuming egg as part of a healthy diet does not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, and we now have another carefully done study to support that,"" Richard said."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140122153737-03-chicken-coop-super-tease.jpg
e87b353aa487422dbb72facf4646c127	['Susan Scutti']	2018-03-22 00:00:00	Cut your calories by 15% to stay young	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Cut your calories by 15% to stay young	1	"(CNN) Maybe there's no need for a fountain of youth after all. New research suggests that cutting calories by 15% for two years can slow the metabolic process that leads to aging and protect against age-related diseases.

After just one year on a reduced-calorie diet, study participants saw their metabolic rates drop significantly. The lowered rate continued into the second year and led to an overall decrease in oxidative stress, a process that has been tied to diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other age-related conditions.

""Reducing calorie intake provides health benefits to all people regardless of their current health status,"" said Leanne M. Redman, lead author of the study and an associate professor at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University.

Animal studies have shown that restricting calories by 25% can extend life. The new CALERIE (Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy) study was designed by Redman, her colleagues and the National Institute on Aging to answer a simple question: Would the same be true in humans?

Aging biomarkers

During the first phase, teams of researchers ran small-scale pilot experiments to answer a variety of questions including, what kind of calorie restriction could study participants actually stick to? To this end, some of the pilot studies tested a diet-only calorie reduction, others tested exercise only, and still others tested half-diet, half-exercise.

Another question posed by the researchers: What level of calorie restrictions would have an impact on biomarkers of aging?

Aging biomarkers are simple biological measurements that differentiate longer-lived people -- those who celebrate birthdays into their 90s and 100s -- from people who live the average life expectancy, Redman said.

""We know that longer-lived individuals are able to sustain lower blood sugar levels and lower levels of insulin and have lower core body temperature levels in comparison to people who don't live as long as them,"" she said.

After the pilot studies, the National Institute on Aging committed to funding larger phase two CALERIE studies at three universities: Pennington in Baton Rouge, Washington University in St. Louis and Tufts University in Boston.

At Pennington, Redman and her colleagues focused on reducing calories by 25% through diet alone. Women between 25 and 45 and men between 25 and 50 were recruited; about half were normal weight and the other half overweight but not obese. Throughout the study, participants ate what they liked, yet they also took vitamins and supplements to ensure that their diets were ""nutritionally adequate,"" Redman said.

Each participant was also given a scale. Instead of calculating daily calories and slashing them by 25%, weight loss was used to estimate the total reduction in calories for each participant over time.

However, the participants did not hit the 25% reduction as anticipated, Redman said: ""People achieved 15% calorie restriction, actual, over the two years."" No matter. The results from this lesser calorie restriction amount were ""pretty remarkable,"" she said.

For example, participants lost an average of about 20 pounds each by the end of the first year and maintained that loss during the second year.

""The calorie-restrictive diet also caused a reduction in sleeping metabolic rate by about 10%,"" Redman said. This remained true after one year, when weight loss peaked, and after two years, when weight remained constant.

A slowed metabolism means the body has become more efficient in using fuel -- whether from food or oxygen -- to derive energy.

""It's important because every time we generate energy in the body, we generate byproducts,"" Redman said. These byproducts of normal metabolism, also called oxygen radicals, accumulate in the body and over time cause damage to cells and organs, she explained. And this damage is ""what has been linked to a shortened lifespan,"" she said.

Not only did calorie restriction slow the metabolism of participants, lower levels of oxidative damage were seen when measured by a compound in urine. Calorie restriction, then, mimicked some of the healthy aging signposts seen in long-lived individuals, Redman said.

'Breakthrough'

The ""big breakthrough"" with this study, said biologist John R. Speakman of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, is that it is the first randomized controlled trial of calorie restriction in humans.

Randomized, controlled trials, in which participants are divided by chance into groups to compare interventions, are considered more valuable to scientists than other types of experiments. Speakman, who did not participate in the research but he served on the data safety and monitoring board for the CALERIE project, explained that all previous studies of calorie restriction in humans have been on a voluntary basis.

""It has been known since the 1930s that calorie restriction reduces the rate of aging and extends lifespan in rodents,"" Speakman said. Since then, studies in different animals show the same general pattern -- with some exceptions. ""For example, it doesn't work in houseflies,"" he said. ""Plus, the monkey literature is a bit confusing.""

For this reason, the new study's ""big contribution"" is that participants showed two key changes previously observed in calorie-restricted rodents: lowered metabolic rate and reduced production of radical oxygen species, Speakman said.

That said, the level of calorie restriction achieved in the new study was ""rather modest compared to that used in rodents and other animals,"" he said. ""This really shows the difficulties in doing calorie restriction work on humans."" However, a strength of the new research is that it ""included extensive measurements of the individual responses.""

Exactly how calorie restriction prevents aging, Speakman said ""is the million-dollar question."" The research supports two theories of longer life: the ""rate of living"" (lower metabolism) and reduced oxidative damage.

However, the study shows a correlation only, he said, ""so we can't infer that these changes are causally linked to reduced aging. Nevertheless it is a step forwards to indicate that these two ideas are not rejected by the current research.""

Going forward, Redman wants to reconvene the study participants to see whether they're maintaining calorie restrictions and lowered metabolic rates. She also wants to study a group of people from early in their lives until death so she can see the possible long-term results of restricted calorie intake.

It's not only the diet, she repeated.

It's true that the people who see more sunrises than most of us eat less -- and more healthy -- calories than in a Western diet, Redman said.

More than 70% of sodium in an average American diet comes in packaged, prepared and restaurant foods

This is part two of a two-part feature. Part 1: Curbing salt intake could add years to your life

(CNN) We've covered the many health reasons to curb your salt intake. But let's talk about how, especially when it's hidden in many of the foods we love.

When cutting back on sodium, it's important to start slowly, as going cold turkey can shock your taste buds. ""If you try to make chicken soup with no salt, you will notice the difference,"" said Sonya Angelone, a registered dietitian who specializes in cardiovascular nutrition and is the media spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Instead, start with half of the amount of salt you would typically use.

You can also look for low- or reduced-sodium versions of your favorite foods, or make your own versions, like homemade spaghetti sauce. For example, canned tomato sauce can have 1,000 milligrams of sodium per serving. ""But canned tomatoes have about 300 milligrams, and tomato paste has very little sodium -- so you can just add water or low-sodium chicken broth"" to make a sauce, Angelone said.

Using herbs and spices can help bring out flavor in foods without salt. Spice blends without salt can come in handy during cooking. You might use a Mexican blend with cumin, chili pepper and smoked paprika for chili, while blends containing rosemary, thyme and oregano might be well suited for Italian dishes, Angelone explained.

When dining out, ask for steamed vegetables and fish, and skip the sauces. And when food shopping, compare the sodium values of similar foods. ""Some rolls can have 400 milligrams; other ones can have 200,"" Angelone said. Breads and rolls are top sources of sodium in the US diet, according to the American Heart Association , along with cold cuts and cured meats, pizza, soup, sandwiches and poultry.

57c20d42f17b495c93daedc967283887	['Lisa Drayer']	2017-06-09 00:00:00	One-month sugar detox: A nutritionist explains how and why	https://www.cnn.com/	US	One-month sugar detox: A nutritionist explains how and why	1	"(CNN) If you've read about the latest wellness trends, you may have entertained the idea of a diet detox.

But whether you've considered juicing, fasting or cleansing in an effort to lose weight or improve your well-being, you're probably aware that drastically cutting out foods is not effective as a long-term lifestyle approach to healthy eating.

In fact, strict detoxing can cause issues including fatigue, dizziness and low blood sugar.

But there is one kind of sustainable detox that is worthwhile, according to some experts. Reducing sugar in your diet can help you drop pounds, improve your health and even give you more radiant skin.

""Sugar makes you fat, ugly and old,"" said Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and co-author of ""The Sugar Detox: Lose the Sugar, Lose the Weight -- Look and Feel Great."" ""What we've discovered in the last couple of years is that sugar is keeping us overweight. It's also a leading cause of heart disease; it negatively affects skin, and it leads to premature aging.""

Sugar addiction

Here's more bad news: We can't stop consuming sugar. ""People have a real dependency -- a real addiction to sugar,"" Alpert said. ""We have sugar, we feel good from it, we get (the feeling of) an upper, and then we crash and need to reach for more.""

About 10% of the US population are true sugar addicts, according to Robert Lustig, professor of pediatrics and member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. What's more, research suggests that sugar induces rewards and cravings that are similar in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs.

One of the biggest concerns is the amount of added sugars in our diets, which are often hidden in foods. Although ice cream cake is an obvious source of sugar, other foods that may not even taste sweet -- such as salad dressings, tomato sauces and breads -- can be loaded with the white stuff.

""People don't realize that seemingly healthy foods are loaded with sugar -- and so we're basically eating sugar all day long, from morning till night,"" Alpert said.

How to sugar detox: Going cold turkey for three days

The good news is that even if you're not a true sugar ""addict,"" by eliminating sugar from your diet, you can quickly lose unwanted pounds, feel better and have a more radiant appearance.

""There is no one person who wouldn't benefit by eliminating added sugars from their diets,"" Lustig said.

Children can benefit, too. Lustig's research revealed that when obese children eliminated added sugars from their diets for just nine days, every aspect of their metabolic health improved -- despite no changes in body weight or total calories consumed.

But going cold turkey is what works best, at least in the beginning.

""Early on in my practice, when I would notice that people had real addiction to sugar, we'd start trying to wean them of sugar or limit their intake or eat in moderation ... but the word 'moderation' is so clichéd and not effective,"" Alpert said. ""It was just ineffective to ask people to eat less of something when they're struggling with this bad habit. You wouldn't ask an alcoholic to just drink two beers.

""What was so successful in getting my clients to kick their sugar habit was to go cold turkey. When they would go cold turkey, I wasn't their favorite person -- but the number one positive effect was that it recalibrated their palate,"" she said. ""They could now taste natural sugars in fruits, vegetables and dairy that they used to be so dulled to.""

So for the first three days on a sugar detox, Alpert recommends no added sugars -- but also no fruits, no starchy vegetables (such as corn, peas, sweet potatoes and butternut squash), no dairy, no grains and no alcohol. ""You're basically eating protein, vegetables and healthy fats.""

For example, breakfast can include three eggs, any style; lunch can include up to 6 ounces of poultry, fish or tofu and a green salad, and dinner is basically a larger version of lunch, though steamed vegetables such as broccoli, kale and spinach can be eaten in place of salad. Snacks include an ounce of nuts and sliced peppers with hummus. Beverages include water, unsweetened tea and black coffee.

Though they don't contribute calories, artificial sweeteners are not allowed on the plan, either. ""These little pretty colored packets pack such a punch of sweetness, and that's how our palates get dulled and immune and less reactive to what sweetness really is,"" Alpert said.

Consuming artificial sweeteners causes ""you not only (to) store more fat,"" Lustig explained, ""you also end up overeating later on to compensate for the increased energy storage.""

How to sugar detox: When an apple tastes like candy

Once the first three days of the sugar detox are completed, you can add an apple.

""By the fourth day, an apple tastes like candy,"" Alpert said. ""The onions are sweet! Almonds are sweet! Once you take sugar away from your diet cold turkey, your palate recalibrates, and you start tasting natural sugars again.""

Starting with day four, you can add one apple and one dairy food each day. Dairy, such as yogurt or cheese, should be full-fat and unsweetened. ""Fat, fiber and protein slow the absorption of sugar, so taking out fat from dairy will make you absorb sugar faster,"" Alpert said.

You can also add some higher-sugar vegetables such as carrots and snow peas, as well as a daily serving of high-fiber crackers. Three glasses of red wine in that first week can be added, too.

During week two, you can add a serving of antioxidant-rich berries and an extra serving of dairy. You can also add back starchy vegetables such as yams and winter squash.

For week three, you can add grains such as barley, quinoa and oatmeal, and even some more fruit including grapes and clementines. You can also have another glass of red wine during the week and an ounce of dark chocolate each day.

""Week three should be quite livable,"" Alpert said.

Week four is the home stretch, when you can enjoy two starches per day, including bread and rice, in addition to high-fiber crackers. Wine goes up to five glasses per week.

""You can have a sandwich in week four, which just makes things easier,"" Alpert said. ""I want people living. Week four is the way to do it.""

Week four defines the maintenance part of the plan -- though intentional indulgences are allowed, such as ice cream or a piece of cake at a birthday party. ""Because the addictive behavior is gone, having ice cream once or twice will not send you back to square one,"" Alpert said. Additionally, no fruit is off-limits once you've completed the 31 days.

""The whole purpose is to give people control and ownership and a place for these foods in our life,"" Alpert said.



Benefits and cautions with slashing sugar

Detoxing from sugar can help you lose weight quickly. ""We had over 80 testers from all over the country, and they lost anywhere between 5 to 20 pounds during the 31 days, depending on their weight or sugar addiction,"" Alpert said. ""Many also noticed that a lot of the weight was lost from their midsection. Belts got looser!""

Participants also reported brighter eyes, clearer skin and fewer dark circles. They also had more energy and fewer mood swings.

""I have lost approximately 40 pounds following the sugar detox,"" said Diane, who preferred not to share her last name. She has been on the plan for approximately two years.

""I thought I was educated on weight loss, but like many, I was miseducated, and by reducing fat, I was really just adding sugar. With the elimination of sugar, including artificial sweeteners, it is incredible how sweet foods tastes.""

Diane added back some healthy fats into her diet, which keeps her feeling satisfied. And her sugar cravings disappeared. ""This is probably the longest I have remained on a plan, and I don't feel like this will change. It just feels natural and normal.""

There are challenges and medical considerations before starting, though. Since the first few days of a sugar detox can be challenging, it's important to pick three days during which your schedule will be supportive.

""Depending on how intense your addiction is, you can experience withdrawal symptoms, such as brain fog, crankiness and fatigue,"" Alpert said. Lustig found that the children in his study experienced anxiety and irritability during the first five days of eliminating sugar and caffeine, though it eventually subsided.

""If you feel bad, stop and have a piece of fruit. But if you can push through and stay well-hydrated, you can really break your cycle of sugar addiction,"" Alpert said.

It's important to note that the plan may not be appropriate for diabetics, extreme athletes or anyone taking medication to control blood sugar. It is also not recommended for pregnant women.

Finally, before starting a sugar detox, enlist the help of friends and/or family members for support. ""You need people around you to help you be successful,"" Lustig said. ""The whole family has to do it together."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160520102514-sugar-super-tease.jpg
f8f6633038a84587a24ffcb46b0b6200	['Sandee Lamotte']	2017-06-30 00:00:00	Military diet: 3-day diet or dud?	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Military diet: 3-day diet or dud?	1	"(CNN) Looking for an easy diet to lose a quick few pounds? If you're searching on the Internet, chances are you've stumbled on something called the ""military diet.""

It's also known as the Navy diet, the Army diet and sometimes the ice cream diet, because in addition to hot dogs and tuna fish, you get to eat ice cream on all three days of the program.

Smells fishy, right? Well, hold your nose. It's about to get really stinky.

What is the military diet?

The military diet is a variation of the ever-popular three-day diet, a crash plan of ""fill-in-the-blank"" foods to eat if you want to lose weight fast. These diets typically claim that you can lose about 10 pounds in three days to a week if you follow their blueprint to the letter. The meal plans are usually extremely basic and calorie-restrictive, because let's face it, that's how you lose weight.

But are these diets healthy? Will the weight stay off?

""With this type of low-calorie, lower-carbohydrate diet, you are losing mostly water and potentially some muscle,"" said registered dietitian Elaine Magee , author of ""Tell Me What to Eat If I Have Diabetes."" ""Water weight drops quickly as the body's glycogen stores decline, which happens when you restrict carbs and calories. Weight will come back when you begin to eat normally again.""

Could it be that the military diet is different? Here's a breakdown of what's prescribed on days one to three of the military diet, with calories calculated via the US Department of Agriculture's calorie-calculating tool, Supertracker.

Breakfast is a cup of caffeinated coffee or tea, one slice of toast with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and half a grapefruit. That's 308 calories.

Lunch is another cup of coffee or tea, a bare-bones slice of toast (whole-wheat is best, they rightly say) and a half-cup of tuna. This meal is tiny, only 139 calories.

Dinner is 3 ounces of any meat (that's about the size of a playing card), a cup of green beans, half of a banana and a small apple (not a large apple, even though the calorie difference is minuscule), but wait: You get a whole cup of vanilla ice cream! If you choose steak instead of a lean chicken breast as your entree, this meal equals 619 calories.

But even with the steak and the cup of full-fat ice cream, the day adds up to a mere 1,066 calories. No snacks allowed.

""If you're used to eating 2,000 to 2,500 calories a day, such a drastic drop will be hard to do,"" said registered dietitian Lisa Drayer , who writes about nutrition for CNN. ""You're going to be tired and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. It will be hard to exercise, and I would think you'll be quite hungry as well.""

Here's day two's repast. It adds up to only 1,193 calories, even if you pick some higher-fat options.

Breakfast is another dry piece of toast, one egg cooked however you like and half of a banana. Let's say you fry your egg in oil. That's 223 calories.

Lunch is a hard-boiled egg, five saltine crackers and a cup of cottage cheese. If you choose full-fat cottage cheese, the total is 340 calories.

Dinner is half of a banana, a half-cup of carrots, a full cup of broccoli, two hot dogs (that's right!) and another treat: a half-cup of vanilla ice cream. The meal totals 630 calories (if you eat a full-fat pork or beef dog).

How does this fare fair?

""I never recommend hot dogs or any processed meats,"" Drayer said, ""because they are associated with a higher risk for cancer .""

""Ice cream is not a good use of the meager calories,"" she added. ""You could have 3 cups of salad and only eat 100 calories, or other nutritious foods that will be satisfying and hold back the hunger.""

Day three is the most restrictive, only 762 calories.

Breakfast is a slice of cheddar cheese with five saltines and a small apple. That's 232 calories.

Lunch is grim: one dry slice of toast and an egg. Even if you fry the egg in oil again, that's a total of 170 calories.

Dinner is 460 calories and a stomach-turning combination of half a banana, a full cup of tuna and another cup of ice cream. Maybe they think that by now, you're so hungry, you'll be willing to eat those foods together.

The websites promoting the military diet say that eating certain food combinations will boost your metabolism.

""There is no truth behind claims that the food combinations in the first few days will increase your metabolism and burn fat,"" Magee said.

""There's no research I know of behind those claims,"" Drayer agreed.

And what about the rest of the week?

You round out your week by eating what you like, so long as it's less than 1,500 calories a day. Then you can start on the three-day restrictions again.

Best of all, no exercise -- zero, zip, nada -- is said to be needed on this diet.

""Yet another fad diet that won't lead to healthy or sustainable weight loss!"" Magee said with passion, adding that exercise is ""key to lasting weight loss.""

She also feels there are potential physical and emotional ramifications to diets that restrict and deprive you to this extent.

""It can lead to weight cycling, a quick loss and regain of weight, that can weaken your immune system, mess with your metabolic rate and increase the risk of other health problems, such as gallstones and heart trouble,"" Magee said.

Why is it called the military diet?

articles, bloggers, Why would such a fad diet be associated with the military? According to various YouTubers and message board posts , it was designed by nutritionists in the US military to drop pounds off recruits who otherwise wouldn't measure up.

""What? In my 30 years working with the military, I've never heard of it,"" said certified nutrition specialist Patricia Deuster , professor at the Uniformed Services University and author of the first US Navy SEAL Nutrition guide.

""We did not develop this. We do not use it. It has absolutely no resemblance to the real military diet. Even our rations are healthier and more nutritionally sound,"" Deuster said. ""It looks like they just took the name 'military' and added it to the diet and capitalized on it.""

""The Birmingham Hospital Diet did not originate with the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and we do not support or recommend it,"" university public relations manager Bob Shepard said. ""This diet has absolutely no connection to UAB Hospital other than the often repeated but false Internet rumors.""

Oh?

""It is unfortunate our name has been associated with this diet,"" the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement. ""We have never endorsed this meal plan, and it does not meet the standards for what we would consider a healthy diet for heart health or overall well-being.""

And?

""The American Heart Association is not -- and never has been -- associated with this diet.""

""This didn't come from us, despite the use of the word Kaiser. Kaiser Permanente supports a balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.""

""None of these diets, including the three-day diet, was developed at or ever associated with Mayo Clinic,"" said Dr. Donald Hensrud, director of the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program and medical editor of the real Mayo Clinic Diet. ""It is likely the originators tried to capitalize on Mayo Clinic's brand recognition as a way of promoting these diets.""

Where did this diet come from?

If you search the Internet for the military diet, you'll probably end up on the top result: themilitarydiet.com . There, you'll find the detailed diet, with pictures and tips on how to make it work for you. There are substitutions, frequently asked questions, a blog, a calorie count, a link to like them on Facebook and a review that fights back against nutritionists who debunk the diet.

Oh, and there are lots of ads.

But nowhere on the page is there an author, an expert, a nutritional guru. No one takes ownership of this information or gives you any credentials to prove their expertise.

""That's a red flag,"" Drayer said. ""Any helpful diet plan should be created or supported by a credible person or resource or organization. If something is out there without any author or inventor, anyone can say anything and not know how the body works.""

Trying to track down the owners of three of the most popular military diet sites proved to be a dead end. Emails and calls to listed numbers got no responses.

How diet misinformation spreads

""Due to our democratic process, we have a wide-open information environment in the US,"" said Brian Southwell, editor of a new book on fake news called "" Misinformation and Mass Audiences ."" ""There's no careful censoring of false information.""

Add to that the fact that science still doesn't have the ""perfect"" solution for weight loss and maintenance, he said, and you've got an area that is ripe for exploitation.

""These dieting sites have a catchy name, the promise of lineage to established institutions, and that is what tends to spread across the Internet, instead of a peer-reviewed study,"" said Southwell, who directs the Science in the Public Sphere program at the nonprofit research group RTI Internationa l. ""And just like direct mail, if you get 5% of people to click through, you can make a huge profit. It doesn't cost much to unleash stuff online.""

Drayer agreed. ""I think a lot of people just want to know the next dieting magic bullet, quick fix, and they just go for these fad things.""

But why are so many of us fooled in the first place?

The failure of some people's ""BS detectors"" when they encounter fake information can be explained, Southwell said, by what science now knows about how the brain processes data. Instead of sorting the good from bad as the information arrives, the brain accepts it all, ""and then in another part of the brain, it's tagged as true or false.""

""It leaves open this window of opportunity,"" he explained, ""so people believe just long enough and then get tired, distracted, and what happens? They get sucked in. They might be skeptical at first but fail to do the research and think, 'well, maybe this will work. This might be my solution.' ""

The fact that so many of us share our discoveries with friends and loved ones on social accounts fuels the misinformation fire. Southwell calls it ""social contagion.""

""It's like the dynamics of infectious disease. You've spread the disease before you've even come down with it, "" he explained. ""You find it, you share, you read more and find out that it's not effective, or you try it out and you're disappointed. But the genie is out of the bottle already.""

According to Southwell, that's exactly what many of these sites are counting on.

""It doesn't matter if it ultimately gets debunked, because it's going to take a while for it to reach the same numbers of people as the original rumor or fake diet,"" he explained. ""And the debunking is not as sexy as the original diet lure.

""In the meantime, you might see the spread of unhealthy dieting behavior, and for some people with certain diseases or conditions, that can cause real harm,"" Southwell said, such as heart disease or diabetes. ""But it can't be traced back. Who is culpable for that?""

Healthy ways to lose fast?

Let's face it. We still want a quick way to lose 5 or 10 pounds fast, just in time for that special occasion. Is it possible to do so in a healthy way?

""I will prescribe a modified three-day diet just to jump-start weight loss,"" Drayer said. ""I typically recommend increasing your water intake and eliminating all starchy carbs like breads, pasta, cereal and rice, as well as sweets and treats for one week. Doing this not only cuts calories, but you also shed some extra water too, which can be motivating as the numbers on the scale go down.""

For those who drink their calories, Drayer recommends slashing sugary beverages such as sodas, flavored lattes, fruit juices and smoothies, ""as the calories from these beverages can really add up.""

Magee prefers to trick the body into losing weight, to avoid what she calls a starvation backlash.

""When you decrease your calories so severely as they do in the three-day military diet, your body tends to go into conservation mode and actually burns fewer calories,"" she said, ""because it thinks you are entering a potato famine or similar, and it wants to survive.

""I think it's better to trick your body into burning calories by decreasing the calories you eat a little, increasing exercise to burn more calories, to create a daily deficit of about 250 calories a day,"" she explains. ""It's slower but more sustained weight loss, and you are more likely to lose body fat rather than muscle tissue and water.""

Regardless of what method you try, said Drayer, remember that any diet should be cleared by your nutritionist or doctor before you begin. And when it comes to the three-day military diet, she concluded: ""I can't imagine any doctor or expert endorsing the military diet as healthy or beneficial in any way."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170526163032-mre-card-image-super-tease.jpg
0d9793ba9e7442f8a431bf4f567471fd	['Lisa Drayer']	2018-03-23 00:00:00	How to succeed at intermittent fasting	https://www.cnn.com/	US	How to succeed at intermittent fasting	1	"(CNN) ""Intermittent fasting,"" a dieting approach that involves cycling between periods of eating and abstaining from food, has been trending in diet circles. This is in part because reports claim that celebrities such as Beyonce, Hugh Jackman, Ben Affleck and Nicole Kidman are doing it but also because increasingly more research reveals that the eating pattern may promote weight loss and improve overall health.

The method is not appropriate for everyone, however, particularly pregnant women and those with medical conditions such as diabetes or eating disorders. And though studies are promising, it remains to be seen if this type of eating can become a sustainable lifestyle habit instead of a drop-a-dress-size-in-a-week fad.

""The jury is still out, especially on how healthy, sustainable and realistic this approach is,"" said Samantha Heller, a registered dietitian and senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health in New York. ""Eating very low calories, or none, on alternate days feels punitive to many and may exacerbate an already difficult and complex relationship someone has with food.""

If you are still hoping to give intermittent fasting a try, there are some things to consider that can increase your chances of reaching your goals. Also, be sure to check with your doctor before starting a fasting regimen.

Pick the level of fasting you can handle

The appeal of intermittent fasting may be related to its simplicity, as it seems to require less effort than restricting calories every day. But there are different approaches to the eating pattern that vary in intensity.

One regimen known as time-restricted feeding advises consuming all of your calories within a range of three to 12 hours a day, whereas an approach known as the ""5:2"" diet advises eating 500 to 600 calories for two days of the week and eating whatever you want on the other five days. A third, much more stringent type of regimen involves alternating 24-hour fasting periods (in which no foods or calorie-containing beverages are consumed) with non-fasting days, during which anything can be eaten in any amount.

Though time-restricted feeding might not seem that different from a typical eating day, especially if you tend to skip breakfast, alternate-day fasting may cause intense hunger on fasting days and can be much more challenging to sustain.

""People who are accustomed to eating regularly scheduled meals or suffer from 'head hunger' may find alternate-day fasting extremely difficult,"" said Kristen Smith, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Head hunger is the desire to eat when you are not physically hungry but are triggered to eat by emotions and social factors.

For the greatest success, Smith recommends choosing a fasting regimen that best suits your lifestyle, your health history and your ability to sustain fasting. For example, alternate-day fasting may not be appropriate for someone with an active job that requires manual labor or a job that centers around food, such as a chef.

Focus on protein and fiber-rich foods on semi-fasting days

Protein and fiber-rich foods will keep you feeling full and satisfied, which is important when calories are strictly limited. Healthy fats such as nuts and peanut butter can also curb hunger but provide a lot of calories for a small portion size.

If you are limiting your calories to about 500 to 600 per day, you might focus on one or two mini meals and snacks. Smith recommends a small piece of grilled salmon with half a cup of steamed veggies, grilled chicken over spaghetti squash, an egg-white omelet with veggies or black beans with a cup of veggies. For snacks, she favors fat-free plain Greek yogurt, two cups of plain popcorn, a cup of raw veggie sticks or a medium piece of fruit.

High-volume foods such as soups may also help on semi-fasting days, as they can fill you up on fewer calories than solid foods. Additionally, meal replacement bars may provide a convenient option, especially if you don't feel like preparing food on fasting days.

Don't gorge on non-fasting days

Our bodies want to keep us alive. If we are consuming very few calories on certain days, when we do eat, our bodies are going to do everything they can to encourage us to eat a lot because they don't know when the next meal will be available, Heller explained. ""We also feel that as a reward for sticking to 500 calories or less, we are allowed and 'deserve' to eat large portions of whatever we want,"" she said.

That kind of reward can bring unintended consequences. ""Overdoing it on a non-fasting day and eating excessive calories may actually lead to consuming an amount of calories you would consume in two days and defeat the purpose of a fasting day,"" Smith said.

In other words, having pancakes with bacon for breakfast, a fried chicken sandwich for lunch and a cheeseburger with fries for dinner on a non-fasting day can stall weight loss and prevent you from reaching your goals.

Don't go overboard with exercise on fasting days

Strenuous exercise, such as cycling, running, high-impact aerobics and weight lifting, is not advised on fasting days because the body does not have the fuel available to sustain rigorous activity, Heller explained.

If you want to do some form of physical activity on those days, Smith recommends sticking with walking, stretching or gentle yoga.

Drink enough water

If you decide to avoid food for any length of time, adequate hydration is important and should be maintained. ""On a fasting day, someone may be more likely to become dehydrated because they aren't eating regularly scheduled meals, which is a common time people hydrate,"" Smith said.

Foods such as fruits, vegetables and broth-based soups contain significant amounts of water and can help you stay hydrated. Those fasting should be cautious with caffeine-containing beverages, as they may contribute to dehydration, Smith said.

Know when to stop

If you experience lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches,difficulty concentrating or any other symptoms that regularly interfere with your daily functioning, you should stop fasting.

dd9f9441205048d894483dd9584b0de9	['Tara Leong', 'The Conversation']	2018-03-12 00:00:00	Eat healthier without quitting sugar	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Eat healthier without quitting sugar	1	"Not long ago, fat was the evil dietary villain. Before that it was salt. Now the sugar-free diet has exploded onto the health and wellness scene -- and seems to have topped many people's list of New Year's resolutions.

Sugar-free diets encourage people to avoid table sugar (sucrose), sweeteners such as honey and maple syrup, refined flours, condiments, soft drinks, sweets and some fruits such as bananas. Some also recommend eliminating or restricting dairy products.

The diet's advocates rightly note that excessive sugar consumption may lead to obesity and therefore increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.

And it's true we are swallowing too much of the sweet stuff, with the average American consuming around 20 teaspoons of added sugar a day.

But you don't need to quit sugar to lift your game on healthy eating. Quitting sugar is unlikely to improve your health any more than cutting down on ultra-processed foods, eating more vegetables, cooking food from scratch and limiting how much extra sugar you eat and drink.

At best, the sugar-free diet is confusing and imposes an arbitrary set of rules that aren't based on scientific evidence. At worst, such a restrictive diet can create food fear or an unhealthy relationship with food.

Diet mentality

The sugar-free diet is restrictive, with lists of ""allowed"" foods (such as whole grains, blueberries and grapefruits) and ""not allowed"" foods (such as white bread, bananas and raisins). This inadvertently promotes a diet mentality and causes followers to worry about accidentally eating something that's not allowed.

People who worry about food are more likely to diet. This may be because they are worried specifically about their weight, or about the impact certain nutrients have on their health.

Research shows dieting is not effective over the long term and can lead to greater weight gain over time. The brain interprets dieting and restriction as a famine , which causes the storage of fat for future shortages.

Dieting is stressful. In response to this, our body releases stress hormones such as cortisol , which may cause the body to store fat, particularly in the abdominal area.

Worrying about food can lead to stress , anxiety and depression, and is one of the defining features of the condition known as orthorexia

Orthorexia is the overwhelming preoccupation with eating healthily. People with orthorexia spend a lot of time thinking and worrying about food and eliminating foods that are deemed impure or unhealthy. Some experts suggest this behaviour is a precursor to, or a form of, an eating disorder.

Estimates suggest anywhere between 7% and 58% of the population may have the condition. There are no clear diagnostic criteria, which makes it difficult to measure its prevalence.

But we know 15% of women will experience an eating disorder at some stage in their life. So we need to ensure nutrition advice, however well-intentioned, doesn't promote or encourage disordered eating.

Cutting out the good stuff

Some sugar-free diets advise people to cut out or restrict healthy foods and food groups such as fruit and dairy, without evidence to support their exclusion. This perpetuates the food fear/dietary restriction cycle and may contribute to nutrient deficiencies.

These diets also recommend people avoid fruit for a period of time , and then re-introduce a limited list of expensive ""healthy"" fruits (such as berries) while avoiding the cheaper ""unhealthy"" fruits such as bananas.

Whole fruit is a wonderful source of fibre, essential vitamins and minerals, as well as antioxidants. Two serves of fruit per day can reduce the risk of developing some cancers, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Given American adults only consume half their daily requirements for fruit, the advice to restrict fruit further could result in people missing out on these benefits.

Many sugar-free followers also avoid plain dairy products such as milk, yoghurt and cheese, due to the assumption these contain sugars.

The sugar in plain dairy products is the natural lactose (a carbohydrate), which is nothing to fear. Unnecessarily avoiding dairy may increase the risk of osteoporosis if not replaced with adequate levels of calcium from other sources.

Sugar replacements

Strangely, many of the sugar-free recipes use expensive sugar alternatives -- such as rice malt syrup (due to its low fructose content), maple syrup (which is sometimes allowed and sometimes not) and dates -- to replace sugar.

However, these are still sugars and contain the same number of calories per gram as any other sugar. These alternatives offer no additional nutritional benefits other than rice malt syrup, which is a useful option only for those with a fructose malabsorption issue, and dates, which contain fibre.

People often eat more of the food containing these alternatives under the guise of it being sugar-free , which could lead to unintentional weight gain. One study found people ate about 35% more of a snack when it was perceived as healthy than when it was seen as unhealthy.

What to do instead

Eat plenty of plants, enjoy whole grains, beans and legumes. Fruit is your friend -- not your enemy.

Most people could probably eat a little less sugar, a little less often, but you don't have to quit it for good to be healthy.

0d4ef5ab4d7c4fe099e56e7267002dcc	['Sandee Lamotte']	2018-02-26 00:00:00	10 best foods for your heart	https://www.cnn.com/	US	10 best foods for your heart	1	"(CNN) Keeping your heart healthy is about more than avoiding fast food and overly processed chow. You can also pump up your heart's health by choosing foods that will help reduce cholesterol, lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation.

Which food groups have the most science behind their heart-healthy claims?

Oats and barley

The cell walls of oats and barley contain a special type of soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which has a host of benefits for human health. Studies show that it blunts the body's insulin response and boosts immunity, and it may be protective during radiation and chemotherapy. But its role in cholesterol reduction is what counts for heart health.

""Beta-glucans bind to bile acids and cholesterol in the intestines and prevent their absorption into the body,"" CNN contributor and registered dietitian Lisa Drayer said. ""So, if you have high cholesterol, it would be a good idea to incorporate oats or oatmeal for breakfast on a regular basis.""

Other grains, such as rye, wheat and sorghum, contain beta-glucans but in much smaller quantities than oats and barley. Beta-glucans are also found in seaweed, baker's yeast and various species of mushrooms such as reishi, shiitake and maitake.

Research shows that eating 3 grams of beta-glucans a day will reduce cholesterol by up to 10%. According to Heart UK , a British charity dedicated to helping those with high cholesterol, you can accomplish by eating a bowl of oatmeal each day; adding 2 tablespoons of oat bran to your smoothie, soup or entree at lunch; and having an oatmeal cookie for a snack.

Heart UK says you can replace one of those oat servings with 150 grams (⅔ cup) of cooked pearl barley.

Salmon and other fatty fish

Fish oils, especially omega-3 fatty acids, are critical for maintaining a healthy heart. That means fatty fish such as salmon, albacore tuna, mackerel, herring, lake trout and sardines and crustaceans such as lobster, oysters and squid are the protein staples of a heart-healthy diet. They all contain health-protective omega-3s, specifically the long-chain variety known as LC omega-3, which contain eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

Long-chain omega-3s have been shown in human clinical trials to prevent heart attacks by helping the heart maintain its rhythm. Studies show that they also make blood less likely to clot, lower blood pressure, keep blood vessels healthy and less likely to narrow, reduce triglycerides and lower inflammation. Whew!

The shorter chain of omega-3, called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is found abundantly in oils, plants, nuts and seeds, but evidence of its benefit is not as strong.

""The plant-based omega-3s in foods like flaxseed, walnuts and canola oil don't contain DHA and EPA,"" Drayer said. ""And while there are benefits to the plant ones as well, you can't count on them as a source for their longer-chain cousins, because they are not necessarily converted into them once they are in the body.""

Fatty fish like salmon have the most long-chain omega-3s, and the American Heart Association recommends adding a 3½-ounce serving to your diet at least twice a week. Children and pregnant women should be careful to consume fish with lower levels of mercury, the association says, such as fresh and water-packed canned salmon.

However, Drayer says, be careful how you prepare your catch.

""You can make healthy foods unhealthy depending on how you cook them,"" Drayer said. ""For example, if you deep-fry fish, all the unhealthy saturated or trans fat can outweigh the heart-healthy benefits. Ideally, you want to broil, bake, grill or poach -- but in water, not in oil. Oil will contribute lots of extra calories. If a menu doesn't specify, ask how the fish is poached.""

What if fatty fish is just not your thing?

""If you never eat fish, you might consider a fish-oil supplement because of all the research on omega-3's benefits for heart and brain health,"" Drayer said.

""There are some foods fortified with EPA and DHA omega-3s,"" added registered dietitian Rahaf Al Bochi, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""Some of them are eggs, milk, juices, peanut butter and margarine spreads.""

""So instead of having regular spread on your toast, you can add something to your diet that has an added heart benefit,"" Drayer said. ""Why not give yourself an added edge?""

Be aware that most fortified foods have a fraction of the omega-3s of fatty fish and may be the shorter-chain variety.

Dark leafy greens

Salad greens, spinach, kale, swiss chard, collard and mustard greens are rich in vitamins A, C, E and K and contain antioxidants that help rid toxins from the body. But it's their abundance of calcium, magnesium and potassium that puts them on the top 10 list for heart health.

""Potassium, magnesium and calcium are known to play a role in blood pressure regulation,"" said Al Bochi, who specializes in helping patients with Type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for heart disease.

""Potassium is known to help with limiting the effects of sodium on blood pressure,"" she explained, ""And it, along with magnesium and calcium, help the walls of the blood vessels relax, which increases blood flow and reduces blood pressure.""

Greens have minimal calories: One cup of spinach or Swiss chard is only 7 calories, and kale has 33. Nutritionists say it's usually best to get your calcium, magnesium and potassium from foods instead of supplements, so pile that plate high.

Plus, greens -- like most vegetables -- are full of fiber, which helps lower cholesterol levels, prevents constipation (and therefore hemorrhoids) and, by helping you feel full, helps with weight control. And of course, maintaining a healthy weight is a key to good heart health.

Nuts and seeds

Unsalted seeds and nuts are also high in potassium, magnesium and other minerals known to reduce blood pressure.

Studies on pistachios , for example, find that the nut can reduce blood vessel tightening (called peripheral vascular resistance), heart rate, blood pressure and cholesterol. According to one study , a single helping a day was better at lowering blood pressure than two helpings.

Walnuts, pecans, almonds, flaxseed, macadamia nuts and hazelnuts are also good choices. Walnuts are especially high in omega-3s but are the short-chain variety. Still, that's good for the heart.

""Though to a lesser extent than long-chain omega-3s,"" Drayer said, ""alpha linolenic acid (ALA) -- a short-chain omega-3 found in walnuts and flaxseed and canola oil -- has been associated with protection against high blood pressure and heart disease.""

But keep in mind that all nuts are extremely high in calories. So an American Heart Association recommended serving is going to seem tiny: about 1½ ounces or 2 tablespoons of nut butter. Beware of the added salt, sugar or chocolate that is so appealing on nuts -- not good for heart health.

Beets

A surprising choice? Beets turn out to be chock full of nitric oxide, which studies show can help open blood vessels and therefore lower your blood pressure. In fact, a small study of Australian men and women found that drinking 500 grams (about 2½ cups) of beet juice significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) within six hours.

That's not all. Beets and their juice are one of the only sources of betalain, a powerful antioxidant with high anti-inflammatory qualities, which has sparked research into how beets could be used to treat diseases caused by chronic inflammation, such as arthritis cancer and heart failure.

Avocados

Already eating a healthy diet? Be sure to add avocadoes once a day. A study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that replacing saturated fat with one nutrient-packed avocado a day could lead to up to a 13.5 milligrams-per-deciliter reduction in blood pressure. That could be enough to keep some people off blood pressure meds, researchers say.

Avocados are a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids, which can lower both your total cholesterol and your ""bad"" cholesterol (LDL) while maintaining your ""good"" cholesterol (HDL) levels. They can also benefit insulin contro l, which can be very helpful to those with prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes.

Olive oil

A key component of the Mediterranean diet is the use of olive oil for cooking and for dressing salads and vegetables in place of more saturated fats, such as butter.

Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and has been shown to reduce blood pressure and both bad cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing good cholesterol.

HDL is often called the ""friendly scavenger"" because it scours the blood for bad cholesterol and gets rid of it before it clogs arteries. That's why having high levels of HDL is considered good for the heart.

recent study of 300 Spanish men and women at high risk for cardiovascular events sheds some light on how the higher HDL from olive oil might work. Researchers compared people who ate a Mediterranean diet based on nuts and a group based on olive oil. The group who ate more olive oil had better-functioning HDL; in other words, their HDL was more efficient at finding and removing LDL and sending it to the liver as waste.

Regardless of how it works, olive oil is extremely high in calories. It should be used in moderation and as a replacement for more unhealthy fats in the diet.

Legumes

No heart-healthy list would be complete without legumes, which include all kinds of beans, lentils, chickpeas and black-eyed peas.

Legumes help the heart because of their high levels of soluble fiber, which is known to lower both cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the bloodstream.

""Soluble fiber binds to extra LDL cholesterol in the body and disposes it in the form of waste,"" Al Bochi said. ""You can think of it as a type of sponge.""

Studies have shown that eating less than a cup of legumes improved blood pressure , and a randomized controlled trial found that obese subjects who ate two servings a day of legumes and four servings of whole grains reduced their waist circumference, weight, triglycerides and blood pressure.

Legumes contain no cholesterol and are only about 3% fat (unless they are prepared with lard or other unhealthy fats). They are full of iron, manganese, copper, B vitamins, magnesium, zinc and phosphorous, and they are very low on the glycemic index, which means they have less effect on your blood sugar. They are also extremely high in protein; for example, a half-cup of some legumes has 8 grams of protein.

One caveat: Most people eat canned version of beans and other legumes, which will be packed with salt as a preservative. Salt, of course, can raise blood pressure.

""Make sure that you rinse the excess salt and water before consuming,"" Al Bochi said. ""And it's not just beans and lentils. Whether it's canned corn, canned peas, carrots, any type of canned food, it's important to remove the salt.""

Low-fat dairy

It may seem odd to include dairy in a list of top heart-healthy foods, but it turns out that milk, cheese and yogurt can help reduce blood pressure.

In a study by Boston University, researchers followed the eating habits of 75,000 people for up to 30 years and found that women who ate yogurt at least five times a week had a 20% reduction in their risk of developing high blood pressure. Milk and cheese also had an impact on lowering blood pressure, but it was nothing like yogurt, said the researchers.

Men in the study consumed much less yogurt than the women; the effect on their blood pressure was weaker.

""Dairy products contain calcium, potassium and magnesium, which are important minerals to help with blood pressure control,"" Al Bochi said.

Those in the study who benefited most also closely followed the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's DASH diet , which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. Its premise is simple: Eat more veggies, fruits and low-fat dairy foods while cutting way back on any food high in saturated fat, and limit your intake of salt.

The DASH meal plan includes three whole-grain products each day, four to six servings of vegetables, four to six servings of fruit, two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts/seeds/legumes.

""You're getting the combination of benefits by consuming these foods because they do offer more than one heart-healthy nutrient,"" Drayer said.

In the Boston study, men and women who had a higher DASH score and who ate yogurt five or more times each week were 31% less likely to develop hypertension than participants who had low DASH scores and ate little yogurt.

Though the study didn't track the type of yogurt eaten, experts stress choosing low-fat versions.

""Dairy products can contain a high amount of saturated fat, so be sure to choose low-fat products,"" Al Bochi said. ""Saturated fat has been known to increase LDL cholesterol, the bad cholesterol that can cause heart disease.""

A low-sodium, balanced diet

No. 10 on the heart healthy list may seem odd, but it's important. Experts say that rather than focusing on just one or two of the heart healthy foods, you would be better served to eat a well-rounded diet that focuses on healthy foods of all types and colors.

""If you feel like there is a 'superfood' that you want to incorporate on a daily basis, say oats or salmon, that's OK,"" Drayer said, ""but I really feel that eating a variety of healthy foods is best, because you're getting a different nutrient package with each.

""The other thing I worry about is when people focus on one food, they may think that is their key to good health and eat more unhealthy foods,"" Drayer added. ""For example, some people say, 'I eat a lot of kale, so I'm healthy,' and they don't pay attention to the rest of their diet. No one food can undo damage from an unhealthy diet.""

Unless your doctor says otherwise, part of a heart-healthy diet is watching your salt intake. The hidden salt in many of our processed foods make it extremely difficult: It's estimated that Americans get up to 80% of the salt in their diet from processed foods. The American Heart Association has a list of some of the top offenders, called the ""Salty Six"": breads and rolls, cold cuts and cured meats, sandwiches, pizza, soup and chicken.

""Some ways to help reduce the amount of sodium in your diet is to limit the amount of processed foods, the amount of frozen dinners, for example, as well as adding salt to foods yourself,"" Al Bochi said. ""Consider using some herbs and spices as well as fresh lemon and vinegar to add some flavor to your meals.""

Finally, a heart-healthy diet should just be part of an overall heart-healthy plan that includes exercise, weight loss, stress reduction and not smoking."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160712114512-leafy-greens-super-tease.jpg

In fact, watermelon contains more lycopene than raw tomatoes: about 12 milligrams per wedge, versus 3 milligrams per medium tomato.



Although this melon is plenty hydrating on its own, Gans loves to mix it with water in the summertime. ""Keep a water pitcher in the fridge with watermelon cubes in the bottom,"" she says. ""It's really refreshing and a great incentive to drink more water overall.""

cb70838331914551aacca9b481185f45	['Lisa Drayer']	2017-11-17 00:00:00	Fighting salt and sugar cravings, with spicy food	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Fighting salt and sugar cravings, with spicy food	1	"(CNN) There's no magic pill that will cure you of your cravings. But there is something that may help the effort, and it's all-natural.

Research has shown that simply spicing up your diet may help you consume less salt and possibly less sugar, while potentially improving your health even beyond the reduction of salt and sugar.

There is more consistent evidence that spicy food helps curb salt cravings than sugar.

In a study involving more than 600 people from China whose brains were analyzed with PET/CT scans, researchers found that regions stimulated by intake of both salty and spicy foods overlapped. Because of similar activities taking place in this shared space (think of the overlapping parts of a Venn diagram), consuming spicy foods effectively enhanced one's sensitivity to salt, thereby helping people crave and consume less salt.

""We think that spicy food can trick our brain when tasting salty food. It makes us taste the same (level of) saltiness even when a reduced amount of salt is actually consumed,"" said study author Dr. Zhiming Zhu, professor and director of the Department of Hypertension and Endocrinology at the Third Military Medical University in Chongqing, China.

In fact, researchers found that people who regularly enjoy spicy foods consumed 2.5 grams less salt in a day (that's 1,000 fewer milligrams of sodium) compared with those who typically steer clear of spice. They also had lower blood pressure.

It remains to be seen whether the findings can be replicated in other populations outside China, said Richard David Wainford, associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology at the Boston University School of Medicine, in an accompanying editorial. Still, ""a lifestyle intervention that adds taste to the diet, in the form of extra spice and flavor, versus reduction of the pleasure given by the salt we add to our food, may have more success as a public health strategy to promote population-level dietary salt reduction,"" he added.

Spice may have the potential to curb sugar cravings too, though the evidence is mixed. In one study involving 40 students from Denmark, when chili pepper was added to sweet, sour and bitter meals, participants experienced a greater desire to eat sweet foods compared with meals without chili added.

In another study, also from Denmark, people experienced a decreased desire for salty and spicy foods when they ate tomato soup with cayenne pepper compared with eating the soup without pepper. But their desire for sweet and fatty foods significantly increased when they consumed the spicy soup.

No pain, no weight gain?

Capsaicin is the compound in chili peppers that is responsible for the burning sensation we experience when eating them. The compound has the ability to suppress sweet taste, which could also explain some findings.

But while some may enjoy the heat that capsaicin produces, it may also come with an unintended consequence.

""Capsaicin helps fight pain. Most of the time, you hear about this as a topical cream, but eating chili peppers also has benefits. It may be that when the pain goes away, you're stimulated to consume more sweet foods,"" said Mary-Jon Ludy, an associate professor of clinical nutrition at Bowling Green State University.

In a meta-analysis, involving more than 70 studies , funded by the National Institutes of Health and the McCormick Science Institute, researchers state that the balance of the literature suggests the capsaicin suppresses appetite, though the magnitude of the effects is small. ""Purposeful inclusion of these compounds in the diet may aid weight management, albeit modestly,"" the study stated.

(Note that the National Institutes of Health is a federal government agency, and the McCormick Science Institute is an independent research organization that is owned and funded by spice product manufacturer McCormick & Co. Inc. The company said it does not influence the science institute's research priorities.)

The meta-analysis included the Danish study that found increased sugar cravings among those who consumed spicy meals. But it also included a study that found adding spice can actually curb sugar cravings . In that study, when people added half a teaspoon of red pepper to their lunch, they had a decreased desire to eat sugary, fatty and salty foods, and ate about 70 fewer calories at their next meal. The effects were seen only among those who didn't regularly consume red pepper.

""I think that there's something in the novelty of the stimulus that would allow you to eat less,"" said Ludy, who authored the study and the meta-analysis. ""In terms of the work with red pepper, I think that that's an important piece of the puzzle. If you are adding a spicy meal every couple of weeks, it might be enough to have an effect ... but if you have it every day, the effect goes away, because you get used to it.""

A little dash will do ya

To get started with spice, Ludy recommends sprinkling red pepper flakes into eggs in the morning. You can also use spice when making a rub for meat or when seasoning vegetables, soups, pasta or curry dishes.

She also recommends adding red pepper flakes to a meal in anticipation of a tempting dessert. ""It may give you that extra piece of security,"" she said. Though not specific to sweet taste, cinnamon, ginger and saffron are other pungent spices with appetite suppressive effects, according to Ludy.

However you choose to use spice, it's wise to start slowly. ""Remember that a tiny bit of spice can go a long way!"" Ludy said. If the heat is an issue, you can calm your taste buds by pairing hot spices with healthy fats, such as avocados and nuts, according to Ludy. ""They help break down the chemical that causes the burn.""

If you're new to spicy peppers, she recommends starting with milder varieties, such as jalapeno or serrano, which cause less burn than cayenne or habanero. ""These peppers still contain some capsaicin but not as much. Although I haven't researched it directly, my guess is that there would still be appetite effects (perhaps of a lesser magnitude) ... but if you can't tolerate higher quantities of spice, something is better than nothing, right?"""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120301012839-red-chilies-story-top.jpg

Experts suggest using it as a flavor enhancer rather than the focus of a meal

(CNN) Yes, cheese is nutrient-rich -- and tasty -- but it's best to consume it in small portions.

""Cheese does contain some important nutrients, including calcium and protein, along with vitamin B12 and zinc. However, the calories can add up quickly if you aren't mindful,"" said Kelly Pritchett, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Softer cheeses tend to have fewer calories than hard cheeses: an ounce of whole-milk ricotta (approximately 2 tablespoons) has about 50 calories, an ounce of feta has 75 calories, and an ounce of whole-milk mozzarella has 85 calories. But an ounce of Swiss (one slice) has 108 calories, and an ounce of cheddar has 114 calories (picture about a one-inch cube, depending on the kind).

For the same calories, you can have a cup of black bean soup and probably feel just as full.

Cheese is also high in saturated fat, which is known to increase LDL cholesterol, the ""bad"" cholesterol. In fact, cheese is one of the biggest sources of saturated fat in the US diet

Limit portions to 1 ounce of dark chocolate daily

(CNN) Yes, dark chocolate has compounds that offer health benefits and can be enjoyed without guilt, even on a daily basis. But the portion size matters, since too many bites can contribute extra fat, sugar and calories and negate its health benefits.

Dark chocolate is rich in cocoa solids, which contain compounds known as flavanols. At high levels, cocoa flavanols have been shown to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol, improve cognition and possibly lower the risk of diabetes. Dark chocolate has the highest amount of cocoa flavanols; milk chocolate has less, and white chocolate has none.

But while cocoa flavanols in dark chocolate make it a healthful treat, they give it a bitter flavor. Manufacturers may process chocolate to make it more palatable, but doing so can remove some of these beneficial compounds

Factors in processing, including fermentation and roasting, which deepen the flavor and give chocolate its distinct aroma, can affect flavanol content, explained Matt Hartings, assistant professor of chemistry at American University.

""Roasting generates all sorts of new flavors ... and to generate those flavors, you have to destroy molecules in the unroasted bean ... and there is always the chance that it is destroying compounds that we want around, including flavanols,"" Hartings said.

734ae13eb4554518ad8bce80866de6a0	['Lisa Drayer']	2017-10-17 00:00:00	How to break carb cravings, once and for all	https://www.cnn.com/	US	How to break carb cravings, once and for all	1	"(CNN) If you're like many people I know, the thought of giving up pasta and bread in an effort to shed a few pounds (or more) might seem like an unfair punishment -- perhaps even a tease, especially when those foods seem to be on everyone else's plates.

The truth is, despite the popularity of low-carb diets, which often send the message that we should drastically cut back on this food group, carbohydrates are some of the most important things we consume. They are key to regulating blood sugar and providing energy throughout our bodies. Without them, our bodies will rely on protein, breaking it down for energy instead of using it in its preferred role of growing and maintaining tissues.

What's more, eating the ""right"" kinds of carbs can keep us healthier.

""The people who live the longest, healthiest lives -- who have the lowest rates of diabetes, heart disease and cancer -- their diets are all rich in healthy carbs, including beans, legumes, whole grains and fruit,"" said Tamara Duker Freuman, a New York City-based registered dietitian.

And so there's nothing wrong with a pasta meal (though whole grain is preferred) or even a sandwich on whole-wheat bread for lunch every day. Simply, the problem is not that we consume carbs; it's that we often consume the wrong kinds of carbs -- and very large portions of them.

Processed carbs are problem carbs

Highly processed carbs -- white bread, sugary cereal, white rice, regular pasta and bagels, for example -- produce rapid rises and drops in blood sugar, which can lead to weight gain. They also can lead to something called metabolic syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk for heart disease, stroke and diabetes.

Metabolic syndrome is ""the combination of high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, insulin resistance and obesity,"" explained Dr. David Ludwig, professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""And processed carbs are the main dietary drivers."" Studies show that ""processed carbs top the list for weight gain and diabetes risk,"" he said.

The tricky part is that the more processed, refined carbs we eat, the more we crave. And so it seems almost impossible to get off the carb-craving hamster wheel.

According to Ludwig, who wrote the book ""Always Hungry? Conquer Cravings, Retrain Your Fat Cells, and Lose Weight Permanently,"" cravings have to do with our consumption of these highly processed, ""fast-acting"" carbs, which he says are not fundamentally different from sugar, in the biological sense. White bread or any other processed carbohydrate will melt into glucose very quickly -- and so like sugar, it raises blood sugar at a faster rate than slower-digesting carbs that are less processed and higher in fiber. The problem is, that rapid spike in blood sugar is eventually followed by a crash.

Insulin: Miracle-Gro for fat cells

According to Ludwig, what drives most carb cravings is not the taste of the foods per se but rather a biological urge to eat something to restore your blood sugar. And it has to do with the hormone insulin. ""Processed carbs cause more insulin secretion, calorie for calorie, than any food,"" he said.

When you eat processed carbs, blood sugar rises rapidly, and insulin quickly follows, directing incoming calories into liver, muscle and fat cells. But of these, only fat cells have virtually limitless ability to store calories, and too many get trapped there, according to Ludwig. A short while later, the calories in the bloodstream are low, and the body runs out of available fuel, making you hungry too soon after the meal.

In essence, when fat cells get too much energy, there's not enough to fuel the brain, which is constantly monitoring the calories in your blood. ""When (the brain) sees calories are dropping, it triggers hunger and cravings,"" Ludwig said.

And it all relates back to that initial insulin response. ""Insulin is the Miracle-Gro for fat cells,"" he said. ""When fat cells grow, we get hungry."" And so the cycle repeats, eventually causing weight gain.

How to break carb cravings

Nutrition experts say that breaking carb cravings is not about getting rid of carbs entirely but rather cutting back on highly processed fast-acting carbs and eating more high-quality ones that are high in fiber and low in added sugars, such as beans, whole grains, fruit and vegetables. If you don't know how to get started, this plan can help:

1. Cut out all starchy carbs for one week. This includes all pasta, bread, rice, bagels and potatoes, as well as pizza, crackers, pretzels, chips, cookies and cake.

By cutting starchy carbs and replacing them with foods that have a more modest impact on blood sugar, you can achieve more steady blood sugar control and better manage your cravings, according to Freuman.

A day might include egg whites and cheese with berries for breakfast, yogurt for a snack, a grilled chicken salad with beans for lunch, an apple for a snack and a piece of fish and veggies for dinner.

2. Slash the sugary carbs too, including candy and sugar-sweetened beverages. These sugary carbs rapidly flood the bloodstream, providing lots of sugar without any added nutrition.

3. Add some fat. ""Many high-fat foods are luscious and do not cause an insulin release, so they keep your blood sugar much more stable,"" Ludwig said. Examples include nuts, nut butters, avocado, olive oil, dark chocolate and full-fat dairy. ""When you are eating them, you don't miss the processed carbs at all!""

4. After the first week, you can gradually add back high-quality starchy carbs, starting with breakfast.

""Research in a variety of populations has shown that eating carbs at breakfast seems to dampen the blood sugar effect of eating carbs at lunch,"" Freuman said. What this means is that on a day that you skip breakfast, you may be more likely to have a blood sugar spike after eating a carb-rich lunch, compared with a day when you eat breakfast but have the same lunch. In other words, ""don't skip breakfast, and don't skip carbs at breakfast,"" Freuman said.

High-quality carbs -- including minimally processed grains, along with non-starchy vegetables, whole fruits and beans -- are the ones to choose. They are delicious and slower-digesting, thanks to the way they are naturally packaged, Ludwig said. ""If you eat wheat berries, your body has to digest the intact grain kernel, and that's a slow process. But if you mill it and turn it into flour, now that whole package has been broken. Too much of these 'naked carbs' (stripped of their bran and germ, which contain nutrients) will cause metabolic problems for most people.""

Breakfast examples with high-quality carbs include steel-cut oats with nuts, seeds and cinnamon; rye crisp bread with scrambled eggs and berries; or Greek yogurt topped with fruit. Freuman recommends beans at breakfast too, ""as in a Mexican breakfast with eggs, beans, avocado and salsa.""

5. After the second week, you can add back high-quality starchy carbs (i.e. minimally processed grains) to lunch. Good lunch examples include a chickpea or quinoa salad, bean or lentil soups, mushroom barley soup or a sandwich with whole-grain bread. Whole-wheat pasta or chickpea pasta is a good choice too, according to Freuman, though it should take up only about a quarter of the plate, to allow room for veggies and protein.

For the longer term

6. Continue to skip starchy carbs at dinner. ""At dinner, when we eat carbs, we are much more likely to have a blood sugar spike and to store that food energy as fat versus having it available for useable energy,"" Freuman said.

""The metabolic response to a carbier meal at night is less favorable than when we eat carbs earlier in the day, so if there is ever one meal that you want eat low-carb, it's dinner ... and if you want to include them, choose wisely and keep the portions low,"" she added.

7. Continue to limit refined carbs, such as white bread and white rice. It might be difficult to forgo white basmati rice, pizza or sushi entirely, but limit these foods to a few times per week.

8. Continue to avoid foods high in added sugars. If you have a sweet tooth, limit treats to 100 to 150 calories per day, depending on your goals.

And note that anyone with a medical issue should always consult their doctor before starting a new diet plan."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120612113824-carbs-spelled-in-carbs-super-tease.jpg

(CNN) Consider the glorious but humble donkey. According to the Bible, Jesus rode one, not a horse, into Jerusalem.

The significance was that it was a common man's animal for the common man's king, rather than a more traditionally royal steed. And its Sunday school lore that his mother rode one from Nazareth while pregnant, though that's not in the official canon. I checked.

Domesticated for about 5,000 years, donkeys have been put to work for humanity's historically changing needs. They've been the family car, our U-Haul vans, engines pulling barges in canals and wagons out West, and they've been our workmates -- if you work in a mine or on a farm. They're still used in military operations to carry ground air missiles over difficult terrain.

Burros, as the Spanish call them, walk at about a human's foot speed. They rarely kick or bite. They seem to have a calming effect on horses and humans. And they don't get nearly the respect they deserve, the Rodney Dangerfields of the animal kingdom.

Like a cross between a Tesla and a wheelbarrow, donkeys are beasts of burden that can carry up to 300 pounds for more than two weeks in the mountains, while needing very little food or water. They're sort of the camels of the West. In fact, they're the camels of the East, North and South, too, as donkeys continue to thrive in North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa.

As some industries faded, the donkey soon added racing partner to its resume. When the US mining industry started to dry up in the 1930s and '40s, some enterprising Coloradans came up with the idea of attracting spectators to their towns by hosting an ultramarathon of human-donkey pairs -- The World Championship Pack Burro Race.

""They teach us so much,"" said pack burro race director Brad Wann. ""They teach us humility. They connect us with nature. Burros have the ability to reach into your soul.""

The first race was in 1949, which makes it, according Wann, the second-oldest continuously run marathon in the country after the Boston Marathon.

The race also lends itself to a variety of puns. For example, the winner of the annual pack burro championship is the first to get his or her ass over the finish line. Wann's title is media relations officer for the Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation . There are eight of these eye-rollers in this article if you'd like to spot them all.

But it's still a serious sport, even if it has a sense of humor. "" Haulin' Ass "" is the title of a very straight documentary about the sport.

A burro-ful day

Originally the race extended between Leadville and Fairplay, located in the middle of the state and only about 11 miles apart as the crow flies, but separated by a mountain. Legend holds that it was inspired by two miners who struck gold simultaneously and raced back to town to claim the find. The real story is that the race was inspired by a desire to keep former mining towns from turning into ghosts.

Now both towns have their own races, part of an annual series of eight in Colorado. Fairplay, is the longest (29 miles), tied for highest (more than 13,000 feet), and the one that retained the World Championship title. The town is also home to the Prunes Monument, possibly the only monument in the world erected to honor a donkey. Prunes worked alongside a miner for more than 60 years.

Race day, in July, was a cool one of blue skies. This year 89 -- a record number -- of human-burro pairs competed in the 70th world championship, assembling in the Old West-looking Fairplay. Wann estimates at least 150,000 people showed up to watch the start of the race.

The smell of excitement and excrement was in the air as the starter gun signaled a mass start of two lengths. The 29-mile race had 20 pairs and 3,300 feet of elevation gain and a short course of 15 miles had another 69 pairs.

The start of the race is critical, explained Wann. ""Don't break their will, let the burro set the pace early on instead of shutting it down,"" he explained. ""Burros will pair up and want to go that pace, and you have to feel that out. So run as fast you can -- sprint if the donkey does. If you can't do that you'll have a slow donkey the rest of the race. It's a burro race, not a human race.""

The course also ends in Fairplay, running through South Park (the show of the same name has somehow not done a burro racing episode), and then heading up dirt roads, trails and rocky terrain to the 13,185-foot summit of Mosquito Pass. (Or should that be Mosquito P-ass?)

The age range of the human runners at this year's world championship was 15 to 70, and they came from all over the US, Europe, Canada and even Africa. The California team brought in their own donkeys. About 65% were repeat runners addicted to the niche sport which consistently only takes place in Colorado, the state where it was born.

About a third of the runners were women this year. In fact, the first woman to ever compete was Edna Miller, with her burro Pill, in 1951, nearly 20 years before the first woman ran the Boston Marathon (against the rules, even then).

The donks -- as insiders may refer to them -- that competed this year have adorable and delicious names such as Buckwheat, Hershey and Sweet Pea. Past winners have included BonBon and Cream Puff. My favorite name for a competitor this year was ReDONKulous. This year included 16 mini-donkeys on the short course.

And don't call donkeys mules, which are actually half donkey and half horse breeds. Those half-assed animals aren't allowed to race in the pack burro circuit.

Rules state that the donks (I'm an insider now) must carry mining equipment: a pick, gold pan, shovel and saddle. This weighs about 16 pounds and for the mini-donkeys that's all they need; standard-sized donkeys must add weights to a minimum of 33 pounds. The rope attaching the team can't be longer than 15 feet and the runners don't dress as miners, though the occasional cowboy hat may allude to an earlier era.

Like any ultramarathon, especially with elevation, endurance requires training. And in this case some animal husbandry skills as well. As a result, there are, of course, comical moments for bystanders watching when the donkey protests. Sometimes a burro will just shut down. In previous races, teams have had to drop out when this happens.

The air may be thin on oxygen up on Mosquito Pass, but the mountain views are amazing. Green and grey peaks are in all directions, the views as wild and West as some of pack animals.

This year's winning team was Kirt Courkamp and his burro Mary Margaret, finishing the 29 miles in just over 6 hours and winning the $1,000 first place prize. These two locals won the last two years and this year won in Leadville and Buena Vista too, collectively known as the Triple Crown.

Breaking in

""In the whole world, there are probably fewer than 1,000 people who have ever competed in a pack-burro race,"" the late Denver Post columnist Ed Quillen wrote in 2007 , arguing for it to be the state's official sport. (In 2012, pack burro racing was designated a summer heritage sport of Colorado.)

If you want to be among this elite crew, your training is two-fold. You need to condition yourself to run long distances — putting in the hours on trail runs and at high altitudes -- as the pack burro race is a very challenging course.

Then there is driving a donkey. They don't need to acclimate to the altitude or learn how to properly fuel themselves with calories and hydration to go the distance. But runners still benefit with getting as many miles together as possible.

There are techniques and personality differences among the animals that need to be m-ass-tered to have a successful run. ""If the burro doesn't trust you, or like you, or you are pushing too hard,"" said Wann, ""it's not going to work.""

Organizers don't recommend it but you can show up the day before a burro pack race and rent a donkey. Amber Wann, a self described ""donkey matchmaker"" and wife of Brad, rents them for races and tries to match running speed and equine experience.

""Burro racing is a very mental game,"" he added. ""We're navigating through some of the roughest terrain in the world and you have to build a relationship with your ass to make that happen.""

Running with a donkey is a bit of give and take, literally. Sometimes you're pulling them, other times they're pulling you. Uphill they can be a real ass-et if they are in the lead and pulling a bit. But going downhill, runners want to be in the lead lest they find themselves getting dragged by a fast and enthusiastic 900-pound burro which can haul ass at speeds up to 40 miles per hour.

On flats, either teammate can be in the lead, or side-by-side, but human runners are still doing the steering.

You control a donkey through their nose, pulling back on the rope to slow down, like a gas pedal of pressure-and-release to change speed. A whistle or a ""hup-hup!"" can get 'em goin' and the classic ""whoa"" can slow 'em down. The donkey of course doesn't know where it's going. Humans are the ""GPS for the critters,"" Wann said.

Gear-wise, runners need the right shoes, clothes, running vests and fuel for an ultramarathon. And the burros, in addition to getting a clean bill of health from a vet, need the old timey mining equipment and added weight to carry.

Ass-essing risk and reward

As with any ultramarathon trail run, injuries are always possible. According to a 2015 study involving 1,212 active ultrarunners, they suffered about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners , though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.

Being tethered to a donkey adds risk of injury to runners, of course. If you trip, you can get serious road rash from getting dragged along. One year a runner bruised or broke some ribs when her burro kicked her in the chest.

The rules don't allow runners to ride the donkey, but in the race's history, injured runners have been carried down the mountain on their partners' back, as they're out of the race anyway.

Donkeys get injured too, but in 70 years of racing, not one animal has died or been injured beyond recovery.

Animal rights groups have raised eyebrows about the sport but organizers stress the humane treatment of the burros. ""Any contestant mistreating his animal may be disqualified,"" the race rules state. ""No needles, electric prods, narcotics, clubs or whips, other than the halter rope, may be used."" But the runners' love for their donkey partners makes this rule seemingly superfluous.

Organizers also point out that donkeys enjoy the race as much as the ultra-runners. ""If you observe donkeys in the wild, they aren't sedentary creatures,"" wrote Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation member Sheri L. Thompson on the sport's race website. ""In the wild, donkeys are very trim athletic animals"" and ""they exercise all day long.""

""They are willing participants,"" Thompson writes, alluding to the burro's famous stubbornness. ""If they don't want to go, you can't make them do anything."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180907171631-03-pack-burro-race-super-tease.jpeg

You need to take rest days

Make sure you have the right gear

Running is a great way to get in shape and just about everyone can do it. You don't need access to a fancy gym, expensive equipment, or other people to do the workout. You can simply throw on your sneakers and head out the door for a run. Easy as that!

Given that it's so easy to take up the sport, a lot of beginners jump right into running without actually knowing what it takes to establish a healthy routine. Many make a number of common mistakes, which can interfere with training or lead to injury. If you're just starting out, keep these things in mind to help you increase your chances of running success.

Doing too much too soon

One of the biggest mistakes newbie runners make is doing too much too soon. Picking up a new hobby like running is no doubt exciting, but novice runners need to ease into the sport by building up a mileage base before increasing the distance, intensity, and frequency of their runs. Slowly easing into a training program will help reduce the risk of injury, so you can continue on with your new running routine. Many experts suggest increasing your mileage by no more than 10% each week.

It also allows us to understand and label emotions as well as express and regulate them, according to Yale University's Marc Brackett.

Most of us would probably like to think that we can do all of the above. We spot and understand emotions in ourselves and others and label them accurately in order to guide our thoughts and actions.

But many of us tend to overestimate our own emotional intelligence, according to Brackett, a professor in the Child Study Center at Yale and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.

That's important because experts say the ability to read, understand and respond to emotions in ourselves and other people is a crucial factor in predicting our health, happiness and personal and professional success.

So maybe we all need to take a breath and invest a little more time in schooling ourselves on what it means to be emotionally intelligent.

What is emotional intelligence?

The theory of emotional intelligence -- and the term itself -- originated at Yale and the University of New Hampshire. Peter Salovey, the 23rd president of Yale University, and John ""Jack"" Mayer, professor of psychology at the University of New Hampshire, wrote up the theory in 1990, Brackett said.

Their work demonstrated how emotions had a marked impact on an individual's thinking and behavior, said Robin Stern, associate director for the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and an educator, author and licensed psychoanalyst.

Experts have continued to build on that framework to refine definitions of what exactly is at the core of of emotional intelligence. ""Emotional intelligence is being smart about your feelings. It's how to use your emotions to inform your thinking and use your thinking to inform your emotions,"" she said.

It's having an awareness of how your emotions drive your decisions and behaviors so you can effectively engage with and influence others, said Sara Canaday, a leadership speaker and author. Individuals who are emotionally intelligent tend to be empathetic, can look at situations from an alternative point of view, are considered open-minded, bounce back from challenges and pursue their goals despite any obstacles they might face, according to Canaday.

""Some people think of emotional intelligence as a soft skill or the ability or the tendency to be nice. It's really about understanding what is going on for you in the moment so that you can make conscious choices about how you want to use your emotions and how you want to manage yourself and how you want to be seen in the world,"" Stern said.

""People with more emotional intelligence are healthier, happier and more effective,"" Brackett said.

Why emotional intelligence matters

Canaday further suggests that emotional intelligence is a better predictor of career success than an impressive résumé or a high IQ score

Wait, really?

Well ... just reflect on your own work experiences, Canaday suggests.

Has anyone you worked with ever been let go or asked to leave, even when they had the competency or technical skills for the job?

""We might be hired for technical talents, but we are often fired because we lack emotional intelligence,"" Canaday said.

Individuals with a low level of emotional intelligence can be successful, she said, but she argues that those individuals could be even more successful if they had a higher level of emotional intelligence.

""It is how well you can collaborate, how well you engage with others and influence. It's the stories you can tell, the way you can bring data to life in a way that connects with others. Those are the things that are going to set you apart.""

Emotional intelligence tests

Behavioral scientists have created a number of emotional intelligence self-assessments, usually broken down into ""your ability to manage yourself, your ability to manage relationships, your self-awareness and your social awareness,"" according to Canaday.

Your results will be measured along with others who have taken the assessment to give some indication of where you fall on the spectrum from low to high emotional intelligence.

But Brackett warns that ""measurement is a tricky subject.""

In his early research, he found that people tend to overestimate their emotional intelligence, which is why he believes you must measure it through performance assessments. In a performance assessment, people are required to problem-solve; they must decode facial expressions or strategize in an emotionally tense situation. That way, their knowledge and skills can be tested as opposed to their beliefs about them.

Another form of an emotional intelligence test is a ""360 assessment.""

In the workplace setting, a 360 assessment is a process involving feedback from colleagues and supervisors evaluating a person emotional intelligence. Canaday believes that we often ""see ourselves differently than others do.""

When a coworker takes the 360 assessment of you it provides an opportunity to compare it to your self-assessment. Another way to take a 360 assessment without undergoing a formal test is to ask a trusted adviser, perhaps a current or former boss, to evaluate your emotional intelligence, she said.

But, Canaday cautions, If you ask for someone's feedback, be prepared to accept what they share. ""This stuff can feel very personal. On one hand, we say we want to learn and grow, but on the other hand, we want to be accepted just the way we are, and those two human traits run counter.""

Can I improve my emotional intelligence?

So maybe you need to improve your emotional intelligence. How do you do that?

From the earliest ages, children should be taught how to recognize their emotions, understand what those emotions mean and label them accurately in order to to express and manage themselves , Stern said.

For adults who did not receive a solid education on emotional intelligence, improving will require some hard work. Canaday suggests creating an action plan including specific goals. ""Pick one or two areas where you want to grow, and get some advice on how to best start to embody whatever factor of emotional intelligence you are trying to develop.""

If you are trying to gain better control of your anger, for example, you might find a healthy outlet for it -- whether it be yoga meditation or boxing

Canaday also suggests seeking out perspectives from those who may not agree with you. ""Be intentional about that. Take active steps to do that. If you constantly surround yourself with people who believe just like you do, then you are hearing the same conversations, and you are not growing, and you are not learning to be open to perspectives.""

Brackett advises seeking out strategies that are effective for managing emotions. Practice them and then evaluate how those strategies are working for you. It's important to ""spend time reflecting on and thinking about your influence and how people respond to your emotions, be more self- and socially aware about your presence.""

Stern suggests prolonging the time between when you are triggered by something and when you respond. Pause, slow down and take a deep breath. Imagine what your best self looks like. Taking the time to pause and think about what your best self would do in each situation may help you avoid letting your emotions control you. You are allowing yourself time to manage your emotions.

45574d994dd74d3c9f3960466ee5ef9a	['Christian Jarrett', 'The Science Of Us']	2015-08-17 00:00:00	Want a happy marriage? Science says to do this	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Want a happy marriage? Science says to do this	1	"Have you ever waited with excitement to share some amazingly good news with your partner, only to experience a surge of frustration and resentment when he or she barely reacts to your announcement? As a society, we place a huge amount of emphasis on being there for each other when we're in need, but past research has actually shown that relationship satisfaction is influenced as much, if not more, by how we react to each other's good news. Whereas emotional support from a partner when we're down can have the unfortunate side-effect of making us feel indebted and more aware of our negative emotions, a partner's positive reaction to our good news can magnify the benefits of that good fortune and make us feel closer to them.

Now an unusual brain-imaging study , published in Human Brain Mapping, has added to this picture, showing that the relationship satisfaction of longtime married elderly women is particularly related to the neural activity they show in response to their husbands' displays of positive emotion, rather than negative emotion.

Psychologist Raluca Petrican at the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto and her colleagues at the University of Toronto recruited 14 women with an average age of 72 who'd been married for an average of 40 years. The researchers scanned these women's brains as they watched some carefully prepared videos.

The silent 10-second videos showed each woman's husband or a stranger displaying an emotion that mismatched the way the video clip was labeled in a one-sentence description on the screen. For example, the clip might show the husband smiling or laughing about a happy memory (such as the first house they bought), but the video was labeled misleadingly to suggest that the man was showing this emotion while talking about a sad memory (such as the time he got fired). Other videos showed the reverse mismatch: a negative emotional display, ostensibly shown while talking about the memory of a happy event.

Essentially, the videos were designed to make the women feel like they were seeing their husband or the stranger display a surprising emotional reaction that didn't match their own feelings. The real-world equivalent would be a situation in which a husband is happy about something that his wife doesn't ""get""; and the questions are whether she will notice, and whether she is she more sensitive to this incongruent emotion in her husband than she would be in a stranger.

The first important finding to emerge from this setup was that the women showed enhanced overall brain activity -- which suggests more mental and emotional neural processing -- when watching the videos of their husbands compared with videos of the strangers, but only when the videos showed displays of surprisingly incongruent positive emotion. During the other types of videos (when the men appeared to display strangely negative emotion), the women's brains showed just as much overall activity when watching a stranger as when watching their husband. In other words, their levels of whole-brain activity betrayed a special sensitivity to their husband's (versus a stranger's) unexpected positive emotion.

This jibes with the past research that's shown it's our response to our partners' positive news that is all-important for relationship satisfaction. Remember that these women had been married for decades, so it's likely that they and their husbands have been doing something right relationship-wise. The brain-imaging data suggest part of the reason might be that the women are acutely tuned to when their husbands are showing happiness that's personal to them (rather than common to both partners).

This specific interpretation trips up a little with another main result: The women's levels of marital satisfaction (according to a questionnaire) correlated with the amount of neural processing they showed in response to their husbands positive and negative emotion.

However, the special importance of how we respond to our partners' positive emotion was supported by another key finding. Namely, women who scored higher on relationship satisfaction showed more brain activation in regions thought to contain mirror neurons (neurons that are considered important for empathy) when watching their spouses than they did when watching a stranger. Moreover, this enhanced mirror-neuron activity was especially present for the videos showing their husbands' positive, rather than negative, emotion. Again, this appears to support the idea that marital happiness goes hand in hand with sensitivity to our partners' positive emotion (though the researchers acknowledge a different or complementary interpretation that people in happy relationships have a suppressed response to their partners' incongruent negative emotion).

We need to interpret these preliminary and complex findings with caution. And the exclusive focus on wives' reactions to their husbands' emotions does lend the study a slightly retro '70s vibe -- what about the way that husbands respond to their wives' emotions, and the importance of that for the marital happiness of both parties? But that said, the results are tantalizing in suggesting that at a neural level, people in a long-term, committed relationship are especially sensitive to their partners' positive emotion, and particularly so when this emotion is different from their own. This neatly complements other past research showing, for example, that people who are unable to differentiate their partners' emotions from their own (they assume they're the same), tend to be viewed by their partners as more controlling and smothering.

As a whole, this entire body of research gives pause for thought. How do you react when your partner arrives home on an emotional high? Would you only notice if you were feeling happy too?"	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120511064149-couple-holding-hands-silhouette-story-top.jpg
8cefb1d2bc3249f58d48af3ea0283e3f	['Jacqueline Howard']	2018-03-14 00:00:00	Dementia study ties your risk to your fitness level	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Dementia study ties your risk to your fitness level	1	"(CNN) Your stamina -- or the time it takes for you to reach peak exhaustion during exercise -- can be tied to your dementia risk, and a new study reveals how.

The study, published Wednesday in the medical journal Neurology , found that women with high cardiovascular fitness, or high stamina, had an 88% lower risk of dementia than women who were moderately fit.

""I was not surprised that there was an association, but I was surprised that it was such a strong association between the group with highest fitness and decreased dementia risk,"" said Helena Hörder, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, who was first author on the study.

Dementia is the name for a group of symptoms caused by disorders that affect the brain , often leading to memory loss or other problems with brain function. Alzheimer's disease , an irreversible and progressive brain disease, is the most common type of dementia.

About 5.4 million people in the United States are estimated to be living with Alzheimer's disease , and it is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

About 850,000 people in the United Kingdom have dementia as a whole, according to the UK's National Health Service

Worldwide, about 50 million people have dementia, and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year, according to the World Health Organization

The new study involved 191 women in Sweden, 38 to 60 years old, who completed an ergometer cycling test to evaluate their cardiovascular fitness.

During the test, the women's workload was measured, based on how much weight or resistance could be added to the bicycle before they became fatigued.

""The level that you are so exhausted that you have to interrupt the test is a measure, in watts, of your work capacity,"" Hörder said. ""Cardiovascular fitness or endurance can also be tested in a submaximal test where you don't push the person to maximal capacity.""

Some of the women had to interrupt their cycling test at submaximal workload, before being pushed to maximal capacity, mainly due to changes seen on an electrocardiograph or due to high blood pressure.

Based on their crude peak workload, the women were separated into three groups: Fifty-nine were in the ""low fitness"" group, 92 were ""medium fitness,"" and 40 were ""high fitness.""

Those cycling tests were conducted in 1968, and the women were followed over a 44-year period until 2012. During that time, the researchers tracked the women's health, taking a close look at who was diagnosed with dementia and who was not.

The researchers found that among all of the women, 44 of them (or 23%) developed dementia from 1968 to 2012. Yet among those who interrupted their cycling test at submaximal workload, that percentage jumped to 45%.

""Many of those who interrupted the test at submax, very low watt level, probably had indications for a poor cardiovascular health status,"" Hörder said. ""This might indicate that processes in the cardiovascular system might be ongoing many decades before onset of dementia diagnosis.""

The researchers also found that the average age at dementia onset was 11 years older in the ""high fitness"" group than in the ""medium fitness"" group, and the most pronounced risk reduction was seen among those with the highest fitness: ""High compared to medium fitness decreased the risk of dementia by 88%,"" the researchers wrote.

The study had some limitations, including that it involved a small sample of women in Sweden. More research is needed to determine whether similar findings would occur in a larger, more diverse group.

Also, the findings were not causal. So more research is also needed to determine whether improved fitness could have positive effects on dementia risk and when in life a high fitness level is most important.

For instance, other factors could have influenced the findings to help lower dementia risk, regardless of physical activity habits. Genetics or the cognitive stimulation of fitness could have influenced dementia risk, as well as the social aspects of fitness, as loneliness has been linked to dementia

""One of the missing pieces of a study like this -- and really the weakness in the literature to date -- is that the kinds of studies that we have mostly seen are association studies. These are studies of correlations, and they can't necessarily talk about causality,"" said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago, who was not involved in the new study.

Still, he said, ""the picture that is really emerging from the literature is a picture about the importance of fitness in midlife, not just old age, when it comes to protecting your brain health and preventing or delaying Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.""

The new study adds to that overall growing body of evidence turning a spotlight on dementia and modifiable risk factors , such as poor cardiovascular health, a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, smoking or excessive alcohol consumption

So people could try to reduce their risk of cognitive decline by engaging in regular cardiovascular exercise , stopping smoking, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, staying socially engaged, challenging their minds by reading or playing games and of course taking care of their heart health, according to the Alzheimer's Association

""There's a very strong connection between cardiovascular health -- so the health of your heart and your circulatory system -- and the health of your brain,"" Fargo said.

""The reason for that is because the brain actually is what we would call a highly vascularized organ, meaning that your brain has many blood vessels,"" he said. ""The demand for nutrient-, oxygen-rich blood in the brain is very high compared to other organs, and so anything a person can do to increase their cardiovascular fitness level is likely to have positive benefits on brain health."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160127173358-happy-old-people-2-super-tease.jpg
a7660f48ae8c42efb780b1ca05656dc9	['Susan Scutti']	2018-01-03 00:00:00	The top fitness trends for 2018	https://www.cnn.com/	US	The top fitness trends for 2018	1	"(CNN) High-intensity interval training will be the No. 1 fitness trend in the coming year, while smartphone exercise apps that prompt your activities will be out -- or so says the Worldwide Survey of Fitness Trends for 2018 .

Such training, known as HIIT, typically involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by a short period of rest or recovery: intermittently sprinting for 30 seconds, for example, during a moderate-pace jog.

The US national physical activity guidelines recommend 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week with additional muscle-strengthening exercise for adults and 60 minutes a day for children, noted Walter R. Thompson, author of the report and prtesident of the American College of Sports Medicine. ""So if you step it up a little bit and get your heart rate up and move from, say, walking to jogging, it decreases to 75 minutes per week.""

HIIT is a worthy way to meet your physical activity guidelines, he said. ""But there's a word of caution with that: Anytime you do high-intensity anything, there may be an increased risk of injury.""

If you doubt your ability to safely exercise in high-intensity bursts, Thompson recommends that you ""get a good physical exam"" before starting a program.

Over the past 12 years, the editors of the American College of Sports Medicine's Health & Fitness Journal have circulated an electronic survey to thousands of professionals, including personal trainers and physical therapists, to predict the biggest health and fitness trends for the coming year.

This year's survey, which included responses from 4,133 fitness professionals around the globe, placed ""group training"" -- classes involving more than five participants -- in the No. 2 slot. Meanwhile, ""wearable technology"" -- such as activity trackers and smartwatches -- came in third, and ""body weight training"" -- the use of your own body weight as a form of resistance while doing modified pushups and other exercises -- came in fourth. ""Strength training,"" or the use of barbells and weights, placed fifth.

Thompson said the survey was developed for two purposes, the first being ""to help guide the fitness industry.""

Although most of the industry is ""commercial properties,"" the survey is also helpful to community-based organizations, corporate wellness programs and medical fitness centers.

""They need some direction as to what will be the next trend in the industry so that when they use their valuable resources for something, they know it's going to work,"" Thompson said.

""We also do it from the perspective of people who use the gym, the clients,"" he said. ""It helps them identify gyms across the country that are offering the best kinds of exercise programs.""

Three new trends found a place on the top 20 list: ""licensure for fitness professionals"", ""core training"" and ""sport-specific Training."" Licensure refers to the general trend toward more regulation of fitness professionals, such as personal trainers. Core work stresses strength and conditioning of the stabilizing muscles of the abdomen, thorax and back. Sport-specific exercising is usually geared toward younger athletes and focuses on a single sport, such as tennis or boxing.

Meanwhile, ""work-site health promotion"" (which ranked 16th in last year's survey) and ""outcomes measures"" (previously 18th) fell from the top 20 list. In other words, incentive programs in employer-based health care benefits plans and comparison measurements to improve performance are no longer fashionable among the gym set.

One of the biggest surprises on the 2018 list was the ""re-emergence of group exercise programs,"" said Thompson, who remembers ""back in the day when that was all we did.""

Personal training, which was introduced around 2000, reduced the popularity of group training, he noted. However, after the recession, less expensive group training sessions re-emerged and apparently continue to thrive. ""It's got to help increase revenue and decrease expenses,"" Thompson said.

Another trend for 2018 will be older adults being welcomed back into fitness clubs.

Most gyms ""still see their greatest revenue source as the 25- to 35-year-old age bracket,"" Thompson said. But the ""really smart clubs"" are changing music and lighting during slower times when the typical gym-goer is at work, ""so that now, the 60-year-old feels comfortable going into the gym,"" he said. ""It makes total sense.""

Finally, yoga remains in the top 10, where it has been since the survey started, Thompson said. ""Yoga keeps reinventing itself."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120113151442-workout-too-much-exercise-woman-weight-lift-super-tease.jpg

There is no such thing as ""spot reducing"" when it comes to fat loss

(CNN) If you ask almost any fitness professional how to lose your love handles, they will tell you two things: No amount of abdominal crunches will make a difference if you don't first improve your diet and exercise regimen.

And there is no such thing as ""spot reducing"" when it comes to fat loss, so you can't target this area alone.

Love handles, the pinchable fat on both sides of your stomach that leads to a ""muffin top"" appearance, are especially stubborn. They do not respond as quickly to diet and exercise changes as the more dangerous visceral fat that is deep within your abdomen and leads to more of a ""potbelly"" appearance.

If you are a woman and your waist is larger than 35 inches around or a man with a waist size greater than 40 inches, you will lose the deep belly fat first. This is actually better for your health, as visceral fat has been linked to numerous medical issues, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, pre-diabetes and inflammation.

To lose the subcutaneous fat that forms not-so-lovable love handles (or excess fat on your hips, thighs and buttocks), it's going to take even more time and effort.

fd5c62231ad74b2c92202b50cc8b0bf5	['Daniella Emanuel']	2017-07-26 00:00:00	Why intense workouts are leading to a life-threatening condition	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Why intense workouts are leading to a life-threatening condition	1	"(CNN) When Christopher Michael Everett went to his first SoulCycle class, he gave it his all. He sat in the front of the class, cranked the resistance on his bike and started pedaling.

Within the first five to 10 minutes, his thighs began to hurt and feel abnormal. But he powered through the pain and stuck it out until the end of the class.

""They say go big or go home. I probably should have went home,"" said Everett, a 33-year-old actor in Los Angeles.

For the rest of the day, he felt OK, but the following night was marred by excruciating thigh pain. Unable to sleep, he searched for ""Spin class and sore legs"" and came across a personal account written by a woman who needed to go to the hospital after a cycling class for a condition called rhabdomyolysis.

Rhabdomyolysis leads muscle tissue to break down and release a harmful protein into the bloodstream. Everett recognized the symptoms she mentioned, such as soreness, swollen thighs, nausea and an inability to bend the knees. He had all of them except dark brown urine , which he was not about to wait for, he said.

Everett immediately went to the ER and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. He stayed in the hospital for a week.

What is rhabdomyolysis?

Rhabdomyolysis quite literally means ""breakdown of muscle,"" said Dr. Derek Fine, associate professor of medicine and interim chief of nephrology at Johns Hopkins Medicine. When the muscle breaks down, it releases myoglobin, a protein that can poison the kidneys, into the bloodstream.

The condition is caused by any type of trauma to the muscle. There are also toxins in some medications and illicit drugs that can cause it, he said. The first descriptions of the condition were among people who had been trapped under bombed buildings during World War II, Fine said.

Recently, strenuous exercise has been popping up as another common culprit, seen in people who do activities like Spinning, P90X, CrossFit, weightlifting and running.

""I've had patients come in who can't walk. They can't get out of bed. They call 911 because their muscles don't work,"" Fine said.

In rhabdomyolysis cases that are easier to treat, the patient is given fluids to rehydrate and released from the hospital after a few days of monitoring, Fine said.

Everett said he was hooked up to an IV and pumped with fluids for seven days to flush out the toxins in his kidneys. He was not released until his levels of CPK -- creatine phosphokinase, an enzyme that leaks into the blood when muscle tissue is damaged -- were normal.

Worst-case scenario

If the condition is really severe, the kidneys may shut down, and the patient could end up on dialysis. With kidney failure comes the risk of an overload of potassium in the body, which could lead to abnormal heart rhythms and death.

In April, the American Journal of Medicine released a study on three cases of rhabdomyolysis that were caused by Spinning classes. In one case, a 33-year-old kindergarten teacher was put on dialysis when she had kidney failure and experienced fluid overload from her hydration treatment.

""It's tough to tell somebody who's 33 years old, 'I need to start you on dialysis.' And so you treat them with a lot of fluids, and you hopefully get them to the point where their kidneys open up and they start getting rid of the toxins and they don't have to go on dialysis,"" said Dr. Alan Coffino, a nephrologist and chairman of medicine at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York and a co-author of the study. He treated the 33-year-old. ""In her case, we had to pull the plug and put her on dialysis.""

After two weeks, her kidneys opened up, and she was released from the hospital.

Another potential symptom of rhabdomyolysis is compartment syndrome, Coffino said, which is when muscles swell and are unable to expand. In some cases, surgery is needed to release pressure from the muscle.

Everett said the swelling of his thighs concerned the doctor. ""He was like, 'if your thighs get any more swollen, we're going to have to cut those open,' "" he said. But the swelling did not increase, and Everett was able to avoid surgery.

How to avoid rhabdomyolysis

People who work out regularly can get rhabdomyolysis, Coffino said, as well as those who don't exercise often. Those who are fit typically get it if they push themselves too hard or if they try a new exercise that works a different muscle group. The study he co-authored points out that of the 46 people documented in medical literature who got rhabdomyolysis from a Spin class, 42 developed it after their first class.

Everett worked out every two to three days and considers himself fit, but he had never taken a Spin class before.

""I just wish SoulCycle would have said at the beginning of the class, 'if you work out too hard, this can happen to you,' "" Everett said. Its been one month since he was hospitalized, and his legs are still sore.

SoulCycle has not responded to requests for comment.

Although any type of extreme exercise can lead to the condition, the popularity of Spinning is what concerns Dr. Maureen Brogan, associate professor of medicine at New York Medical College, nephrologist at Westchester Medical Center and the lead author of the study.

""I mean, Spinning, you burn 600 calories in an hour, and you lose up to a liter an hour of sweat,"" Brogan said. ""Six hundred calories is like running six miles. So if you're not conditioned, you wouldn't just run six miles.""

One of her patients developed rhabdomyolysis after spending only 15 minutes on a bike.

Rhabdomyolysis can occur at any age and in both men and women. In Brogan's Spinning study, it was more common in females, but that's because more women tend to participate in the exercise, she said.

To avoid the condition, it is important to be slow and gradual when beginning a new type of workout, she said. When going to a class, you should tell the instructor if you are new, and make sure to hydrate before, during and after exercising.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be damaging to the kidneys, so they shouldn't be taken after an intense workout, Brogan said. If someone does develop rhabdomyolysis, it could worsen their condition.

""It's better just to err on the side of caution and take things slowly,"" Brogan said."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170719161858-04-rhabdomyolysis-spin-class-explainer-super-tease.jpg
50a2e2d77f8648bcaf6e7253abbe682f	['Amy Chillag', 'Cnn Special Projects']	2017-12-26 00:00:00	How an overweight shelter dog saved Eric O'Grey's life	https://www.cnn.com/	US	How an overweight shelter dog saved Eric O'Grey's life	1	"(CNN) Life as a 340-pound man had become unmanageable for Eric O'Grey.

When he wasn't traveling for work as a salesman for GE, the 51-year-old rarely left his San Jose, California, apartment.

He took insulin for type 2 diabetes and about 15 other medications, including anti-depressants and weight-loss drugs.

""My entire life was an exercise in minimizing my movement. I just felt miserable all the time,"" O'Grey told CNN. ""It's just amazing how painful it is to be that heavy. Every part of your body hurts. My cholesterol was 400, which is the walking dead level.""

Eric O'Grey in 2010, before he lost more than 150 pounds.

He tried dieting, but nothing worked. Then two things happened seven years ago that inspired him to go see a naturopathic doctor

O'Grey had an embarrassing incident on a plane when the flight crew had to wait for a seat belt extension for him before taking off. And he saw former President Bill Clinton on the news talking about his new ""plant-based"" diet.

The doctor recommended a whole foods, plant-based diet like Clinton's. She told O'Grey to throw out everything in his pantry that wasn't on her list.

But she also said something that shocked him. She ordered him to adopt a shelter dog and walk him twice a day for 30 minutes.

""I said, 'Why a dog? Can I adopt a cat instead?' She said, 'Have you ever walked a cat?'""

Meeting Peety

Eric went home armed with new recipes and an order to visit his local animal shelter.

He went to the shelter with visions of the perfect dog dancing through his head, one that never barked or shed or disobeyed commands.

And then the adoption coordinator brought in an obese dog with skin problems.

Eric O'Grey with Peety, the shelter dog he adopted.

""His head was hung low and he wasn't even looking up. He was just obviously depressed,"" O'Grey said. ""The dog looked up at me with a clear sense of disappointment I'd never seen on any person or creature.""

The adoption coordinator told him they had a lot in common and both needed to work on the same things.

""'You told me you want to lose weight and get outside more,"" she said. ""This dog needs the same thing. So this is the dog that I am recommending for you.""

O'Grey took the dog home and named him ""Peety"" after the pup in ""The Little Rascals."" And they began going on walks.

A bond is formed

At first, O'Grey could only take his new sidekick about 100 yards before he'd turn back, huffing and puffing and embarrassed.

But Peety seemed to like it.

""He just looked up at me like he was so appreciative.""

Their twice-daily walks gradually got longer as Eric began to enjoy his strolls through a neighborhood he'd never explored on foot before.

And Peety, with his striking white and black markings, was a great conversation starter.

""I called him my weapon of mass seduction because everybody wanted to meet him,"" O'Grey said. ""We would walk around town and these women would say, 'Hey, do you mind if I pet your dog?'""

As they lost weight and grew healthier together, the pair developed a tight bond.

""I decided to become the person who he thought that I was. And over time really every part of my life improved,"" O'Grey said. ""I was so reclusive and removed from society at the time that I needed a relationship in my life.

""It turned on certain emotions in me that I'd never really felt before.""

From couch potato to marathoner

In less than six months, Eric quit all the medications he was taking.

He barely knew how to boil water, but he learned how to cook the spicy, vegetarian recipes his naturopathic doctor gave him.

""I really began liking my new foods much better than my old foods,"" he said. ""My palate changed entirely and I started craving spicy foods.""

And in 10 months, he dropped from 340 pounds to 185 pounds.

Eric began going on dates for the first time in 15 years. He had so much extra energy with his leaner body and healthier diet that he joined a club of runners.

""I was bouncing off the walls, I just had more energy than I could handle,"" he said.

Over time O'Grey discovered that he loved long-distance running. Today he runs an average of five to six marathons a year.

But he's quick to emphasize that his weight loss didn't come from running. Healthy eating and two walks a day with Peety did that.

In March 2015, Peety died of cancer. O'Grey calls it the ""the saddest day of my life.""

A new exercise buddy

Today O'Grey lives in Boise, Idaho, where he cooks up dishes like vegetarian paella with purple carrots and marinated tofu. His kitchen has large bins of exotic spices.

He is an evangelist for three things: cooking with fresh veggies and lots of spices, long-distance running and dog adoption.

Five months after Peety died, he found solace by adopting a new exercise buddy. Jake, with his shiny black coat, lean frame and boundless energy, is a good match for the new, healthy Eric.

Eric O'Grey and Jake, the dog he adopted after Peety died.

Last year O'Grey rekindled a relationship with his high school sweetheart and got married.

It's been seven years since he started his journey toward a healthier, happier life. He is 58 years old but he says he feels more like 25.

And for others struggling with obesity, Eric offers this encouragement.

de3b754f7e5e4eb48e1888b9a0456611	['Ruben Meerman', 'Andrew Brown', 'The Conversation']	2018-03-26 00:00:00	Where fat goes when you lose weight	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Where fat goes when you lose weight	1	"The world is obsessed with fad diets and weight loss, yet few of us know how a kilogram of fat actually vanishes off the scales.

Even the 150 doctors, dietitians and personal trainers we surveyed shared this surprising gap in their health literacy . The most common misconception by far, was that fat is converted to energy. The problem with this theory is that it violates the law of conservation of matter, which all chemical reactions obey.

Some respondents thought fat turns into muscle, which is impossible, and others assumed it escapes via the colon. Only three of our respondents gave the right answer, which means 98% of the health professionals in our survey could not explain how weight loss works.

So if not energy, muscles or the loo, where does fat go?

The enlightening facts about fat metabolism

The correct answer is that fat is converted to carbon dioxide and water. You exhale the carbon dioxide and the water mixes into your circulation until it's lost as urine or sweat.

If you lose 10 pounds of fat, precisely 8.4 pounds comes out through your lungs and the remaining 1.6 pounds turns into water. In other words, nearly all the weight we lose is exhaled.

This surprises just about everyone, but actually, almost everything we eat comes back out via the lungs. Every carbohydrate you digest and nearly all the fats are converted to carbon dioxide and water. The same goes for alcohol.

Protein shares the same fate, except for the small part that turns into urea and other solids, which you excrete as urine.

The only thing in food that makes it to your colon undigested and intact is dietary fibre (think corn). Everything else you swallow is absorbed into your bloodstream and organs and, after that, it's not going anywhere until you've vaporised it.

Kilograms in versus kilograms out

We all learn that ""energy in equals energy out"" in high school. But energy is a notoriously confusing concept, even among health professionals and scientists who study obesity

The reason we gain or lose weight is much less mysterious if we keep track of all the kilograms, too, not just those enigmatic kilojoules or calories.

According to the latest government figures, Americans consume 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and beverages every day. Of that, 430 grams (about 15 ounces) is solid macronutrients , 17 grams (0.6 ounces) is fibre and the remaining 3.11 kg (110 ounces) is water

What's not reported is that we inhale more than 660 grams (23 ounces) worth of oxygen, too, and this figure is equally important for your waistline.

If you put 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and water into your body, plus 660 grams of oxygen (23 ounces), then 4.2 kg (148 ounces) of stuff needs to come back out, or you'll gain weight. If you're hoping to shed some weight, more than 4.1kg will have to go.

The 430 grams (15.2 ounces) of carbohydrates, fats, protein and alcohol most Americans eat every day will produce exactly 770 grams (27.1 ounces) of carbon dioxide plus 290 grams (10.2 ounces) of water (about one cup) and about 31 grams (1.1 ounces) of urea and other solids excreted as urine.

An average 75kg (165 pound) person's resting metabolic rate (the rate at which the body uses energy when the person isn't moving) produces about 590 grams (21 ounces) of carbon dioxide per day. No pill or potion you can buy will increase that figure, despite the bold claims you might have heard.

The good news is that you exhale 200 grams (7 ounces) of carbon dioxide while you're fast asleep every night, so you've already breathed out a quarter of your daily target before you even step out of bed.

Eat less, exhale more

So if fat turns into carbon dioxide, could simply breathing more make you lose weight? Unfortunately not. Huffing and puffing more than you need to is called hyperventilation and will only make you dizzy, or possibly faint. The only way you can consciously increase the amount of carbon dioxide your body is producing is by moving your muscles.

But here's some more good news. Simply standing up and getting dressed more than doubles your metabolic rate. In other words, if you simply tried on all your outfits for 24 hours, you'd exhale more than 1,200 grams (42 ounces) of carbon dioxide.

More realistically, going for a walk triples your metabolic rate, and so will cooking, vacuuming and sweeping

Metabolising 100 ounces of fat consumes 290 ounces of oxygen and produces 280 ounces of carbon dioxide plus 110 ounces of water. The food you eat can't change these figures.

Therefore, to lose 100 ounces of fat, you have to exhale 280 ounces of carbon dioxide on top of what you'll produce by vaporising all your food, no matter what you eat.

Any diet that supplies less ""fuel"" than you burn will do the trick, but with so many misconceptions about how weight loss works, few of us know why."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170410191026-01-apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss-super-tease.jpg

Cooking for others can be viewed as a nurturing act that comes with the benefit of increased happiness

(CNN) We say it before we end a phone call. We type it in our texts. It's the last words we speak before we say good night. ""I love you"" is possibly the most popular three-word phrase in the world, spoken millions of times every day.

""I love you"" translates intimacy between ourselves and others, but the expression is so common that it can lack the meaning it's intended. When saying and hearing it becomes automatic and expected, its power becomes dulled in our brain's limbic system, where we process love.

Psychologist Abraham Maslow created a ""hierarchy of needs"" that ranks what humans are motivated to achieve, with love cited as a basic need after safety, food and shelter. A human's need for love carries a weight within us that isn't always an emotion. It can be an overall warmth, a deep sense of belonging, an underlying connectedness or confirmation of adoration between people.

Still how do we arrive at a loving state?

Researchers from Penn State University found that feeling loved isn't just about saying or hearing ""I love you."" Feeling loved is often conveyed through small gestures. According to a recent study, behavioral expressions trump verbal ones when it comes to transmitting that loving feeling. ""It is possible for people to feel loved in simple, everyday scenarios,"" explained the study's lead researcher, Zita Oravecz. ""It doesn't have to be over-the-top gestures.""

1db79b19cfb349efae3b4b8ed37481f4	['Michael Nedelman']	2017-11-03 00:00:00	How some 'Biggest Losers' keep the weight off	https://www.cnn.com/	US	How some 'Biggest Losers' keep the weight off	1	"(CNN) After competing in ""The Biggest Loser,"" many of the reality-show contestants have reluctantly regained the weight they sought to lose through extreme dieting and exercise.

""The truth is, I kind of spiraled,"" Ali Vincent, the first woman to win the competition, told Oprah last year. ""I got home and I was like, 'What do I do?'

""I'm supposed to be strong. I'm supposed to know how to do this.""

But some contestants discovered for themselves the key to keeping their weight down long after the cameras turned off, according to a study published Monday.

Six years after appearing on the show, a group of 14 contestants had kept off a median 13% of their original body weight. The researchers split the group in two -- the ""maintainers,"" who had kept a substantial amount of the weight off, and the ""regainers,"" who did not -- and looked at what set them apart.

""Did they cut more calories from their diet ... or did they become more physically active?"" asked study author Kevin Hall , a senior investigator with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Hall had been ""puzzled by how quickly the contestants were losing weight."" So he contacted the show's physician and began studying the season eight contestants.

Early on, Hall observed that weight loss was better predicted by food intake, not physical activity alone. But in the long term, the opposite was true.

""You have to be very physically active in order to keep the weight off,"" Hall said.

The ""maintainers,"" who kept off about 25% of their preshow weight on average, increased their physical activity by roughly 160% from before the competition. Those who regained the weight increased their activity only 34%. They were 1.1% heavier on average than their original weight.

The researchers couldn't find any major differences between the food intake of both groups; both cut their calories by about the same amount.

""While we know that the most important aspect of helping one lose weight is the dietary intake, that is pretty much reversed when it comes to weight loss maintenance,"" said Dr. Jennifer Kraschnewski , associate professor of medicine and public health sciences at the Penn State College of Medicine. She was not involved in the study.

Hall's findings echo previous studies that promote more exercise for long-term weight loss maintenance. However, experts caution that doesn't mean people can neglect their diets in the long run, either.

To maintain the weight loss, Hall's team estimated that contestants would need to engage in 80 minutes of moderate activity or 35 minutes of vigorous activity each day beyond what they were doing at baseline.

The researchers didn't observe the contestants working out directly. They used tools like traceable water molecules to figure out how much energy was expended -- the ""gold standard"" measurements in this type of research, Kraschnewski said. Many larger studies have instead asked people to self-report how much they exercised, which can be riddled with errors.

This method, however, was not able to tell how much of the physical activity was due to normal daily activities -- like cleaning the house or walking the dog -- versus following a workout plan, Hall said.

Part of the reason the contestants' weight rebounded was because of ""metabolic slowing,"" Hall said. As contestants lost weight during the competition, their bodies burned fewer calories than expected.

""This can make it more difficult to lose weight and is another hurdle to overcome,"" Kraschnewski said. After going on a very low-calorie diet, ""the body's mechanisms kick in to preserve body mass at all costs.""

Six years later, however, the contestants' resting metabolisms still hadn't sped back up, Hall showed in a study last year.

This is a stark difference from people who have had gastric bypass surgery for weight loss, whose metabolisms may speed back up in a year's time, Kraschnewski said. Researchers are trying to figure out why this is -- and it may have something to do with the intricate connections between the gut, brain and hormones that regulate hunger, Kraschnewski added.

For Hall, metabolic changes are just one part of the puzzle. Genetics may also play a role, as well as social factors that can make it hard for some people to incorporate so much exercise in their daily lives.

""To do that requires a huge investment of time and energy,"" he said. ""The bar is set very high for those folks to be able to maintain the weight loss without surgery or drugs.""

Hall added that it's not necessarily those who were most physically active during the competition who kept it up six years later.

""You can't really reproduce the expectation that those individuals must have had on the show to lose weight -- the pressure,"" Kraschnewski said.

""The take-home point here is that obesity really is a disease,"" she said. ""It's not something that you can treat once and will cure it. It's something that has to be continually addressed in one's life."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160427123354-biggest-loser-winners-roberto-hernandez-super-tease.jpg
0c016c48e23d4d9e95c963f0aab0a1d8	['Ian Kerner']	2017-07-26 00:00:00	When is it really time for couples therapy?	https://www.cnn.com/	US	When is it really time for couples therapy?	1	"(CNN) I'm often asked when couples should consider therapy. It's common for one partner to be unhappy, feel disconnected or feel that their needs for intimacy aren't being met.

But rather than communicate about it, that partner may open up a metaphorical window with someone else and begin an affair. By the time the couple comes to therapy, the affair itself becomes the main topic, and its underlying causes are often ignored.

The same scenario rings true for other sources of contention, from financial disagreements to sexual concerns. It's clear that couples shouldn't wait until they're in crisis mode to come to therapy, but what should they do?

When is the right time to see a therapist?

Couples should seek therapy long before they think they ""need"" to. Most experts believe that therapy can be an important part of your relationship. ""Most issues within a couple start small and then grow in size when they don't get resolved. This is where therapy can help, by giving tools and techniques to improve conflict resolution,"" explained Kristie Overstreet, a licensed mental health counselor. ""The majority of couples that I work with say that they should have started therapy years earlier.""

""There are three sides to every story: his side, her side and the truth,"" psychotherapist Kimberly Resnick Anderson agreed. ""An objective third party can be just the ticket when couples feel they can no longer communicate effectively.""

Rather than viewing therapy as the solution to a crisis, look at it as an integral aspect of a healthy life, suggested Ashley N. Grinonneau-Denton, marriage and family therapist.

""Every couple should take preventive measures to maintain health in their relationship, just like going to the gym,"" she said. ""If couples don't work their relational and emotional 'muscles,' they become un-toned, weak and create more of a chance of damage being done to their relationship.""

What happens during couples therapy?

Although every therapist is different, there are some commonalities. The first session typically involves the therapist getting to know you, discussing the areas of the relationship they hope to improve and setting goals.

Some, but not all, therapists will assign homework for the couples to work on before the next session. ""Ideally, most of the work gets done, in my experience, outside of my office,"" psychotherapist Samantha Manewitz said.

What problems can benefit from therapy?

Couples come to therapy for any number of reasons, but in my experience, in addition to infidelity, the greatest issues include sex, communication, money and major life changes such as getting married or starting a family. Couples therapy is also a good idea if one of you is coping with an issue that might be affecting your relationship (such as depression) or simply if you're feeling stuck and stagnant in your relationship.

Therapy can provide a safe space to talk about sensitive topics such as sex. ""Just like folks can get caught in a negative relational cycle, couples can often also get stuck in a negative sexual cycle,"" said Michael Moran, a certified sex therapist. ""I tell couples that when the sex they're having is worth having, they'll have more of it. And so we need to explore what blocks exist to creating that place between them.""

Communication is also a big concern for couples. But simply talking with each other more isn't the answer. ""There is communication, and then there's effective communication,"" explained Sara Nasserzadeh, a psychologist. ""Both parties need to feel heard, soothed, respected and cared for first. We analyze old communication patterns and then replace them with feasible and more effective ones. These are all worked out collaboratively with the couple and within the context of their everyday life.""

You might also consider couples therapy to help support you at times of major life change and transition. ""Getting married, becoming parents for the first time, moving, changing jobs, losing jobs, becoming empty-nesters, coping after extramarital affairs, recovering from addiction, caring for aging parents -- all of these transitions can destabilize a couple's equilibrium,"" Anderson said. ""Therapy affords couples an opportunity to negotiate these transitions with as little disruption as possible and to explore and honor what a particular transition means to each partner.""

And don't discount the value of couples therapy in helping you and your partner dig yourselves out of a rut.

""Therapy allows couples to talk through their feelings and articulate how their relationship may not be meeting their expectations,"" said James C. Wadley, a licensed counselor. ""More often than not, there is some common ground that may have enabled them to be in the relationship. 'Feeling stuck' can shift if both parties are willing to compromise in a way so that individual needs are met.""

What if one partner refuses to go?

This is a fairly common scenario in couples therapy. How you approach it can make a difference. ""Talk with your partner extensively about why you're feeling you'd like to get into couples therapy,"" Moran said. ""Don't just spring it on them and insist they go.""

If they're still hesitant, remember that you can attend therapy on your own. This alone may have a beneficial effect.

""Instead of waiting for the other person who doesn't want to go to therapy to change, therapy can help strengthen your own self-improvement and personal growth,"" said Marissa Nelson, a marriage and family therapist. The hesitant partner may become impressed by these positive changes and decide to pursue therapy after all.

If you think your own experiences with therapy have piqued your partner's curiosity, let them know that can see the therapist individually as well. ""Often, by letting them know a safety zone will be created, where their voice is heard and fault or blame isn't the goal, the hesitant partner might feel safe to come in,"" psychotherapist Constance DelGiudice explained.

How do you know if your therapist is a good fit?

It helps to do your research before choosing a couples therapist, but the truth is that you won't really know whether they're the right for you and your partner until you get together.

""I often arrange a phone call first with clients to make sure we are potentially a good fit,"" Nasserzadeh said. ""Once you meet, pay attention to the therapist's communication style, the rational behind their questions and their general approach. ""Any homework they assign should be explained clearly and makes sense to you and your line of logic.""

How long should therapy last?

There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. It really depends on the couple and the issues they're working through. For some couples, a few sessions may be all they need to jump-start their relationship, while others may remain in therapy for years.

In general, it's a good idea to see a therapist together until you've met your goals and feel confident that you've gained the skills necessary to navigate the ups and downs of your relationship."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150218151357-couple-date-stock-super-169.jpg
9bf83816224f4aecb062865e392df89e	['Meera Senthilingam', 'Jessie Yeung']	2018-05-22 00:00:00	Leukemia: Could germ-free childhoods could trigger illness?	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Leukemia: Could germ-free childhoods could trigger illness?	1	"(CNN) Germ-free childhoods followed by infections later in life can trigger the onset of childhood leukemia, a new study suggests.

The first step is a genetic mutation before birth that predisposes a child to the risk of developing this form of leukemia. The second step is exposure to certain infections later in childhood, after clean early childhoods that limited exposure to infections.

More specifically, children who grew up in cleaner households during their first year and interacted less with other children are more likely to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the paper says.

The author, Institute of Cancer Research Professor Mel Greaves, suggests the cancer could be preventable.

Greaves reviewed more than 30 years of research, including his own, on the genetics, cell biology, immunology, epidemiology and animal modeling of childhood leukemia and reached this conclusion. Greaves said he had long wondered ""why or how otherwise healthy children develop leukaemia and whether this cancer is preventable.""

""This body of research is a culmination of decades of work, and at last provides a credible explanation for how the major type of childhood leukaemia develops,"" he said in a statement. ""The research strongly suggests that (this cancer) has a clear biological cause, and is triggered by a variety of infections in predisposed children whose immune systems have not been properly primed.""

However, other experts warn that more specifics needs to be confirmed and emphasize that hygiene and safety are still crucial.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia , known as ALL, is a form of blood cancer that is most often diagnosed in children ages zero to 4 years old, though older children and adults can also be diagnosed. It develops quickly, over days or weeks, building up in the blood and spreads to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver and nervous system. The main form of treatment is chemotherapy.

Rates of the disease are increasing globally. One study estimated there were 53,000 cases worldwide in 2016. Around 5,960 new cases of ALL are estimated to occur in the United States in 2018, with 1,470 deaths according to the American Cancer Society. Each year, around 810 people are diagnosed in the UK , according to Cancer Research UK.

While a genetic mutation plays a role in predisposing someone to the disease, just 1% of children born with this mutation go on to develop the disease, according to the paper. Rates are more common in advanced, affluent societies, which suggests the second step could be caused by factors relating to modern life.

Previous claims have linked electromagnetic waves and other environmental factors to the disease, but Greaves dismissed this link in his paper.

The body of research ""busts some persistent myths about the causes of leukaemia, such as the damaging but unsubstantiated claims that the disease is commonly caused by exposure to electro-magnetic waves or pollution,"" said Greaves.

Greaves instead believes that when a baby is exposed to infections during its first year, its immune system is strengthened. But later infections, without the initial priming, can trigger leukemia in those with the genetic mutation.

Population studies have found that early exposure to infection in infancy such as day care attendance and breastfeeding can protect against ALL, probably by priming the immune system, according to the study.

Greaves emphasized that infection as a cause applies only to ALL. Other types of leukemia, including infant leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, probably have different causal mechanisms.

""Preventing childhood leukaemia would have a huge impact on the lives of children and their families in the UK and across the globe,"" said Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, London.

However, other experts are more cautiously hopeful, emphasizing that genetics and pure chance are still significant factors for developing ALL.

""If we could stop this type of leukaemia from happening in the first place it would be enormously exciting, but many more questions still need to be answered in the research lab before we will know for sure whether that could become a reality,"" said Alasdair Rankin, director of research at blood cancer charity Bloodwise.

""There is no proven link yet with a specific infection,"" said Dr. Donna Lancaster, consultant pediatric oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. ""This [new study] still needs further investigation and any exposure of young children to infection has to be balanced with the risk of the infection.

Sheena Cruickshank of the British Society for Immunology also pointed to the potential risk of exposing children to infections, emphasizing that hygiene and safety are still crucial to maintain.

""It's also important to remember that infections themselves can pose a significant risk for young babies with a developing immune system,"" said Cruickshank in a statement. ""Parents should not be unduly alarmed by this review.""

The research may be a step toward developing preventative measures. However, Charles Swanton, chief clinician of Cancer Research UK, stressed that the causes and prevention methods are still unconfirmed.

""This research sheds light on how a form of childhood blood cancer might develop, implicating a complex combination of genetics and early exposure to germs, dirt, and illness,"" Swanton said. ""We want to assure any parents of a child who has or has had leukaemia, that there's nothing that we know of that could have been done to prevent their illness."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180522071054-nursery-room-stock-super-tease.jpg
7a75b788ef0049f3930363863d69701a	['Kelly Wallace']	2018-05-21 00:00:00	5 ways to help girls be more confident	https://www.cnn.com/	US	5 ways to help girls be more confident	1	"(CNN) If there's one quality I want my girls to have more than any other, it is confidence.

I've seen how important it is in the workplace and in life: Confident people get what they want. They take risks. They are not afraid of failure.

Growing up as a perfectionist, somewhat fearful of both failure and success, I wish I had the confidence in my teens and early 20s that I have now.

For all these reasons, I was thrilled when one of my daughters, during the first grade, had to name five words to describe herself. Confident was on her list. I thought then and still think now, ""What can I do to make sure she feels that way when she is a teenager?""

Journalist, author and speaker Claire Shipman has some answers. In 2014, she and her co-author, Katty Kay, anchor of BBC World News America, published ""The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance -- What Women Should Know."" The book resonated deeply with women and quickly became a bestseller.

As Shipman and Kay traveled the country to speak about the book, one of the most common questions they would get was from parents, women and men, who were concerned about their daughters.

"" 'What about my daughter? I see this in my daughter,' "" Shipman said they would say. ""It was just this huge focus on young women and girls. 'What can I be doing with my girls, because I already see she's not this. She's experiencing that.' ""

Shipman, who spent a decade at CNN as a White House and international correspondent in the 1990s, said she and Kay did some research and found that there were plenty of books on the topic for parents but not as many specifically written for girls. So they decided to write one for girls in middle school, although it is applicable for girls up through high school, Shipman says.

They also commissioned an online poll, which backs up what other research has shown.

Between the ages of 8 and 14, girls' confidence drops by 30%, according to the survey of nearly 1,400 8- to 18-year-olds and their parents and guardians . The survey also found that three out of four teen girls worry about failing,

""We were surprised at how quickly, how deep that drop is,"" Shipman said. ""And especially because right until age 8, there's really no difference in confidence levels.""

So how do we stop this troubling trend?

I asked Shipman, a mom of two, for some advice -- advice she said she's using with her 13-year-old daughter, with good results.

1. Help her get outside her comfort zone and take risks.

One of the most important things we can do as parents of daughters, Shipman said, is to help them get ""comfortable being uncomfortable."" Shipman said she and Kay feel that if they do nothing else in this book but get girls to walk away and understand that it's cool to take risks, they will have succeeded.

As for how to do that, a parent can talk to their daughter about how they approach a risk and some of the ways they can support themselves. ""It's kind of counterintuitive, but just telling yourself 'Oh, you shouldn't be afraid of this' or 'there's nothing scary about it' or 'fake it until you make it,' that doesn't actually help. Risks can be scary,"" Shipman said.

So encourage your daughter and tell her, ""Yes, it's normal to feel afraid. This is a little frightening, but tell yourself 'I'm just going to do it afraid. I'm just going to do it anyway,' "" Shipman said.

2. Have her keep a list of risks.

Having your daughter keep a list of the risks she has taken and how she worked through them can be a reminder of what she is capable of, Shipman said. The same holds true for failures: Listing their failures and how they tackled them can be incredibly empowering.

Also, have them keep a list of some stock phrases that they can tell themselves when they are in a bit of a frightening situation, such as ""I've done something like this before. I can do it. I've got it.""

3. Remind her of 'failure fixes.'

Our girls need to know that failure will undoubtedly happen and that it's not something they can avoid. But knowing how to deal with it can help. ""We all need a cheat sheet to failure,"" Shipman and Kay write.

They offer a list of 10 ""failure fixes"" such as ""change the channel."" Encourage your daughter to do anything that helps her get in a better place, whether that is reading a book, watching TV, listening to music or cuddling with a family pet. This will help distract her from what's happened and help her stop thinking about it over and over again.

Another fix is putting it in perspective. Shipman talks about an idea she and Kay heard from a middle school counselor, which she called a ""virtual hot air balloon ride."" Help your daughter envision herself up in the sky with the clouds and looking down at the situation that happened. ""First, that lets her kind of literally put it in perspective, like, 'Wow, look, other things are going on,' and then see it from a different angle and talk about it that way.""

Trying to keep a sense of humor is also key. Of course, this is not easy when your daughter is melting down after what she considers the biggest failure of her life. But try to help her see that it could be much worse. ""Thoughts like 'at least I didn't forget to put on pants and go to school naked after our roof caved in' ... can remind you that it really could be worse!"" they write.

4. Role model failure and struggle.

One of the more surprising results (at least to me) from the poll Shipman and Kay commissioned is that fathers seem to be better at recognizing a lack of confidence in their daughters than mothers: They were found to be 26% more likely to accurately estimate their child's confidence than moms were.

How could that be? Aren't mothers supposed to be the more intuitive parents? But as Shipman did her research, she found that mothers perhaps don't see their daughters' behavior as unusual.

""Perfectionism or worry about this or that, or sort of reticence to raise your hand, that's recognizable to us,"" Shipman said. ""Even if instinctively we know it's wrong, it doesn't seem odd, because we've probably experienced it. We may still do it, whereas I think fathers, who do have incredibly high expectations for their daughters, would be (saying) 'What is going on with my 9-year-old? Why was she this way a year ago, and now she's thinking she can't do anything?' They find it genuinely strange.""

The takeaway is how influential role modeling can be for our kids. Let them see us, especially mothers, dealing with failure and struggle and taking risks.

""If we're going on, 'I'm so worried about this. I have to get it right,' it doesn't help them,"" Shipman said. She's tried to take this advice even more with her teenage daughter and ""lift the veil a little bit.""

When she's upset about something, for instance, such as having to rewrite a few chapters for a book, she lets her daughter see how she's feeling and then raises the question whether she's overreacting and figures out how she's going to deal with it -- all in front of her daughter.

5. Remind her she doesn't have a problem.

With all the talk about girls and confidence, it's important to make it clear to our girls that it's not like they have a problem that needs to be fixed, Shipman said. Girls are the way they are for a host of reasons, including nature (brain biology) and nurture (society's different expectations for girls and boys.) They also often have a higher level of emotional intelligence.

""It's not like we want to churn out a bunch of girls who operate like boys,"" Shipman said. ""I think it would be wonderful for young women to understand much earlier on, essentially, the world doesn't operate like school.""

Helping girls understand at young ages what skills will be important later in life is key, including the ability to advocate for themselves and not worry about being people pleasers, Shipman said.

""Girls, even when they speak up in class or whatever it is, they want to please people, so I feel like the next hurdle is for girls to understand that they will not always please people. People won't always like them,"" Shipman said. ""And when they speak up, some people will like what they say, and others won't, and how do they develop that armor so that they say 'but that's OK, because I'm me.'

acd697524ccb4d42a42a506973db61e4	['Kelly Wallace']	2018-05-03 00:00:00	Move over, 'sit still'! Why kids need to move in school	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Move over, 'sit still'! Why kids need to move in school	1	"(CNN) A few years ago, when my girls were in the second and third grades, they raved about the dance breaks they would occasionally have during the school day.

Their teachers would put on a video, which encouraged the kids to get up and dance, and then they'd get back to work.

""What a brilliant idea,"" I remember thinking at the time.

My kids' teachers were certainly not alone. More teachers are incorporating some form of movement into the school day, especially as the research is pretty clear: Physical activity in school leads to better cognitive performance and fewer behavioral issues, not to mention cutting down on stress and anxiety.

Groups such as the National Association of Physical Literacy tout the importance of teaching kids to move while they're young so that they will make movement part of their lives when they grow up.

It all seems like a no-brainer, especially as research shows that childhood obesity seems to be getting worse . As former first lady Michelle Obama advocated, let's get our kids to move.

The challenge, though, is persuading school administrations to consistently make time for physical activity when they are pressed to meet stringent academic requirements and find the money to pay for some of the training.

Research: Physical activity benefits students

Just as our schools teach math literacy and reading literacy, they can teach physical literacy, teaching children the basics of movement so that they can stay active for life, said Susan Kamin, chief wellness officer for the National Association of Physical Literacy.

The for-profit association provides in-person and online training to teachers and communities and provides ""BrainErgizer"" videos, five-minute movement videos developed in conjunction with the University of Connecticut based on research on what stimulates the brain.

Dr. John Ratey , an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, says activity breaks during the school day create better learners because of the impact of movement on the brain.

""When you move, you stimulate all the nerve cells that we use to think with, and when you stimulate those nerve cells, it gets them ready to do stuff,"" said Ratey, an expert in neuropsychiatry and author of ""Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain"" who has spent the past 30 years focusing on the ""attention systems"" of the brain.

""When you exercise, you turn on the attention systems, so that means you're (paying) better attention, you're able to deal with more frustration, you're able to stay with it longer,"" he said. ""You're able to manipulate information by turning ... on the front part of our brain to make it work better, and that's really key and important in terms of taking in information as well as performing with it.""

A recent study, a review of 26 previous studies looking at the impact of physical activity on academic performance, found that kids who get extra physical activity in school do better in reading and math.

The study, published in the journal Pediatrics , involved more than 10,000 children between the ages of 4 and 13. It found that physical activity, especially physical education, improves behavior in classrooms and is a boost to academic achievement, especially math-related skills and reading.

""The research shows that it leads to better cognitive function for kids so they're going to have better results, academically,"" Kamin said. ""It's also going to help with behavioral issues in the classroom, because if kids are able to move, they're not going to have so much excess energy. They're going to be able to focus, and it's going to solve a lot of the sort of interpersonal issues that come up with kids as well, because they're going to have an opportunity to get that energy out.""

Breakthrough Magnet School, South, a pre-K through eighth-grade school in Hartford, Connecticut, is in its third year working with the National Association of Physical Literacy. The school had valued movement and mindfulness before, but since the partnership, the school has received additional training and is making physical literacy a key part of the classroom experience, Principal Julie Goldstein said.

""I think it really validates a lot of what teachers know: that students need movement, they need planned opportunities for movement and that it can be done in a pretty short, simple way throughout the day and that the benefits of it outweigh the little bit of planning that is necessary in the beginning to kind of get that structured,"" Goldstein said.

Her third- and fourth-graders who are actively engaged in physical literacy are the highest-scoring students in math and literacy within the district, she said. Beyond the benefits academically, there are benefits outside the classroom. For this school year, not one student from this group has been referred to her office for a conversation with the principal. Before they started doing physical literacy, she might have had one or two office referrals every month, she said.

""This particular grade level is at the highest risk for misunderstandings, disagreements and even injuries at recess time, and we've had none, so the impact that it is has goes far beyond just the academic and the behaviors in the classroom,"" she said. ""Even during the unstructured times, they're better able to manage themselves, to play independently and to do that in a way so that the recess time actually serves them the way it's intended to, which is to give them time to play and have fun.""

Using screens to get kids moving

Four out of five elementary schools in the United States are using videos from the education company GoNoodle to promote physical activity in the classroom, the company says.

The concept is simple: Today's kids have grown up with screens, so GoNoodle tries to use entertaining videos, often about two minutes in length, that will get kids to move around and then either get back to their schoolwork or go off and play with friends.

KC Estenson is the chief executive officer of GoNoodle, a for-profit company that makes money through relationships with partners who believe in the company's mission. (The videos are free for schools and parents, although teachers can pay for GoNoodle+, which for $10 a month gives them access to additional videos, games and classroom resources.)

Estenson -- who is the former head of CNN Digital -- is a father of three who, like most parents, has struggled with how much time his kids, ages 8, 12 and 14, spend on screens during the day.

""GoNoodle gets kids to move. It gets them to be active,"" Estenson said. ""The entire purpose of this is a whole new interaction form with the screen, which is active engagement versus passive engagement, and most television and most of what's happening with the technology now of all ages is passive, binge viewing, hours spent just watching the screen and doing nothing else.""

The key, he said, is making entertaining content that children (the target group is ages 5 to 12, grades K-6) will enjoy so much that they'll want to get up and dance or do yoga or even some form of meditation and mindfulness.

""And so starting from the earliest age ... we're putting positive associations between the right things that are available to them on these screens and hopefully giving them an awesome alternative to the junk food that's out there,"" said Estenson.

'It really validates ... what teachers know'

Active Schools, which was founded as part of Obama's Let's Move initiative, is a national movement, partnering with nonprofits and for profits to try to make physical education and physical activity a bigger part of the school day.

The goal is at least 60 minutes of activity per day, which is crucial especially since many kids don't get the play time children used to get outside of school decades ago. There are a variety of reasons why, including the widespread use of digital devices and a lack of access to and time for free play.

""One of the biggest pieces of feedback we get from schools in the field is, 'we are very busy places. We appreciate what everyone offers, but it's overwhelming. Can you make it easier for us to know what's available?' "" said Charlene Burgeson, executive director of Active Schools.

Streamlining to make it less cumbersome for schools to learn what resources are available and what programs they can bring to their school is one challenge. The others are money, time and philosophy.

Schools can't always find the funding to pay for formal training, videos and other programs that get kids moving. There is also the pressure of the clock and having enough time to work physical activity in when trying to meet the required academic standards and complete the curriculum.

""I know lots of teachers who say, 'Yeah, I wish I had more time to do this,' "" the National Association of Physical Literacy's Kamin said. Even in schools that can find the time, there is still some opposition because it's a departure from the way things used to be, she said.

""It's a big change for some of the teachers. They're not sure that they want to make that leap. It's sort of 'if it's not broke, why fix it?'

d93ab6e8cf5e496bbdf62cbd14db8be7	['Kelly Wallace']	2018-03-02 00:00:00	Looking at children's programming through a #MeToo lens	https://www.cnn.com/	US	Looking at children's programming through a #MeToo lens	1	"(CNN) We are all familiar with the negative images of girls and women in movies and other media -- and how ubiquitous they are.

From the physical portrayal of women as ultra-thin, super sexy and scantily clad to the sexualized roles they often play, it's enough to make you wish you could put your daughters in a bubble to shield them.

Of course, you can't. Even that ""Prince Charming"" narrative, in which their lives are not complete until they meet the right guy and that guy decides to love them in return, is everywhere.

But what about the positive role models our girls are seeing? Certainly, the #MeToo movement has called attention to the need to create more substantial roles for women of all ages on the big and small screens and to get more women behind the scenes in director and screenwriting roles.

Even before the past six months when women's voices have been heard in ways they haven't been before, there were signs -- exciting signs -- of shifting portrayals of young women, even in children's programming.

Research shows that kids develop stereotypes at early ages. A Common Sense Media analysis of more than 150 articles, interviews and books and other research found that kids between the ages of 7 and 10 start to attribute certain qualities to women and men, such as that women are emotional and men are aggressive.

Let me say that one more time. Between 7 and 10.

Helping young girls and boys during these ages see realistic portraits of girls and boys can have enormous benefits, which brings me to ""Andi Mack,"" Disney Channel's No. 1 show in video on demand. The show just wrapped its second season and has been renewed for a third.

Sofia Wylie, left, and Peyton Elizabeth Lee of ""Andi Mack"" on Disney Channel.

Think about the storyline, which is uncharted territory for mainstream children's programming: The main character, Andi, learns that the person she thought was her older sister for 13 years is actually her mother and that the two people she thought were her parents are actually her grandparents. Andi grapples with these life-changing circumstances with the support of her two best friends: the gender-stereotype-bashing Buffy, who believes she is as strong -- or stronger -- than any of the boys, and Cyrus, who has only recently shared with his friends that he is gay.

My girls, ages 10 and 11, and I watch the show -- together -- every Friday night. We recently had a chance to sit down with the show's creator and three of its stars.

'A girl can do anything a boy can do'

TerrI Minksy, the creator and executive producer of ""Andi Mack,"" wanted to create a show that mothers could watch with their daughters. She said she didn't create the characters with female empowerment in mind but very much was focused on the point of view of the girl, because girlhood is when girls begin to get a sense of their own power or lack thereof.

""There's always this 'you can grow up to be whatever you want,' but we haven't seen a female president in the United States. We don't see female faces when you're looking at anything where decisions are being made,"" said Minsky, who made the pilot with a predominantly female team.

""I just feel like it has to start with the kids as represented in the shows as having the power over their world, and hopefully that translates to people watching it without specifically calling it female power.""

Sofia Wylie plays Buffy, who tries out for and makes the boys' basketball team (she also ends up tutoring the captain of the team). Sofia, 14, believes that her character can serve as an empowering role model to girls who watch.

""I would definitely say Buffy sends a message that a girl can do anything a boy can do and there's really no difference,"" said Sofia, also an accomplished dancer who has performed on stage with Justin Bieber and on ""America's Got Talent.""

Sofia Wylie with her military mom on the show ""Andi Mack.""

""So many people say, 'Oh, yeah, boys are just like stronger,' and when a boy says that, I'm going to contain myself now,"" she says to laughter as she indicates how frustrated that statement makes her feel. ""It's not true. If a woman wants to put their mind to something, they can be just as intelligent and just as strong physically and mentally in every way. They can be even better than a man.""

Even today, in 2018, a woman who is competitive -- especially in the workplace -- may be viewed differently than a man. A man may be considered assertive, a woman aggressive. Sofia says her character tackles that double standard as well.

""People think if you're competitive, that means you're mean,"" she said. ""No, she's competitive for a separate reason, because she's been told that she has to be strong."" In one episode, we learn that Buffy feels she needs to always be strong to help her cope when her mom, who is in the military, is away during months-long deployments.

A story line with #MeToo resonance

One of the recurring storylines that also tackles gender stereotypes head-on is Andi's crush on the handsome, athletic and very popular Jonah Beck. During season one and the first half of season two, Andi is basically obsessed with Jonah. At some point, it appears they may actually be boyfriend and girlfriend in the way 13-year-olds innocently begin relationships. She makes him a bracelet. She beams when she sees him. But he never seems to truly understand Andi and never does for Andi all the things she does for him.

And then, Andi has had enough. With the support of her friends Buffy and Cyrus and her mom, Bex, she finally decides to tell Jonah that she has been obsessed with him and that she can no longer continue doing what she has been doing. It is the moment when, I would argue, many women watching (and many who have experienced #MeToo moments) ask themselves, ""Why didn't I say that when I was in a similar situation?""

"" allowfullscreen>

Lilan Bowden, who plays Bex, Andi's independent and individualistic mother, says she wishes she had ""Andi Mack"" when she was a girl. Instead, the shows she watched all repeated the same story line: The girl has a crush on the boy, the boy finally says he likes her back, and they get together.

""That was the message that I felt like I received over and over again: Just do the nice thing. If you're nice and you keep being nice and you don't stop being nice, eventually, you'll get what you want,"" Bowden said. ""And to have that character to say, 'I was nice, and you didn't appreciate it because you're not nice enough back to me' was huge.""

Lilan Bowden, right, plays Andi's mother on the show ""Andi Mack.""

Minsky said the episode was written more as a natural progression of Andi's character and less in response to the #MeToo movement.

When Andi expresses herself to Jonah, she's the one who is in charge for the first time, said Minsky, who also created ""Lizzie McGuire,"" a live-action and animated series that was also a Disney Channel hit.

""It's always the girl giving and embarrassing herself and putting herself out there and taking chances, and the boy's sitting back, and you don't know how he feels ... and then she finally expresses herself, and he's like 'Oh, wow, I really enjoy that you're obsessed with me,' and I kind of feel, 'yeah, I bet you did.' "" (In another sign of the show's relatable nature, it tackles anxiety when Jonah has a panic attack after Andi tells him she is moving on.)

Peyton Elizabeth Lee, who plays Andi, said she, Sofia and Bowden cheered when they read that episode because it was a sign that Andi was ""finally finding her voice.""

""Because she's just been so caught up in 'Jonah's cute, and he's fun, and he has so many friends, and he's popular, and he's athletic and whatever,' but when it really comes down to it, he wasn't giving her enough credit for everything she was doing for him,"" said Peyton, 13, who has appeared on ABC's ""Scandal"" and ""Shameless"" on Showtime.

""I think she was realizing that she's worth more, so it was a really exciting thing ... where she's saying 'I was obsessed with you,' and it's Andi realizing that she doesn't need him to feel complete.""

Gender equality in media? Long way to go

There is no question that we need to see more realistic and authentic female characters on television and in film.

Research commissioned by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in the Media in 2014 shows how far we need to go. It found that the percentage of female characters in the work force in TV and film was less than 25%, when women make up just about half of the actual work force.

Fictional male judges and lawyers outnumbered female characters in those same roles 13 to 1; the breakdown of men to women was 7.6 to 1 when it came to characters in computer science and engineering.

We know that when you see it, you can be it. In a survey of 1,000 women in the United States and the United Kingdom, conducted by the Davis Institute and J. Walter Thompson and unveiled in 2017, 71% of respondents in the US and 63% in the UK said that if we saw more corporate leader characters who were women, it would make it easier for women to become leaders in the corporate sector.

Sixty-four percent of respondents in the US and the UK said that seeing more female characters as politicians would make it easier for women to succeed in politics.

Bowden, who also regularly performs improv and sketch comedy, hopes shows like ""Andi Mack"" are a marker for what is to come.

When she got to Hollywood and was auditioning, there was a very limited selection of roles for women, she said. ""It's almost like a paying of dues where ... you're pretty much just the eye candy,"" she said. ""I didn't want to be a model. I wanted to be an actor, but there's so many roles that are written for women where they just kind of pigeonhole you into being a model.

""This show is all these dynamic female characters that aren't relying on beauty at all, and that's not an experience I felt like I had when I was first auditioning,"" she said.

With surveys showing that girl confidence dips around puberty , having strong female early-teenage role models who speak truthfully and aren't afraid to stand up for what they believe can only be a positive.

""I think you can take so many things away (from the show) but just being confident in yourself,"" Sofia told my daughters. ""I think that's the best thing about all of our characters is, we're all ourselves.""

Added Peyton, ""A lot of shows showcase if you're just nicer, it all works out. If you're nice, you get friends. You have a boyfriend, but it's just not like that, and you have to find that balance of being nice, but being careful. ... You have to figure out which way you want to go."""	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180301155149-03-childrens-programming-female-empowerment-role-models-super-tease.jpg

""Please don't let your children play football until high school,"" one Hall of Fame player said

(CNN) Several former NFL players called Thursday for an end to tackle football for kids ages 13 and under.

Pro football Hall of Famers Nick Buoniconti and Harry Carson joined four-time Pro Bowl linebacker Phil Villapiano and researchers from Boston University to make the announcement. They're working with the Concussion Legacy Foundation to support a new parent education initiative, Flag Football Under 14, that pushes for no tackle football until the age of 14.

""I beg of you, all parents to please don't let your children play football until high school,"" said Buoniconti, 77, who has been diagnosed with dementia and probable chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease.

""I made the mistake starting tackle football at 9 years old. Now, CTE has taken my life away. Youth tackle football is all risk with no reward.""

Buoniconti helped the Miami Dolphins to three straight Super Bowl appearances, including two wins and an undefeated season in 1972, the only such season in all of NFL history. In November, he said he intended to donate his brain to research."	https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170724181611-cte-found-in-110-of-111-brains-former-nfl-players-super-tease.jpg
