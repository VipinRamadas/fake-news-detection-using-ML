To Musk, putting someone who isn't an astronaut into space is a step toward spreading human life across the universe.

At the event, Musk described the current plans for SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket, or BFR, launch vehicle, which hasn't yet been completed and still requires funding. But when it is ready to fly around the moon, it will have Maezawa on board, he said.

Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa has signed on to be the first private citizen to go into deep space, Elon Musk announced at a SpaceX event on Monday.

""There could be some natural event or man-made event that ends civilization as we know it and life as we know it,"" Musk said. ""It’s important that we try to become a multi-planet civilization, extend life beyond earth, and do so as quickly as we can.""

Maezawa, 47, is the founder of Start Today, a company behind a Japanese fashion retail website, as well as Zozo, which creates custom clothes for customers. He's also a major art collector, famously paying $110.5 million at auction for a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat last year. On Monday, he told the SpaceX crowd that he hopes to use his space flight to promote art.

""I choose to go to the moon with artists,"" said Maezawa, who declined to say how much he was paying SpaceX.

The trip is currently planned for 2023, and Maezawa said he will bring between six and eight artists with him as part of a project he's calling Dear Moon. The artists, who will represent disciplines from music to architecture, will then create a work based on their experience, Maezawa said.

""These masterpieces will inspire the dreamer in all of us,"" he said. ""If you should hear from me, please say yes and accept my invitation.""

Musk acknowledged that the plan may not come to fruition, even with the money already provided by Maezawa toward developing the rocket. The 2023 flight date is a best guess for when it could be ready, he said.

""There's so many uncertainties,"" Musk said. ""This is a ridiculously big rocket. It's got so much advanced technology. It's not 100% certain we succeed in getting this to flight. I think it's pretty likely, but it's not certain.""

Here's How She Responded	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	This Politician Was Called A Murderer For Getting A Late Term Abortion. Here's How She Responded	0	"Senator Janet Rice was brought to angry tears during a debate about abortion in parliament last night.

""And yet Senator Anning and Senator Stoker are willing to stand here in this place and call me a murderer."" @janet_rice speaking passionately on abortions yesterday in the Senate. https://t.co/1ph7S8J19p

The Greens politician terminated her second pregnancy at 21 weeks when she discovered her foetus had spina bifida and anencephaly, a condition that results in death soon after birth.

""Most ... late-term abortions are because there are issues with the development of the foetus, and that was certainly the case for mine, and yet Senator Anning and Senator Stoker are willing to stand here in this place and call me a murderer,"" Rice told the chamber during a debate on abortion.

Supplied A matter of public importance moved by Greens senator Rachel Siewert.

Liberal senator Amanda Stoker had just made a speech condemning proposed legislation to decriminalise abortion in Queensland as ""brutal"" and said that abortions in the second trimester were ""excruciating for the child"".

Senator Fraser Anning, who has moved multiple motions on abortion this year, said abortion was ""state-sanctioned murder"". Rice told the chamber: ""Anybody who wants to look at the facts about late-term abortions will see that a woman having a late-term abortion has gone through a huge thought process, discussion and consideration of whether it's the right thing to do.

""Hearing the contributions from the senators in this place, they are not listening to women. They have their very, very strong religious views that they are imposing on women.""

Rice told BuzzFeed News anti-abortion senators claimed to be worried about the psychological impact of abortion on women — ""and we know the psychological impact is far greater for women denied abortions"" — but they didn't care how their comments would impact the mental health of women who have had abortions. ""If they are concerned about the psychological impact on women, if they are truly listening to women, they would stop making such awful damaging attacks on women like we saw last night,"" she said. ""I know how much impact those words have and my emotion showed in the Senate."" Rice isn't the only politician recently who has found the debate upsetting because of her own experiences. Brisbane mother Melanie McKenzie last week brought a Labor MP to tears when she addressed the parliamentary committee currently looking into Queensland's legislation to decriminalise abortion.

McKenzie runs a not-for-profit organisation Harrison's Little Wings to support women and their families who have received a poor or fatal diagnosis in a pregnancy.

""These parents face perhaps the hardest decision of all when told of a fatal diagnosis of their unborn baby: whether or not to have a late termination,"" McKenzie told the committee. ""This is never a decision taken lightly or without much medical testing, diagnosis and medical advice."" In 2010 McKenzie's fourth son Harrison lived for just 28 hours due to an incurable condition, a diaphragmatic hernia, diagnosed at 20 weeks gestation. ""We chose to continue with our pregnancy,"" she said. ""Harrison was born full term weighing eight pounds 14 ounces."" ""I watched my son who was in obvious pain having to have invasive medical procedures."" McKenzie told the committee how helpless she felt not being able to hold or comfort her son.

arms as he died."" Labor MP Joan Pease became teary when thanking McKenzie for her testimony.

By Piper Blackmun

It’s obvious Trump voters are not quick on the uptake. However, some of them are finally figuring out that Trump, a millionaire trust-fund kid, doesn’t really care about them.

According to comments posted in the “Make America White Again” Facebook group, cracks seem to be forming in the walls of Trump support.

“I’m beginning to doubt if Trump really cares about working-class Southerners and other real Americans,” said LaVerne Short, a Trump supporter from Oxford, Miss. “I don’t think he’s ever driven a pick up truck or gone hunting. He doesn’t sound like one of us.”

Trump has been called “the blue-collar billionaire” because of his plain talk and love of fast food. But he has lived most of his life in cosmopolitan New York and inherited a fortune from his father. He has also cheated working people and expressed disdain for Southerners.

According to Bob Woodward’s book “Fear,” he called Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is from Alabama, a “dumb redneck” and also suggested he was retarded. He also made fun of former wife Marla Maples’ relatives because of their Southern accents.

Politico reported: “If Sessions’ recusal was his original sin, Trump has come to resent him for other reasons, griping to aides and lawmakers that the attorney general doesn’t have the Ivy League pedigree the president prefers, that he can’t stand his Southern accent and that Sessions isn’t a capable defender of the president on television — in part because he ‘talks like he has marbles in his mouth,’ the president has told aides.”

According to the New York Times, new polls shows some working-class whites are beginning to sour on Trump.

“As noted, some of them are catching on. A Quinnipiac poll out this week showed that even among non-college-educated whites — the strongest demographic holdout for Trump — a plurality now say they’d like to see Congress be more of a check on the president. Since his election, he’s down 14 points among the ‘poorly educated’ that Trump once professed to love, a CNN poll found,” said Timothy Egan."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-rally-attendees.jpg

By Brian Wilkins

A white nationalist group has recognized FOX News commentator Tucker Carlson’s nightly rants against people of color.

The National White Alliance has announced that Carlson is a front runner for the Caucasian of the Year award. The award recognizes white people who have taken a strong stance to defend their race, said Alliance President Brian Blanc in a press release.

“Tucker is getting a lot of votes for the award. People are recognizing that he’s fighting for our race and want to reward him,” said Blanc.

Carlson, who has previously been employed at CNN and MSNBC, used to be your average right-wing mouthpiece, but in the last few years he has taken to spewing white nationalism. He tried to claim rap music, promoted the false narrative about white South African farmers being attacked, attacked immigrants and has also claimed that diversity is not improving the country. The only thing he hasn’t done at this stage is wear a hood and burn a cross on set.

Carlson’s racist ranting is attracting the attention of the alt-right blogosphere.

According to Columbia Journalism Review, “Other vocal fans of Carlson include Richard Spencer, David Duke, and white nationalist website The Daily Stormer. On August 24, 2018, The Daily Stormer published a post that noted gleefully, ‘Tucker Carlson is basically ‘Daily Stormer: The Show.’ Other than the language used, he is covering all of our talking points.”

The Daily Stormer is a white supremacist website.

However, the CJR article suggests that Carlson is a giant con. Although he portrays himself as the voice of downtrodden, blue-collar white men, Carlson comes from a wealthy family and is worth $8 million. But he realized there is a market for white rage.

“According to Nielsen Media Research, the top-rated markets for the show are Ft. Myers, Florida; Knoxville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; West Palm Beach, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada; Birmingham, Alabama; Orlando, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina; and Buffalo, New York. Only half of these cities went for Trump in the 2016 election, but they are (with the exception of Birmingham and Atlanta) overwhelmingly white and middle class, with an average age of 36. A large part of the jobs held by men in each city are in retail or construction,” said CJR writer Lyz Lenz."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Fucker-Carlson.png

With Hurricane Florence currently buffeting South Carolina, America and the world is beginning to see the effects of climate change which causes extreme weather.

However, some right-wingers are determined to stick their heads in the sand and refuse to believe that climate change exists.

Televangelist Jim Bakker said the storm is punishment from God for violating his laws.

“I blame the transgenders for this. We didn’t see these kinds of storms when I was growing up,” said Bakker. “God is punishing us for allowing boys to wear dresses and women to pretend they are men.”

He isn’t the only Christian fundamentalist who believes this. According to Right Wing Watch, pastor Rick Joyner also blamed extreme weather on sin.

“More than dumping too much CO2 into the air or anything else, the scripture makes it clear what causes these things,” said Joyner. “It is sin. Sin, which is clearly defined in scripture. One of the worst things we could do to bring a curse on a nation is the shedding of innocent blood. What could be more innocent than the unborn? And look at what America is doing.”

President Donald Trump has dismissed global warming as being a “Chinese hoax.” And some Republicans seem to have a hard time getting their facts straight about Hurricane Florence. Talk show host and former junkie Rush Limbaugh claimed the storm had sucked up sharks, which is the exact plot of the movie “Sharknado.”

“This appeared somewhere. ‘Florence Now Contains Sharks.’ I’m telling you,” he said. “Sharks are being lifted out of the Atlantic Ocean and dumped into the storm because it’s so strong. It’s sucking ’em in there—and then they’re gonna be in the waters. Of course, the only water that might contain sharks would be storm surge—it isn’t gonna be raining sharks—and that’s the predominant water source in a hurricane is rainfall.”"	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/jim-bakker-e1514353755547.jpeg

Just when you think that President Donald Trump can’t get worse, he proves you wrong,

Recently he said that he didn’t believe the official death toll from Hurricane Maria which hit Puerto Rico. The death toll has been recorded at about 3,000 people. However, Trump has declared his government’s relief mission was a resounding success and only about 18 people died.

Trump supporters also back the president. According to an Occidental Public Polling survey, 70 percent of Trump supporters believe the media inflated the death toll to make the president looked bad.

“The liberal media hates Trump and will do anything to make the president look bad,” said Don Callen, a Trump supporter from Tampa, Fla. “I reckon the media faked the numbers.”

And there are other Trump cultists who also believe this.

FOX News curmudgeon Lou Dobbs also backed the president.

“Only President Trump has had the guts to call out the Dems and national left wing media types, who have blindly accepted an amazing tortured inflation of the death toll, almost 50 times higher than the original count, and with scant evidence to support any of it,” said Dobbs. “How does that count go from dozens in the days after the storm to almost 3,000 nearly a year later? Well, it involves as many academicians as humanly possible in the effort, and then you watch the entire exercise become a farce.”

Also, Florida Gov. and Voldemort look-a-like Rick Scott felt the wrath of Trump cultists when he said the final death toll was more accurate. “I’ve been to Puerto Rico seven times and saw devastation firsthand,” said Scott in a tweet.

But he was attacked by Trump supporters.

“Stated like a politician running for a Senate seat. Trying to degrade @POTUS, who is under constant attack for EVERYTHING, doesn’t need someone he has helped tremendously trying to stick it to him. Not a good look on you,” said Carol Jordan Will."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/640px-Morning_after_Hurricane_Maria_37372721465.jpg

Former NFL star Colin Kaepernick simply won’t go away, much to the chagrin of Trump supporters. He has become the face of Nike and has boosted their sales by 31 percent. But Trump supporters are furious.

A Trump supporter in the Reddit group R_The Donald compared Kaepernick to Osama Bin Laden. “Kaepernick is just as bad as that turban topper, Bin Laden,” said Rusty43, “and we need to take care of him like Bin Laden. He needs to tried and executed for treason.”

Rusty43 wasn’t the only Trump supporters infuriated by Kaepernick and the NFL protest he sparked. Former NFL player Burgess Owens accused Kaepernick of assaulting America.

“We have to look at the bigger picture and understand in America that we’re under assault,” said Burgess in an appearance on FOX Business. “It’s like 9/11 and Pearl Harbor, we’re being assaulted by the left. And we need to understand who they are. They’re globalists, and they’re leftist globalists. The worst thing that can happen to our country is to let them get away with it and not understand what their long game is.”

Burgess also accused Kaepernick of being a “marxist.”

“As we see a little less of the kneeling, we’re still going to see the narrative by Nike,” said Owens, who is now a conservative commentator. “And that is a Marxist, who is going to be the face and commercial of the NFL going forward.”

Meanwhile, the protest against Kaepernick continues. Ben Zahn, mayor of Kenner, La. has banned Nike products from city facilities. “Under no circumstances will any Nike product or any product with the Nike logo be purchased for use or delivery at any city of Kenner Recreation Facility,” said Kenner in a memo.

He also added, “My decision is only to protect taxpayer dollars from being used in a political campaign. Some have asked if people will be allowed to wear Nike apparel on city playgrounds. The answer to that is … of course.”"	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kaepernick-e1536793956757.jpg

It should clear by now that FOX News commentator Tucker Carlson is an open white nationalist.

In a guest appearance on neo-fascist network CRTV, Carlson claimed that whites should get credit for rap music.

“The blacks try to act like they created rap music. But white people deserve the credit, because it’s performed in English,” said Carlson. “Also, the first rap superstar was Vanilla Ice, a white person. But liberal Hollywood doesn’t want to talk about the contribution whites have made to rap music.”

Hip hop is an artform that grew out of New York, when black DJs, starting “rapping” over songs. It has been popularized by African Americans and spread across the world as the voice of underprivileged people. But don’t tell that to Carlson, who seems to think rap came out of coffee houses in the suburbs.

Carlson has been spouting white supremacist rhetoric on FOX News for quite a while. Recently he tried to claim that diversity was not an asset to the United States.

“How, precisely, is diversity our strength? Since you’ve made this our new national motto, please be specific as you explain it. Can you think, for example, of other institutions such as, I don’t know, marriage or military units in which the less people have in common, the more cohesive they are?” said Carlson in a rant. “Do you get along better with your neighbors, your co-workers if you can’t understand each other or share no common values? Please be honest as you answer this question.”

Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple called Carlson’s diversity rant “flat-out racist”

However Carlson also tried to claim tacos as an American food.

“What do you mean ‘their food’? It’s American food,” said Carlson. “It’s American! What do you think, you own tacos now or something?”

Progressive media watchdog Media Matters compiled a collection of Carlson’s quotes and noticed they sounded similar to racists such as Richard Spencer and David Duke."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tucker.jpg

While most sane-minded Americans were excited to see former President Barack Obama return to the public sphere, Republicans weren’t.

Most Americans were pleased to see the return of a president who spoke in complete sentences and talked about decency, but not members of the GOP. FOX News minstrel-of-the-month Candace Owens said Obama has returned to the public stage because he’s jealous of Trump’s success.

“Obama just couldn’t stand to see Trump succeed where he has failed, for example the most successful economy in history and the record black unemployment rate. He had to stick his nose in,” said Owens, in an appearance on CRTV. “Obama’s so arrogant, it has to be all about him.”

Other Republicans were equally incensed that Obama dared to criticize the trainwreck that is the Trump presidency.

The response from FOX News commentator and Trump zealot Jeanine Pirro was particularly unhinged.

“It has never happened in the history of this country, an ex-president viciously attacking his successor, trashing our commander-in-chief, his party, and all those Americans who put him in the Oval Office,” said Pirro. “Donald Trump is one of the biggest threats to our democracy? How dare you! This man is the president of the United States, someone we put in office, and he is to be respected!”

She also accused Obama of worsening the racial situation.

“If anyone has stoked racial hatred and divisiveness it’s you and your self-proclaimed wingman Attorney General Eric Holder, running off to Ferguson, attacking all law enforcement, whenever there’s a death, even before there’s any investigation,” said Pirro.

And the response from former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu was even worse.

“What is this damn fool doing coming out of retirement to break with the tradition of not attacking sitting presidents? That was my first thought,” said Sununu on “FOX News.”

He added that Obama had “an insufferable ego.”"	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Candace-Owens-e1525094376844.jpg

By Peter West

Last week, the Trump administration was rocked by a New York Times Op-Ed which accused the president of being clueless about the inner workings of government. The op-ed came on the heels of Bob Woodward’s “Fear,” a book that exposed the chaotic inner workings of the Trump White House.

Trump supporters considered the op-ed a direct attack on the president and are calling for the most severe punishment.

“The author of the NY Times op-ed is obviously a traitorous, communist, liberal and deserves to be executed,” said far-right radio talk show host Michael Savage on his show.

Trump also seems to support Savage’s view. He called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate the author for treason, a crime punishable by death.

“Number one, the Times should never have done that, because really what they’ve done is virtually, you know, it’s treason, you could call it a lot of things,” said Trump during a campaign rally.

However, the president’s crazed response only seem to prove Woodward’s allegation correct. According to Time, Trump doesn’t understand the meaning of the word treason.

“His use of the term ‘treason’ – defined as ‘the crime of betraying one’s country, especially by attempting to kill or overthrow the sovereign or government’ – echoes a tweet he posted not long after the Times published the op-ed, reading simply ‘TREASON?’” said Billy Perrigo.

However, publishing a critical article doesn’t meet the definition of treason.

CNN’s Chris Cuomo said Trump’s over-the-top response to the editorial was disturbing.

“What the president has done in reaction to the last two days screams concern that he’s dealing with the truth. With him going on a hunt in the White House for who talked to Woodward. For him saying ‘The New York Times’ has to turn over their source to the government as a matter of national security? Do you realize how crazy that notion is, to even suggest, let alone from a president?” said Cuomo."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MichaelSavage.jpg

As President Donald Trump continues to unravel in front of our eyes, his supporters are only digging in deeper.

Earlier this week, Trump gave another rambling campaign speech in Billings, Mont. where he mispronounced “anonymous.” But his supporters dismissed the fact the president of the United States is slurring his words.

A poster in a Trump-supporting Facebook group suggested that Trump mangling his words is a sign of his intelligence.

“Sometimes people who are hyper intelligent stutter because their minds are working so fast,” said Bill Keane, a member of the “Make America White” Facebook group. “Trump is a stable genius.”

But Keane is not alone in his worship of the barely-sane Trump.

FOX News “psychologist” Gina Loudon also sang his praises on Sean Hannity’s show. Loudon discredited Bob Woodward’s book “Fear,” which painted the Trump White House as a sea of chaos.

“Woodward doesn’t know the president. I don’t know how many graduate courses he’s taken in psychology … I know his family and I know the people around him. I’ve seen him relaxing … I’ve seen him in the White House and you know him. You know how focused he is, how much he’s enjoying his job … and how unaffected he is by them,” said Loudon. “My book actually uses science and real data and true psychological theory to explain why it is quite possible that this president is the most sound-minded person to ever occupy the White House.”

However, while Loudon may vouch for the president’s mental stability, Trump continues to show people he is completely unfit for the job of commander-in-chief. Woodward’s book and the recent New York Times anonymous op-ed, both accuse Trump of being clueless about how government functions.

In response to the New York Times article, Trump has called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate the paper and look at treason charges."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Donald_Trump_with_supporters_27151781553.jpg

FOX News troll Jesse Watters claims President Donald Trump may have dirt on Special Counsel Robert Muller.

“There’s something personal between the president and Muller,” said Watters. “Maybe Mueller’s hiding something? Could the president have possession of a sex tape?”

Watters views are in line with Trump’s. Earlier this week, the president claimed he had incriminating pictures of Mueller and former FBI Director James Comey.

“But I had a business dispute with Mueller before that. I had a real business dispute. And he’s Comey’s best friend. And I could give you 100 pictures of him and Comey hugging and kissing each other. You know, he’s Comey’s best friend,” said Trump in an interview with neo-fascist rag, The Daily Caller.

The president has increasingly begun to go off the rails as he is buffeted from scandals from all sides, dismal poll ratings and Bob Woodward’s White House expose, “Fear.”

Earlier this week, the White House was rocked when an insider published an anonymous op ed in the New York Times claiming Trump was so out of control, staff members often hide things from him.

Woodward’s book also backed these claims. He wrote that Defense Secretary Gen. (rtd.) James Mattis had hidden a briefing from the president. Woodward also claimed that Trump had given an order to kill the entire Syrian administration.

British newspaper the Independent recently reported on excerpts from the book.

“After Bashar al-Assad launched a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017, Mr Trump is reported to have told his defence secretary he wanted the Syrian president assassinated. “Mr. Woodward’s alleges that the US leader called James Mattis and said: ‘Let’s f***ing kill him! Let’s go in. Let’s kill the f***ing lot of them,” said the Independent. “Mr Mattis told Mr Trump he would ‘get right on it’, but after hanging up the phone he told a senior aide: ‘We’re not going to do any of that. We’re going to be much more measured.’”"	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jesse-watters-e1489839820352.jpg

As California is being ravaged by one of the worst fire seasons in recent years, preacher Franklin Graham suggested the Golden State may have brought it on itself.

“I prayed over the issue and the message I got is California is being punished by God for its disobedience,” said Graham in a Charisma magazine interview. “California was the first state to legalize gay marriage and it has also been extremely defiant towards President Trump, now look at the situation they’re in.”

Graham’s views were shared by Kevin Swanson, another fundamentalist preacher.

“In 2011, California became the first state to mandate homosexual indoctrination for K-8 students and then, in 2012, California became the first state to sign a ban on therapy that was attempting to convert homosexuals into non-homosexuals. And then, in 2017, the California state schools implemented the homosexual indoctrination program … and that was the kickoff for the biggest fires that California has ever seen in its history,” said Swanson on “Generations” radio.“So God is burning down California in 2017 and 2018 after about 25 years of leading the pack to legitimize the sin of homosexuality in that state.”

In other news, the “stable genius” president continued to show his ignorance and aversion to reading in a comment about the fires. Trump claimed California’s policies were making the fires worse.

“California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized,” said Trump in a tweet. “It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!”

According to ThinkProgress, this comment was ridiculed by water and climate expert Peter Gleick.

“California’s forests are burning because of past severe drought and current extreme temperatures and weather, worsened by human-caused climate change, which you think, in your fantasy world, doesn’t exist,” said Gleick.

He also called Trump’s views “gobbledygook bulls**t” and “unmitigated crap.”"	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Franklin-Graham-bible-e1519088578532.jpg

U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) appeared on “Sunday Morning Futures” with host Maria Bartiromo and stated his intentions to make all the depositions taken in the Russia investigation public before the midterm elections.



Russiagate’s ‘Game of Thrones’: The ongoing partisan fued between Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Devin Nunes may soon be coming to an end with the stroke of Trump’s pen.

“I think full transparency is in order here, so I expect to make those available from our committee to the American public here in the next few weeks,” the congressman said in the interview with Bartiromo.

Nunes also said Americans deserve this level of transparency for an investigation that has obstructed the Trump administration’s agenda, and a large number of Americans “have drank this Russia Kool-Aid” as a result.

On Monday, President Trump did in fact order the declassifying of several key documents, just as Nunes had predicted in the interview.

Jeff Carlson, CPA, posted the two interview segments as well as a recap of the points made by Nunes to his blog and this tweet:

More from Jeff Carlson’s “Devin Nunes & 70 Depositions” below…

Devin Nunes appeared on Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo in two separate segments today. Several revelations were made – and virtually every word was important.

It truly was an amazing interview.

Nunes disclosed that over 70 depositions of individuals have occurred – and been recorded. This is new information

This is new information Nunes wants to make all of these depositions public.

Approximately 70% of these interviews are already declassified.

Nunes intends to send the remaining classified transcripts to DNI Coats for declassification shortly.

Nunes expects to obtain declassification.

Nunes expects to make the transcripts available to the American public within the next few weeks – before the mid-term elections.

Nunes believes President Trump will declassify the Carter Page FISA & Bruce Ohr documents – before the mid-term elections.

The FBI & DOJ were both directly involved in leaking fake news stories.

The planted news stories were used as a pretext to interview American citizens.

Planted news stories were used to corroborate the Page FISA to the FISA Court.

There was an unprecedented level of cooperation & coordination between the Clinton Campaign, Fusion GPS, the FBI & DOJ and the Department of State.

Nunes references 2-3 dozen reporters as being fed fake stories from these sources.

These stories were then disseminated to use as the basis for an investigation.

Bartiromo closes with this warning:

If the House flips in November, you will no longer be the Chairman, perhaps your colleague on the Left, Adam Schiff, may very well be. We won’t hear another word about this story.

You can watch two video clips below. For partial transcripts, go here.

Clip #1, ‘Russiagate’ interview starts at 5 minute mark:

Clip #2, Nunes describes the ‘planting of fake news stories’ by the FBI and others:

In November, incumbent politicians pouring the ‘Russia Kool-Aid’ on the American people will be faced with tough questions from their constituencies like ‘What have you been doing for the last two years?’

And if all the depositions in the Russia investigation are indeed declassified and released to the public before midterms, as Chairman Nunes intends, the entire ‘Russiagate’ narrative, the Mueller probe, and the Democrats’ grand plans for a ‘blue wave’ flip of the U.S. House could all come crashing down. This is important.

884307c29fc344cf93473e4a35c67d2f	[]	2018-09-15 00:00:00	Erdogan, Putin to Meet Monday in Sochi as Turkey Moves More Weapons into Syria	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	Erdogan, Putin to Meet Monday in Sochi as Turkey Moves More Weapons into Syria	0	"By

Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is scheduled to meet Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in Sochi on Monday, amid reports of a heavy Turkish arms drop into Syria in recent days.

The two leaders last met at a summit earlier this month in Tehran, and this next meeting will come just days after the Turkish army sent more ‘arms and ammunition’ into Syria’s Idlib and Hama provinces, according to a report by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) released on Saturday.

The independent media outlet Muraselon is also citing multiple reports of both Turkish weapons and troops moving into these regions, including to areas under the control of the ‘rebel’ coalition National Liberation Front (NLF) – a collection of unsavory characters and the main rival of Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) in Idlib, according to IRIN:

Turkey’s favourite is the NLF, which is led by Fadlallah al-Hajji, a Muslim Brotherhood ally. The NLF includes Turkey-friendly Islamists like Ahrar al-Sham, the Noureddine al-Zengi Brigades, Failaq al-Sham, Jaish al-Ahrar, and groups that fought under the Free Syrian Army banner, like the Victory Army and the 2nd Coastal Division. Big but brittle, the NLF is held together by Turkish sponsorship and shared enemies: al-Assad’s government, Syrian Kurdish groups, and hardline jihadists.

Turkey’s escalated military presence and heavy arms drop into known jihadist havens ahead of the upcoming Sochi meeting is unwelcome, and presents the potential risk for a military showdown in the future between Turkish and Syrian/Russian forces – something that all sides have warned against but Turkey’s apparent ‘double-dealing’ isn’t helping.

Peter Ford, former British Ambassador to Syria, with a rather useful media guide, aptly described as, “The Dirty Dozen: 12 lies they tell you to anaesthetise you for the upcoming bombing of Syria.”

Peter Ford

21st Century Wire

The propaganda mills of the British and American governments – spokespersons, media, think tanks – are working overtime churning out ‘talking points’ to justify the upcoming large scale bombing of Syria on the pretext of use of prohibited weapons.

Here is a guide from a former insider to the top dozen of these lies.

1. There are more babies than jihadis in Idlib. As it happens this gem of moral blackmail is untrue. There are twice as many jihadis (about 100,000) as babies (0-1 year) (55,000). What is this factoid meant to say anyway? Don’t try to free an area of jihadis because you might harm a lot of children? The Western coalition scarcely heeded that consideration in razing Mosul and Raqqa in order to crush ISIS. They are still pulling babies out of the rubble in Raqqa.

2. The reports [of the imminent chemical weapons ‘attack’] must be true because Assad has done it before. False. Since 2013 when Assad gave up chemical weapons under supervision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) the OPCW have not visited the sites of alleged attacks in jihadi-controlled areas but have accepted at face value ‘reports’ from pro-jihadi organisations like the White Helmets and the Syrian American Medical Society, along with ‘evidence’ from hostile intelligence agencies. In the case of the one site the OPCW did visit, Douma, their report said they found no evidence of sarin, no untoward traces in any of the blood samples taken from ‘alleged victims’ (their term), no bodies and only ambiguous evidence of use of chlorine.

3. The OPCW report on Douma was flawed because the Russians and Syrians caused delay. False. As documented in the OPCW report, delay was caused by UN bureaucracy and jihadi snipers. The inspectors do not say their findings were to any significant degree invalidated by the delay.

4. Assad uses chemical weapons because they frighten large numbers of people into fleeing. False. They don’t. This desperate argument is trotted out to counter the fact that Assad would have to be stupid to use chemical weapons knowing what the result would be and that he would derive minimal military benefit.

5. The OPCW won’t be able to investigate because it won’t be safe. A feeble excuse to preempt calls for establishing facts before bombing. The Turks escort Western journalists into Idlib.

10. There are going to be massacres, a bloodbath, or ‘genocide’. False. We heard all this hysteria before Aleppo, before Eastern Ghouta and before the campaign in the South. All vastly exaggerated. The Syrian Arab Army has not been responsible for a single massacre, while the jihadis have been responsible for many (source: quarterly reports of the UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria).

11. People have nowhere to go. False. The Russians have opened safe corridors but the jihadis are not allowing people to leave. They can still leave for the northern border strip which Turkey controls, where there are camps, and many (including jihadi fighters) will be able to cross temporarily into Turkey.

12. We can’t tell you which armed groups we support because it would make them targets for Assad. Really? You think he doesn’t know? Isn’t it because you are terrified it will come out that we have been supporting some real head-choppers?

More Syrian Arab Army (SAA) spy films, this time from a border-crossing controlled by Turkish-backed and FSA ‘rebel’ forces in northwestern Aleppo.

Al Masdar News reports…

BEIRUT, LEBANON (1:20 P.M.) – A Syrian Arab Army (SAA) spy filmed from a Turkish border-crossing controlled by the rebel forces in Aleppo recently.

Based on the video that was released by the official media wing of the Tiger Forces, the Syrian Army spy filmed from the border-town of Banes, which is located in northwestern Aleppo.

Banes is located inside the Afrin region, which was fully captured by the Turkish-backed rebels in March of this year.

As shown in the video below, the Syrian Army is filming at a road sign near Turkish border-crossing in the Afrin region:



Prior to the seizure of the Afrin region by the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and their Turkish-backed allies, this area was controlled by the Kurdish-led People’s Protection Units (YPG).

Since losing the Afrin region, the YPG’s sleeper cells have been wrecking havoc on the Turkish-backed rebels that were evacuated from the East Ghouta region of Damascus.

By Stephen Lendman

The die is cast in Syria. The mother of all battles to eliminate US-supported terrorists in Idlib province looms.

During a Tuesday Security Council session, Russia’s envoy Vasily Nebenzia repeated what he, Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov, and Syrian UN envoy Bashar al-Jaafari stressed earlier.

“(U)ndeniable proof” shows US-supported terrorists and White Helmets infesting Idlib intend staging a false flag CW attack on civilians used as props – the staged incident to be wrongfully blamed on Damascus.

It’s one of the oldest most despicable dirty tricks in the book, used to launch wars based on Big Lies or escalate them.

The same ugly stunt occurred before. Not a shred of credible evidence suggests Syrian forces ever used CWs any time throughout the war – or that it retains any now.

Its entire stockpile was eliminated. On June 17, 2015, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) headlined “Disposal of effluents from neutralized Syrian chemical weapons completed,” saying:

The OPCW “welcomes the completion of disposal of effluents resulting from neutralization operations aboard the US vessel Cape Ray.”

“These operations governed the destruction at sea of almost 600 metric tonnes of sulphur mustard and methylphosphonyl difluoride (DF) from Syria’s chemical weapons programme. DF is a key precursor chemical for manufacturing nerve agent.”

At the time, OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu called the above efforts “yet another milestone on the path to eliminating chemical weapons stocks from Syria…”

US-supported terrorist alone used chemical and other toxic agents numerous times throughout the war – banned substances supplied by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and perhaps other countries.

Pentagon contractors in Jordan trained US-supported terrorists in the use of CWs, likely still doing it.

Syrian forces liberated most parts of the country using conventional weapons alone, greatly aided by Russian airpower – their operations entirely legal.

During Tuesday’s Security Council session, Russian UN envoy Nebenzia clearly explained that “the use of chemical weapons by Damascus has no military grounds and is harmful from the military and political point of view as it would be an invitation for the Western trio to attack Syria,” adding:

Permitting what Sergey Lavrov called an “abscess” to remain in Idlib is absolutely unacceptable.

On Tuesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said “(w)e cannot let Idlib remain a terrorist stronghold.”

A US/UK orchestrated CW false flag in Idlib is imminent. On Tuesday, Russia’s reconciliation center in Syria said the following:

“According to the information received from inhabitants of Idlib province, (US-supported terrorists and White Helmets) are now filming a staged provocation in the city of Jisr al-Shugur, where ‘chemical weapons’ are depicted as being used by the Syrian army against civilians.”

“The film crews of several Middle Eastern TV channels arrived in Jisr al-Shugur in the morning, as well as the regional affiliate of one of the main American television news networks.”

“The plot envisages staged scenes showing ‘activists’ from the…’White Helmets’ ‘helping’ the residents of Jisr al-Shughur after the Syrian army allegedly used the so-called barrel bombs with poisonous substances.”

“All the footage of the staged provocation in Jisr al-Shughur is to be delivered to the newsrooms of TV channels, which are to broadcast it after its publication on social media.”

In preparation for the false flag, canisters of weaponized chlorine were delivered to the planned crime scene.

Ahead of the incident, media scoundrels disgracefully claimed Assad approved use of chlorine gas (and possibly deadly sarin) in Idlib – a Big Lie, citing unnamed US sources.

Naked aggression is always based on lies repeated ad nauseam, getting most people to believe what anyone following reliable reliable independent sources of news, information and analysis knows is untrue.

The stage is set in Idlib – another CW false flag imminent – the incident to be used by the US, UK and France to terror-bomb Syrian sites, likely more aggressively than earlier.

How Russia intends responding to the scheme remains unknown. Its numerous warships in the region and state-of-the-art missile defense in Syria can neutralize a US-led attack when launched.

Much rides on whether and how it may challenge the Trump regime’s aim to prevent Idlib’s liberation, along with wanting sovereign Syria replaced by pro-Western puppet rule.

21WIRE’s Vanessa Beeley has reported from Syria that ISIS has moved into Idlib, arriving in the city of Jisr Al Shughour which is close to the border of Latakia:

“Haras Al Deen is coalition of Nusra Front #AlQaeda & ISIS fighters who arrived in Jisr Al Shughour 3 days ago suspected to be fm Iraq via Turkey. 2000 strong force. Territory extends to North of Lattakia” via @khalediskef #ldlib @21WIRE — vanessa beeley (@VanessaBeeley) September 11, 2018

This is the ‘carte blanche’ U.S. forces need to muscle into Idlib on the back of their self-styled mandate for occupying Syria which is to “Fight ISIS.” Recent statements from the U.S. about possibly intervening in Idlib may have alluded to this very possibility. Such a move by U.S. would exacerbate an already tense situation between the Syrian and Russian coalition at attempting to liberate the province from its al-Qaeda led terrorist occupation. The US have also deployed a detachment of combat Marines into Syria this week. Add to this, a confused Turkey who is torn between the rebel-terrorists groups it’s been hosting and supporting for the last 7 years and wanting to also eliminate any Kurdish opposition in northern Syria – while trying to maintain a respectable face with its Astana and NATO partners.

A staged chemical stunt may not be needed by the US to intervene in Idlib, if instead ‘ISIS’ becomes the US imperative, thus using the cut-out bait terror group to justify the ongoing US disruption and illegal ‘train and equip’ operations in Syria. As long as ISIS fighters are there, so are U.S. forces – such is official Washington’s public-facing policy.

All of the outrage about an “impending massacre” in Idlib may also be a ploy so Turkey and the U.S. can both move in to take up positions and thus allowing al-Qaeda/ Nusra and other terrorists to extend their occupation of key parts of the province – which will of course only extend the war, along with both U.S. and Turkish illegal occupations in Syria.

The propaganda mills of the British and American governments – spokespersons, media, think tanks – are working overtime churning out ‘talking points’ to justify the upcoming large scale bombing of Syria on the pretext of use of prohibited weapons.

Here is a guide from a former insider to the top dozen of these lies.

1. There are more babies than jihadis in Idlib. As it happens this gem of moral blackmail is untrue. There are twice as many jihadis (about 100,000) as babies (0-1 year) (55,000). What is this factoid meant to say anyway? Don’t try to free an area of jihadis because you might harm a lot of children? The Western coalition scarcely heeded that consideration in razing Mosul and Raqqa in order to crush ISIS. They are still pulling babies out of the rubble in Raqqa.

2. The reports [of the imminent chemical weapons ‘attack’] must be true because Assad has done it before. False. Since 2013 when Assad gave up chemical weapons under supervision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) the OPCW have not visited the sites of alleged attacks in jihadi-controlled areas but have accepted at face value ‘reports’ from pro-jihadi organisations like the White Helmets and the Syrian American Medical Society, along with ‘evidence’ from hostile intelligence agencies. In the case of the one site the OPCW did visit, Douma, their report said they found no evidence of sarin, no untoward traces in any of the blood samples taken from ‘alleged victims’ (their term), no bodies and only ambiguous evidence of use of chlorine.

3. The OPCW report on Douma was flawed because the Russians and Syrians caused delay. False. As documented in the OPCW report, delay was caused by UN bureaucracy and jihadi snipers. The inspectors do not say their findings were to any significant degree invalidated by the delay.

4. Assad uses chemical weapons because they frighten large numbers of people into fleeing. False. They don’t. This desperate argument is trotted out to counter the fact that Assad would have to be stupid to use chemical weapons knowing what the result would be and that he would derive minimal military benefit. To date, not one of the alleged chemical attacks has precipitated an exodus any greater than flight caused by the legendary ‘barrel bombs’. The inhabitants of Douma by their own testimonies given to Western journalists were even unaware there might have been an attack until they heard about it in the media.

5. The OPCW won’t be able to investigate because it won’t be safe. A feeble excuse to preempt calls for establishing facts before bombing. The Turks escort Western journalists into Idlib. They have hundreds of troops there and the jihadis kowtow to them because they control all logistics. The Turks could escort OPCW. And wouldn’t the jihadis be keener than anybody for the inspectors to visit if their claims were true?

6. The upcoming strikes are not aimed at regime change. False. The plan is to decapitate the Syrian state with attacks on the presidency. Failing that the aim is to make Idlib a quagmire for the Russians. Anything to deprive Asad and Putin of victory, regardless of whether it prolongs the war.

7. It’s all Russian disinformation. Yeah, like the arms inspectors before the Iraq war who said no WMD in Iraq. Reality: the Russians have got great intelligence on what Western powers with their jihadi clients are up to and are calling out the phoney moves.

8. There won’t be enough time for parliamentary debate. Pull the other one. Reality: the government are terrified of a rerun of 2013 when Labour and 30 brave Tory MPs voted against bombing, causing Cameron and then Obama to back off.

9. MPs can’t be told what is planned because it would jeopardise the safety of service personnel. How low can you stoop? Feigning concern for flyers when it’s really just about keeping the people in ignorance of how big the strikes are going to be.

10. There are going to be massacres, a bloodbath, or ‘genocide’. False. We heard all this hysteria before Aleppo, before Eastern Ghouta and before the campaign in the South. All vastly exaggerated. The Syrian Arab Army has not been responsible for a single massacre, while the jihadis have been responsible for many (source: quarterly reports of the UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria).

U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) appeared on “Sunday Morning Futures” with host Maria Bartiromo and stated his intentions to make all the depositions taken in the Russia investigation public before the midterm elections.



Russiagate’s ‘Game of Thrones’: The ongoing partisan fued between Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Devin Nunes may soon be coming to an end with the stroke of Trump’s pen.

“I think full transparency is in order here, so I expect to make those available from our committee to the American public here in the next few weeks,” the congressman said in the interview with Bartiromo.

Nunes also said Americans deserve this level of transparency for an investigation that has obstructed the Trump administration’s agenda, and a large number of Americans “have drank this Russia Kool-Aid” as a result.

On Monday, President Trump did in fact order the declassifying of several key documents, just as Nunes had predicted in the interview.

Jeff Carlson, CPA, posted the two interview segments as well as a recap of the points made by Nunes to his blog and this tweet:

1) Some interviews are more important than others.

@DevinNunes appeared on Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo in two separate segments today. Several revelations were made – and virtually every word was important.

More from Jeff Carlson’s “Devin Nunes & 70 Depositions” below…

Devin Nunes appeared on Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo in two separate segments today. Several revelations were made – and virtually every word was important.

It truly was an amazing interview.

Nunes disclosed that over 70 depositions of individuals have occurred – and been recorded. This is new information

This is new information Nunes wants to make all of these depositions public.

Approximately 70% of these interviews are already declassified.

Nunes intends to send the remaining classified transcripts to DNI Coats for declassification shortly.

Nunes expects to obtain declassification.

Nunes expects to make the transcripts available to the American public within the next few weeks – before the mid-term elections.

Nunes believes President Trump will declassify the Carter Page FISA & Bruce Ohr documents – before the mid-term elections.

The FBI & DOJ were both directly involved in leaking fake news stories.

The planted news stories were used as a pretext to interview American citizens.

Planted news stories were used to corroborate the Page FISA to the FISA Court.

There was an unprecedented level of cooperation & coordination between the Clinton Campaign, Fusion GPS, the FBI & DOJ and the Department of State.

Nunes references 2-3 dozen reporters as being fed fake stories from these sources.

These stories were then disseminated to use as the basis for an investigation.

Bartiromo closes with this warning:

If the House flips in November, you will no longer be the Chairman, perhaps your colleague on the Left, Adam Schiff, may very well be. We won’t hear another word about this story.

***

You can watch two video clips below. For partial transcripts, go here.

Clip #1, ‘Russiagate’ interview starts at 5 minute mark:

Clip #2, Nunes describes the ‘planting of fake news stories’ by the FBI and others:

In November, incumbent politicians pouring the ‘Russia Kool-Aid’ on the American people will be faced with tough questions from their constituencies like ‘What have you been doing for the last two years?’

And if all the depositions in the Russia investigation are indeed declassified and released to the public before midterms, as Chairman Nunes intends, the entire ‘Russiagate’ narrative, the Mueller probe, and the Democrats’ grand plans for a ‘blue wave’ flip of the U.S. House could all come crashing down. This is important.

The two leaders last met at a summit earlier this month in Tehran, and this next meeting will come just days after the Turkish army sent more ‘arms and ammunition’ into Syria’s Idlib and Hama provinces, according to a report by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) released on Saturday.

The independent media outlet Muraselon is also citing multiple reports of both Turkish weapons and troops moving into these regions, including to areas under the control of the ‘rebel’ coalition National Liberation Front (NLF) – a collection of unsavory characters and the main rival of Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) in Idlib, according to IRIN:

Turkey’s favourite is the NLF, which is led by Fadlallah al-Hajji, a Muslim Brotherhood ally. The NLF includes Turkey-friendly Islamists like Ahrar al-Sham, the Noureddine al-Zengi Brigades, Failaq al-Sham, Jaish al-Ahrar, and groups that fought under the Free Syrian Army banner, like the Victory Army and the 2nd Coastal Division. Big but brittle, the NLF is held together by Turkish sponsorship and shared enemies: al-Assad’s government, Syrian Kurdish groups, and hardline jihadists.

Turkey’s escalated military presence and heavy arms drop into known jihadist havens ahead of the upcoming Sochi meeting is unwelcome, and presents the potential risk for a military showdown in the future between Turkish and Syrian/Russian forces – something that all sides have warned against but Turkey’s apparent ‘double-dealing’ isn’t helping.

More Syrian Arab Army (SAA) spy films, this time from a border-crossing controlled by Turkish-backed and FSA ‘rebel’ forces in northwestern Aleppo.

BEIRUT, LEBANON (1:20 P.M.) – A Syrian Arab Army (SAA) spy filmed from a Turkish border-crossing controlled by the rebel forces in Aleppo recently.

Based on the video that was released by the official media wing of the Tiger Forces, the Syrian Army spy filmed from the border-town of Banes, which is located in northwestern Aleppo.

Banes is located inside the Afrin region, which was fully captured by the Turkish-backed rebels in March of this year.

As shown in the video below, the Syrian Army is filming at a road sign near Turkish border-crossing in the Afrin region:



Prior to the seizure of the Afrin region by the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and their Turkish-backed allies, this area was controlled by the Kurdish-led People’s Protection Units (YPG).

Since losing the Afrin region, the YPG’s sleeper cells have been wrecking havoc on the Turkish-backed rebels that were evacuated from the East Ghouta region of Damascus.

By Stephen Lendman

The die is cast in Syria. The mother of all battles to eliminate US-supported terrorists in Idlib province looms.

During a Tuesday Security Council session, Russia’s envoy Vasily Nebenzia repeated what he, Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov, and Syrian UN envoy Bashar al-Jaafari stressed earlier.

“(U)ndeniable proof” shows US-supported terrorists and White Helmets infesting Idlib intend staging a false flag CW attack on civilians used as props – the staged incident to be wrongfully blamed on Damascus.

It’s one of the oldest most despicable dirty tricks in the book, used to launch wars based on Big Lies or escalate them.

The same ugly stunt occurred before. Not a shred of credible evidence suggests Syrian forces ever used CWs any time throughout the war – or that it retains any now.

Its entire stockpile was eliminated. On June 17, 2015, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) headlined “Disposal of effluents from neutralized Syrian chemical weapons completed,” saying:

The OPCW “welcomes the completion of disposal of effluents resulting from neutralization operations aboard the US vessel Cape Ray.”

“These operations governed the destruction at sea of almost 600 metric tonnes of sulphur mustard and methylphosphonyl difluoride (DF) from Syria’s chemical weapons programme. DF is a key precursor chemical for manufacturing nerve agent.”

At the time, OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu called the above efforts “yet another milestone on the path to eliminating chemical weapons stocks from Syria…”

US-supported terrorist alone used chemical and other toxic agents numerous times throughout the war – banned substances supplied by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and perhaps other countries.

Pentagon contractors in Jordan trained US-supported terrorists in the use of CWs, likely still doing it.

Syrian forces liberated most parts of the country using conventional weapons alone, greatly aided by Russian airpower – their operations entirely legal.

During Tuesday’s Security Council session, Russian UN envoy Nebenzia clearly explained that “the use of chemical weapons by Damascus has no military grounds and is harmful from the military and political point of view as it would be an invitation for the Western trio to attack Syria,” adding:

Permitting what Sergey Lavrov called an “abscess” to remain in Idlib is absolutely unacceptable.

On Tuesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said “(w)e cannot let Idlib remain a terrorist stronghold.”

A US/UK orchestrated CW false flag in Idlib is imminent. On Tuesday, Russia’s reconciliation center in Syria said the following:

“According to the information received from inhabitants of Idlib province, (US-supported terrorists and White Helmets) are now filming a staged provocation in the city of Jisr al-Shugur, where ‘chemical weapons’ are depicted as being used by the Syrian army against civilians.”

“The film crews of several Middle Eastern TV channels arrived in Jisr al-Shugur in the morning, as well as the regional affiliate of one of the main American television news networks.”

“The plot envisages staged scenes showing ‘activists’ from the…’White Helmets’ ‘helping’ the residents of Jisr al-Shughur after the Syrian army allegedly used the so-called barrel bombs with poisonous substances.”

“All the footage of the staged provocation in Jisr al-Shughur is to be delivered to the newsrooms of TV channels, which are to broadcast it after its publication on social media.”

In preparation for the false flag, canisters of weaponized chlorine were delivered to the planned crime scene.

Ahead of the incident, media scoundrels disgracefully claimed Assad approved use of chlorine gas (and possibly deadly sarin) in Idlib – a Big Lie, citing unnamed US sources.

Naked aggression is always based on lies repeated ad nauseam, getting most people to believe what anyone following reliable reliable independent sources of news, information and analysis knows is untrue.

The stage is set in Idlib – another CW false flag imminent – the incident to be used by the US, UK and France to terror-bomb Syrian sites, likely more aggressively than earlier.

How Russia intends responding to the scheme remains unknown. Its numerous warships in the region and state-of-the-art missile defense in Syria can neutralize a US-led attack when launched.

Much rides on whether and how it may challenge the Trump regime’s aim to prevent Idlib’s liberation, along with wanting sovereign Syria replaced by pro-Western puppet rule.

21WIRE’s Vanessa Beeley has reported from Syria that ISIS has moved into Idlib, arriving in the city of Jisr Al Shughour which is close to the border of Latakia:

“Haras Al Deen is coalition of Nusra Front #AlQaeda & ISIS fighters who arrived in Jisr Al Shughour 3 days ago suspected to be fm Iraq via Turkey. 2000 strong force. Territory extends to North of Lattakia” via @khalediskef #ldlib @21WIRE — vanessa beeley (@VanessaBeeley) September 11, 2018

This is the ‘carte blanche’ U.S. forces need to muscle into Idlib on the back of their self-styled mandate for occupying Syria which is to “Fight ISIS.” Recent statements from the U.S. about possibly intervening in Idlib may have alluded to this very possibility. Such a move by U.S. would exacerbate an already tense situation between the Syrian and Russian coalition at attempting to liberate the province from its al-Qaeda led terrorist occupation. The US have also deployed a detachment of combat Marines into Syria this week. Add to this, a confused Turkey who is torn between the rebel-terrorists groups it’s been hosting and supporting for the last 7 years and wanting to also eliminate any Kurdish opposition in northern Syria – while trying to maintain a respectable face with its Astana and NATO partners.

A staged chemical stunt may not be needed by the US to intervene in Idlib, if instead ‘ISIS’ becomes the US imperative, thus using the cut-out bait terror group to justify the ongoing US disruption and illegal ‘train and equip’ operations in Syria. As long as ISIS fighters are there, so are U.S. forces – such is official Washington’s public-facing policy.

All of the outrage about an “impending massacre” in Idlib may also be a ploy so Turkey and the U.S. can both move in to take up positions and thus allowing al-Qaeda/ Nusra and other terrorists to extend their occupation of key parts of the province – which will of course only extend the war, along with both U.S. and Turkish illegal occupations in Syria.

The US Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday requested that WikiLeaks founder and editor Julian Assange testify on Russian ‘meddling’ in the 2016 election.

The ‘mutually agreed upon time and location’ also comes with the strict condition from Assange’s legal team that “testimony must conform to a high ethical standard,” according to this Wikileaks tweet:

BREAKING: US Senate Intelligence Committee calls editor @JulianAssange to testify. Letter delivered via US embassy in London.

A meeting between the Wikileaks publisher and the US Senate Intelligence Committee has the potential to put the entire ‘Russiagate’ investigation in jeopardy because it “hinges on conspiracy,” 21WIRE’s Patrick Henningsen told RT. Watch:



If Assange does testify, he could completely destroy the US narrative on Russian ‘meddling’ and interference:

Others in independent media, including mega entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, have speculated that this event would bring the entire ‘Russia hoax’ to its conclusion:

Julian Assange has finally been asked to testify to the US Senate about ‘Russian interference’ in the 2016 US election. The Clinton funded Russia hoax is coming to an end. His name was #SethRich — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) August 8, 2018

Can this meeting be trusted? Is it being used to somehow compromise Assange’s refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London? There are major ethical concerns here. Earlier this summer, several US Democratic Senators signed on to revoke his asylum status:

For burgeoning technocrats, it seems that the Establishment’s contrived ‘fake news crisis‘ is the gift that just keeps on giving. As Facebook moves into its latest Orwellian phase of political censorship, critics are beginning to ask what will become of the Silicon Valley’s most famous digital monopoly. Has Facebook sold out its user base? Will intelligent and influential content producers and consumers now begin migrating in greater numbers to more Constitutional or free speech-friendly social media platforms? Sputnik Radio’s cutting edge program Trend Storm explores this question with special guests, 21WIRE’s Patrick Henningsen and Joaquin Flores, Editor-in-Chief of Fort Russ News.

If the British then hand over Assange to the US, he will face an uncertain fate which could range from a military tribunal, to federal imprisonment, or even the death penalty for the high crimes of espionage and treason.

Moreno was not shy about his own bias in the case saying, “I’ve never agreed with the activity Mr. Assange performs, I’ve never agreed with the intervention in people’s emails to obtain information despite how valuable it is to shed light on some undesirable acts by governments and people… There are correct and legal ways to it.”

Professor Piers Robinson, Co-Director of the Organisation for Propaganda Studies, and Chair in Politics, Society and Political Journalism at the University of Sheffield, spoke to Sky News about the Skripal case, Russia and Syria, reiterating that ‘more evidence is needed’ before the British government’s claims can be legitimately stood up:

“We are being asked to place faith and trust in Theresa May and the intelligence services but we haven’t actually been presented with the facts and the evidence which actually does confirm the claim that’s being made. So we really need to step back and look for more, and as some of the representatives in UN Security Council were saying yesterday we need to really have more evidence before this claim can be stood up if there is the evidence to support the fact that is was certainly GRU.”

Robinson also addressed the ‘dangerous politicization’ some British diplomats may use in an attempt to conflate the Skripal affair and the situation in Syria:

“We also need to be very aware that this might become politicized and used as part of accusations and claims being made in the context Syria. And I would add that Karen Pierce did actually make that link herself in the discussion with journalists after the UN Security Council meeting yesterday, where she talked about Russia and the Syrian government and international norms, etc.”

In a recent online interview, Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg talks about the possibility of Julian Assange being tried in the US under the Espionage Act for publishing classified material.

Joe Lauria, Editor in Chief of Consortium News, spoke to Ellsberg during an ‘online vigil’ for the WikiLeaks founder and editor organized by Unity4J.com.

The online interview series has featured Bill Binney, Jimmy Dore, Kim Dotcom, George Galloway, Chris Hedges, Caitlin Johnstone, Peter Lavelle, Daniel McAdams, Ray McGovern, Cynthia McKinney, Craig Murray, Mark Sleboda and many others.

In the interview, Ellsberg lays out his case for why Assange can’t be tried fairly under the Espionage Act. The whistleblower emeritus said because Assange was the publisher of the classified material, not technically the whistleblower, he was in effect a journalist.

“The stakes here are nothing less than freedom of the press,” Ellsberg concluded.

Towards the end of the interview, Lauria also throws a wildcard scenario on the table for how Assange might become a ‘free man’ – stepping out onto the streets of London with the help of Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met for a summit outside Berlin last weekend. Here’s a recap of the event from Strategic Culture…

Peter Korzun

Strategic Culture

Russian President Vladimir Putin has wound up his European trip to include the Austrian FM’s wedding ceremony and talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The drop-in visit to Austria showed that Putin enjoys good personal relations with the representatives of Europe’s political beau monde. They see nothing odd in inviting him to social events, such as the wedding of Austrian FM Karin Kneissl, especially if the organizers want to grab the media spotlight.

This was followed by a summit with the German chancellor — the second time the two leaders have met in just over three months. The previous meeting took place in the Black Sea city of Sochi in May. The chancellor has visited Russia several times.

The “Meseberg Castle talks” in Germany were substantive and detailed, as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has noted, but evidently important enough that few details were made public. For some time the leaders talked tête-à-tête without interpreters. They compared notes on Ukraine (including the prospects for a UN-sponsored peace mission and the EU’s new role of mediator), Syria (and the problems of its reconstruction), the US sanctions on Iran, and the future of the Nord Stream 2 undersea gas-pipeline project.

There were no agreements planned for the meeting, but the “America First” policy is pushing these two countries that are divided by their different views on international issues toward a closer cooperation. Russia can play a very important role in creating the right conditions under which the Syrian refugees could leave Germany and return home, thus mitigating that pressing problem. Syria’s reconstruction is opening up new opportunities for Russian-German cooperation.

President Putin and Chancellor Merkel discussed the idea of a meeting on Syria involving the leaders of France and Turkey as well as Russia and Germany. They agreed to launch new talks under this format. No date for that four-nation summit was set.

Some time ago, such a visit to Germany and Austria was hardly conceivable and any hope of reviving a dialog would have seemed far-fetched. The times are changing, reflecting the need to get that relationship back to normal. Conflicts and negative emotions are giving way to cool-headed, constructive approaches. Besides, Russia has demonstrated its ability to resist pressure.

Right on the eve of the Putin-Merkel summit, the Wall Street Journal published an article about the sanctions being prepared by the US to stop Nord Stream 2. It’s time for Germany to stand tall and continue to pursue that project. During the talks with President Putin, Chancellor Merkel said that’s exactly what she is going to do. A cursory look at history supports her position.

In the early 1980s the administration of US President Ronald Reagan was trying to prevent Western Europe and the Soviet Union from working together over energy. Sanctions were used as an instrument to force them into submission. Despite that, the “Brotherhood” pipeline (Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod), also dubbed the Siberian pipeline or the Yamal project, was born in the heat of the Cold War. The framework agreement between West Germany and the USSR was signed in July 1981. Chancellor Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik policy was continued, to everyone’s benefit. In November 1982, the sanctions were lifted, and on January 1, 1984, natural gas started to flow. The similarity between Yamal and Nord Stream 2 is obvious. Resisting pressure benefits the one who refuses to kneel.

Germany is not alone. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is a strong supporter of Nord Stream 2. The Republic of Austria became the first country in Western Europe to sign a gas contract with the Soviet Union in 1968. In 2017, a new record for Russian gas exports to Austria was set at 9.1 billion cubic meters, an increase of 50.3% (3 billion cubic meters) from 2016 (6.1 billion cubic meters) and 33.8% (2.3 billion cubic meters) from 2005, when the previous record had been reached (6.8 billion cubic meters).

Donald Trump is very critical of the German chancellor, whose government is not as strong as it used to be. The idea to withdraw American forces from Germany has recently been floated. The ongoing rift between the US and its European NATO allies opens up the question of the continent’s security.

Before the July NATO summit, the chancellor came out in support of President Macron’s initiative to create a European expeditionary force. It was Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the current German president and then foreign minister, who launched a European arms–control initiative in 2016. And it was West Germany who signed the Treaty of Moscow with the USSR in August, 1970 which contributed to détente. During the meeting with Vladimir Putin, Angela Merkel emphasized that disagreements with Moscow must be resolved through dialog. She feels that there are many conflicts that can be settled if the two nations cooperate.

Indeed, Russia and Germany historically have had a special relationship. They began cooperating economically and working to ease political tensions against the backdrop of confrontation between the West and East. They can do so again. The Meseberg meeting showed that both sides realize the importance of dialog and the need to avoid at all costs any return to the Cold War.

For the last two years, the big tech giants have assured us they were not censoring anyone, adamantly adhering to the American rights of free speech, even testifying to this effect before congress. Of course, anyone with any sense under age 70 knew full well this was total nonsense, but now the coordinated effort of the big tech companies in banning libertarians Alex Jones and Daniel McAdams of the Ron Paul Institute from multiple platforms, as well as other libertarian groups.

Not only have the last two years demonstrated bald faced lying on the part of big tech now revealed as giant spying and censoring operations, Facebook and friends were intended all along to be in this position of censorship to fully control all narratives – political, moral, aesthetic, cultural, as well as election manipulation and market dominance.

The United States is a pop cultural superpower. One can debate if this is for good or for worse – but what is almost indisputable is the amount of resources government institutions ranging from universities to the military and intelligence services place on steering the direction of cultural icons such as musicians and movie stars.

Today Jay Dyer, known for his incisive analysis on propaganda embedded in American films and music, joins us for a discussion on the so called counter-cultural revolution in the 1960s music scene centered around Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. What appears to be an organic, anti-establishment movement led by artists such as Jim Morrison of The Doors is, upon closer examination, co-opted and steered by the very organizations that they publicly condemn. In America, controlled opposition would appear to take many forms. Brought to you by Thermidor Magazine and the Myth 20c Podcast.

The US Department of State announced in a statement today the closure of the office of the General Delegation of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Washington, D.C., located at 1732 Wisconsin Ave NW.

“The PLO has not taken steps to advance the start of direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel. To the contrary, PLO leadership has condemned a US peace plan they have not yet seen and refused to engage with the U.S. government with respect to peace efforts and otherwise,” the Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said in the official statement.

Here is the official response by the head of the PLO General Delegation, Ambassador Dr. Husam Zomlot:

We condemn in the strongest terms, the US administration’s decision to close the Palestinian mission to the US. However, we are not surprised.

Such a reckless act confirms that the administration is blindly executing Israel’s “wish list,” which starts with shutting down Palestinian diplomatic representation in the US.

The administration’s reasoning for such an act is the refusal of the Palestinian leadership and the PLO Delegation to the US to cooperate with the so-called “peace efforts” and our actions to hold Israel accountable by referring it to the International Criminal Court. We stand firm in our decision not to cooperate in this ongoing campaign to liquidate our rights and cause. Our rights are not for sale and we will block any attempts at bullying and blackmailing us to forgo our legitimate and internationally endorsed rights.

Those who have pushed for such an act are taking a direct aim not only against the Palestinian people and the historic US-Palestinian relationship, but also the prospects for peace in the Middle East and the integrity of the international political and legal system.

The US administration is committing to protect Israel from unlawful acts, and provide it with full immunity to kill the two state-solution, and continue violating basic human and national rights of the people of Palestine, while attacking and undermining the international system of legitimacy and legality.

However, this confirms for us that we are on the right track. We will step up our efforts to hold Israel accountable under international law, continue building international alliances for peace, double our efforts to reach out to the American people as we witness the transformational change in American public opinion in support of the Palestinian cause and our legitimate rights.

While today is a dark day for peace in the Middle East, for multilateralism, and the integrity of the international political and legal system, we will continue our struggle to pursue all possible legal and political means to achieve peace, independence, and our internationally enshrined rights."	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PLO-DC-e1536617346938.jpg

Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) collectively penned an open letter to U.S. President Donald Trump admonishing him to speak now and with authority for Russia and the world to hear – telling the jihadists embedded in Syria that “theirs is a lost cause.”

In the VIPS letter, a range of issues are addressed including the dangerous prospect of “direct Russian-U.S. hostilities” and the unclear nature of U.S. leadership on Syria policy, in particular the role of John Bolton.

The full letter is included below and was originally published to Consortium News:

As Syrian forces backed by Russia launch the final showdown in Syria against jihadist extremists in Idlib province, the potential for a U.S.-Russia confrontation has never been greater, as VIPS warns in this memo to the president. September 9, 2018

MEMORANDUM FOR: The President

FROM: Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity

SUBJECT: Moscow Has Upped the Ante in Syria

Mr. President:

We are concerned that you may not have been adequately briefed on the upsurge of hostilities in northwestern Syria, where Syrian armed forces with Russian support have launched a full-out campaign to take back the al-Nusra/al-Qaeda/ISIS- infested province of Idlib. The Syrians will almost certainly succeed, as they did in late 2016 in Aleppo. As in Aleppo, it will mean unspeakable carnage, unless someone finally tells the insurgents theirs is a lost cause.

That someone is you. The Israelis, Saudis, and others who want unrest to endure are egging on the insurgents, assuring them that you, Mr. President, will use US forces to protect the insurgents in Idlib, and perhaps also rain hell down on Damascus. We believe that your senior advisers are encouraging the insurgents to think in those terms, and that your most senior aides are taking credit for your recent policy shift from troop withdrawal from Syria to indefinite war.

Big Difference This Time

Russian missile-armed naval and air units are now deployed in unprecedented numbers to engage those tempted to interfere with Syrian and Russian forces trying to clean out the terrorists from Idlib. We assume you have been briefed on that — at least to some extent. More important, we know that your advisers tend to be dangerously dismissive of Russian capabilities and intentions.

We do not want you to be surprised when the Russians start firing their missiles. The prospect of direct Russian-U.S. hostilities in Syria is at an all-time high. We are not sure you realize that.

The situation is even more volatile because Kremlin leaders are not sure who is calling the shots in Washington. This is not the first time that President Putin has encountered such uncertainty (see brief Appendix below). This is, however, the first time that Russian forces have deployed in such numbers into the area, ready to do battle. The stakes are very high.

We hope that John Bolton has given you an accurate description of his acerbic talks with his Russian counterpart in Geneva a few weeks ago. In our view, it is a safe bet that the Kremlin is uncertain whether Bolton faithfully speaks in your stead, or speaks INSTEAD of you.

The best way to assure Mr. Putin that you are in control of U.S. policy toward Syria would be for you to seek an early opportunity to speak out publicly, spelling out your intentions. If you wish wider war, Bolton has put you on the right path.

If you wish to cool things down, you may wish to consider what might be called a pre-emptive ceasefire. By that we mean a public commitment by the Presidents of the U.S. and Russia to strengthen procedures to preclude an open clash between U.S. and Russian armed forces. We believe that, in present circumstances, this kind of extraordinary step is now required to head off wider war.

Sept 17, 2016: U.S. Air Force bombs fixed Syrian Army positions killing between 64 and 84 Syrian army troops; about 100 others wounded — evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia.

Sept 26, 2016: We can assume that what Lavrov has told his boss in private is close to his uncharacteristically blunt words on Russian NTV on Sept. 26. (In public remarks bordering on the insubordinate, senior Pentagon officials a few days earlier had showed unusually open skepticism regarding key aspects of the Kerry-Lavrov agreement – like sharing intelligence with the Russians (a key provision of the deal approved by both Obama and Putin). Here’s what Lavrov said on Sept 26:

“My good friend John Kerry … is under fierce criticism from the US military machine. Despite the fact that, as always, [they] made assurances that the US Commander in Chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin), apparently the military does not really listen to the Commander in Chief.”

Lavrov went beyond mere rhetoric. He also specifically criticized JCS Chairman Joseph Dunford for telling Congress that he opposed sharing intelligence with Russia, “after the agreements concluded on direct orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Barack Obama stipulated that they would share intelligence. … It is difficult to work with such partners. …”

Oct 27, 2016: Putin speaks at the Valdai International Discussion Club

At Valdai Russian President Putin spoke of the “feverish” state of international relations and lamented: “My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.” He complained about “people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice” and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a “common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.”

Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) is made up of former intelligence officers, diplomats, military officers and congressional staffers. The organization, founded in 2002, was among the first critics of Washington’s justifications for launching a war against Iraq. VIPS advocates a US foreign and national security policy based on genuine national interests rather than contrived threats promoted for largely political reasons. An archive of VIPS memoranda is available at Consortiumnews.com.

21st Century Wire says…

In a new report released on Thursday, President Trump ‘does a 180’ on his previous policy against pursuing regime change in Syria – now agreeing to “a new strategy for an indefinitely extended military, diplomatic and economic effort there, according to senior State Department officials.”



Regime change may be back on the table, but in reality it never left with U.S. illegal and permanent occupation of Syria.

While Trump’s prior positions on regime change may have signaled a shift in regime change aspirations, U.S. military actions on the ground in Syria have always aligned with overthrowing the democratically elected Bashar al-Assad and his administration.

For evidence of this you need look no further than the troop build-up and presence in the southeastern part of Syria, specifically near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders in the area of al-Tanf, where a U.S. military base was established (illegally) in 2016 for the stated purpose of countering ISIS and training Syrian opposition groups in their fight against ISIS. However, these ‘moderate rebels’ are not fighting ISIS, instead they are free to run amok across the country whether under direct supervision of U.S. forces or not.

In al-Tanf, the U.S. military has permanently established a 55KM ‘de-confliction zone’ along a stretch of the Baghdad-Damascus highway within the borders of the sovereign country of Syria. U.S. forces operate with impunity here and have strategically positioned themselves to also monitor and beat back, if needed, Iranian-backed forces – essentially playing the role of occupier, judge, jury and executioner on foreign soil in this region.

And what about ISIS? If you believe all the government and corporate media propaganda, then you probably still think that ISIS is entirely a grassroots Islamic ideological movement – with no connection to foreign agencies like the CIA, Britain’s MI6, Turkish (NATO) intelligence, Saudi intelligence, Israeli intelligence, or Pakistan’s ISI. Not only would you still be wrong, but US coalition support for ISIS is an “open dirty secret” that continues to this day:

Right from the beginning, the conflict in Syria was no civil war, but a US-imposed proxy war. In the process, Washington recruited, trained, armed, guided, protected and transported ISIS militias in a ruthless effort to overthrow the Syrian government. — Doug Bell (@realDougBell) September 6, 2018

SEE ALSO: Top 10 Curious Circumstances That Led to the Rise of ISIS

If you need even further proof of the open-ended and perpetual nature of this occupation in Syria, look no further than today’s reaction by U.S. officials in response to Russia’s warning of pending attack on Syrian militants in the al-Tanf area:

“The United States does not seek to fight the government of Syria or any groups that may be providing it support. However, if attacked, the United States will not hesitate to use necessary and proportionate force to defend US, coalition or partner forces,” a defense official told CNN.

U.S. officials are claiming a ‘right of self-defense’ in Syria as illegal occupiers of the country? This is in direct conflict with sanity and international law.

So for the last time I will make an appeal to sanity and international law: this is exactly why the US must end its illegal occupation of Northeastern #Syria. US position is a CASUS BELLI. Pure and simple. Any questions? https://t.co/itXZ1bOjjm — Patrick Henningsen (@21WIRE) September 7, 2018

Vanessa Beeley

21st Century Wire

According to reports in CBS News, a number of members of the pro-Syrian-regime-change coalition, including the UK and Holland have lobbied U.S President, Donald Trump, to evacuate the White Helmets from Syria to avoid their possible elimination in the battles to liberate the Southern provinces of Syria that are occupied by Nusra Front who power multiply the ubiquitous armed “moderates” favoured by the US Coalition.

“CBS News has learned the question of how to extract the emergency workers was raised with President Trump in multiple conversations with allied countries on the sidelines of the NATO summit. The Netherlands, U.K., France, Canada and Germany are scrambling to find a way to save the lives of an estimated 1,000 volunteers and their family members. Around 300 of them are considered to be in imminent danger.”

The UK are primary creators and fundraisers for the Al Qaeda (and splinter groups) auxiliary and Theresa May was quick to leap to their defence:

“Prime Minister Theresa May personally brought up the emergency issue during her meeting with Mr. Trump in the U.K. Formally known as the Syrian Civil Defense group, the White Helmets expect to be marked as resistance targets and slaughtered by Assad’s forces, which are backed by Iranian and Russian firepower.”

This is not the first time that the White Helmets have been given such high level protection by the members of the “International Community” who have been waging an illegal war against Syria for more than seven years. On the 16th March 2018, the permanent Syrian representative at the UN, Dr Bashar Al Jaafari informed the UN Security Council:

“He warned that giving the opportunity for terrorist groups, including the so-called “White Helmets” which are affiliated to Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist organization, to use the Security Council as a podium constitutes a flagrant violation of UNSC resolutions, particularly those related to combating terrorism, adding “the biggest scandal is that a UN agency operating in Damascus demanded the evacuation of 76 members of White Helmets from Eastern Ghouta, while paying no attention to the lives of thousands of civilians.”

On the 17th March, NATO-aligned, Soros funded NGO – Human Rights Watch reported:

“On March 17, Human Rights Watch received a distress call from a member of the Syrian Civil Defense who told Human Rights Watch that he and 19 colleagues, five of whom are wounded, have been surrounded by government forces. According to him, in addition, there are 90 members of the Syrian Civil Defense and their relatives trapped in a second location, and they are all requesting safe passage to non-government-held areas. He said they fear retaliation, including summary execution, when the government takes the area.”

It appears that NATO member states have brought pressure to bear upon Trump prior to his meeting with Putin next week in the hope that Trump can persuade Putin to spare the lives of their most valuable asset, the White Helmets – who have been single-handedly responsible for producing and nurturing the majority of chemical/chlorine weapon attack narratives, including Khan Sheikhoun and Douma that has now been proven highly contentious by the OPCW interim report.

21st Century Wire article: False Flag Fail: How Syrian Civilians Derailed White Helmet Chemical Stunt in Eastern Ghouta

The alarmist reports from the financiers of the White Helmets among NATO member states, include claims that the Syrian government will execute the members of this terrorist aligned group when liberation of the southern region is completed. These claims ignore the fact that, in East Aleppo and Eastern Ghouta, the White Helmets fled alongside the armed groups on the green buses that evacuated them to Idlib.

“This effort says we are in the evacuation phase. It is an admission that the regime is going to regain control of the country and the White Helmets can’t remain,” said a U.S. government official.” ~ from CBS report.

Trump has signalled the withdrawl of US presence inside Syria and an end to the illegal US occupation of the North East of Syria. The requested removal of the White Helmets is another admission of this group being a member of the regime-change-coalition apparatus as had been previously stated by US State Department spokesperson, Heather Nauert in an extraordinary press briefing:

…

As with East Aleppo and Eastern Ghouta liberations from extremist armed group occupation – these NATO member states and their lock-step media will not mention the scenes of celebration that are emerging from Daraa and the surrounding countryside following full liberation by the Syrian Arab Army and allies, including the Russian Amnesty and Reconciliation teams who will have negotiated the evacuations of the armed groups and their sidekicks, the White Helmets:

No further proof is needed that the White Helmets are an integral part of the US Coalition regime change machinery and that deals have been struck to protect this primary propaganda construct that has consistently advocated “no fly zones” and called upon the international community to intervene militarily on behalf of the faux-revolutionary forces that have brutalised the Syrian people for more than seven years. Perhaps Trump genuinely intends to withdraw all assets from inside Syria – if that is the case where will the White Helmets go? Will they morph into a “security force” to “rebuild Syria” as has been suggested in a number of reports?

White Helmets Exit strategy – resettlement into Europe https://t.co/YCIpjHw1Z5 — Friedemann Wo (@FriedemannWo) July 15, 2018

The White Helmets do not stay to help the civilians, while claiming to have rescued 115,000 since their establishment in Turkey and Jordan in 2013. They move with the armed groups with no regard for the civilian population they leave behind.

Much is made of the alleged Russian “propaganda campaign” to discredit this UK/US hybrid-war group of narrative builders but very little has been said about an informed Syrian population who understand the part played by this group in maintaining the war and the suffering of millions inside and outside Syria. It is Syria that will reject the White Helmets and it is Syrians who should be heard when they accuse this pseudo first response outfit of war crimes and child abduction, among a number of other atrocities they are accused of having committed or enabled:

“Civil defence” (White Helmets) were supposed to help wounded civilians, but NO! if any of the terrorists were wounded they would run to their aid, but civilians – NO. It was very rare, if they (White Helmets) weren’t going to film it, they wouldn’t come.

When the camera was there they would run around as if they were helping people.

Our neighbor in Zamalka – we left on Friday, but on the Previous Wednesday, there were strikes. The ceiling collapsed onto the woman, and her children. We – the women – pulled 3 kids from under the wreckage, they were alive, but the mother remained there, from the morning till the evening. Nobody came to help. We witnessed that. Her husband kept running around asking them for help, they said “NO”.

They (White Helmets) blamed us for leaving the basement. We were dying in these basements. The smell, alone, could kill you. We were sitting on the floor, nothing there, not even toilets, we needed water, they had given us water tanks with taps, but when the taps were broken, they didn’t fix them. We had to go far away to find water.

When the woman was trapped under the ceiling, they (White Helmets) didn’t come to help her. She stayed there till it was a bit before dusk when groups of people came and got her out…in pieces.” ~ Sabah Al Mushref.

…

UPDATE 16.7.2018: A recent CNN report on the predicament of the White Helmets claims that diplomatic sources have told them that the U.K, Germany and Canada will be the countries to receive refugee White Helmets. This is worrying blowback as these terrorist affiliates will be absorbed into the societies whose governments created them and sustained them. Will they be redirected? Will they be utilised to further discredit and vilify the Syrian government, SAA and allies? Will they be expected to train new teams of interventionist instruments for future campaigns? Will our Fire Services be expected to employ them, despite cut backs and austerity measures imposed by this Tory government?

Too many questions and too many consequences of the UK FCO financing of yet another regime change war that has failed and is now coming home to roost.

Nepotism and corruption are nothing new, particularly in the corporate or political sphere. In 2013 Boris Johnson’s brother Jo was appointed head of No 10’s policy unit under David Cameron. As the Guardian article noted, this appointment did not appear to be a crucial necessity: “it’s not as if anyone had complained of a dire shortage of Johnsons in the public eye, or of Old Etonians in the cabinet.”

Cameron and Johnson are both “Old Etonians” and shared the notoriety of being members of the elite Bullingdon Club at Oxford, whose members were renonwned for ostentatious displays of wealth, raucous, hard-drinking dinners and the exclusion of women from their ranks.

I am not going to dwell upon the vagaries of such clubs and networks that united the establishment elite into an exclusive consortium of wealth and privilege that has served them well throughout their careers and countless falls from grace.

However, now the White Helmets are involved believe it or not in a way that fully exposes the nepotism and corruption at the highest levels of policy making and intervention into the affairs of a sovereign nation, in this case, Syria.

Mayday Rescue

Mayday Rescue is the allegedly Netherlands based NGO funded by a number of the governments that have a very transparent objective of regime change in Syria. Mayday Rescue was established by James Le Mesurier, a British ex-Sandhurst private security “expert”, who had previously set up the White Helmets in Turkey and Jordan while employed by the ARK Group DMCC.

Both ARK Group and Mayday Rescue are funded by the UK FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) Conflict Stability and Security Fund that coincidentally was created in 2015 and allowed Mayday Rescue to take over the financing of the White Helmets, providing valuable plausible deniability for the government of “Global Britain” – the term coined by Theresa May and echoed by Boris Johnson. Prior to the creation of the CSSF, it appears that the ARK Group’s establishment of the White Helmets was funded by CSSF’s predecessor, the Syria Conflict Pool.

The CEO of ARK, Alistair Harris, also works in collaboration with the UK’s National Security complex. He is also CEO of The Stabilisation Network DMCC, based in Dubai, which is listed as one of the CSSF approved contractors. Both Harris and Le Mesurier have been awarded the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) – Harris for services in Lebanon. Le Mesurier was rewarded for “services to Syria Civil Defence and the protection of civilians in Syria“.

Both men, therefore, have close ties to the UK National Security apparatus and an expertise in implementing security solutions, working in private sector military circles and imposing “stabilisation” projects upon UK FCO designated nations, including Syria, Yemen, Palestine, Afghanistan, Lebanon and in the case of Le Mesurier, Kosovo. Both men work out of Dubai. The initial register of Mayday Rescue was in Dubai before it was relocated to the more neutral Netherlands and Le Mesurier works for Bush’s ex-terror advisor, the Terror Czar himself, Richard A. Clark, at Good Harbour International in Dubai.

The links between these players in the Global Britain subcontracter market are clearly defined.

The Eton Mess



Andrew Gilmour with Ban Ki-Moon (UN Press)

In October 2016 a young man left Oxford University and walked straight into a position as Operations manager at Mayday Rescue. His name is Archie Gilmour. He is the son of Andrew Gilmour – “United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today announced the appointment of Andrew Gilmour of the United Kingdom as Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights and Head of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in New York.”

According to the UN Press release:

“Since joining the United Nations in 1989, he has held a variety of positions at United Nations Headquarters and in the field, including in Afghanistan-Pakistan, Kosovo, State of Palestine and West Africa. In recent years, he has served as Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Iraq, and later, in South Sudan. Prior to his current position, he was the Representative of the Secretary-General in Belgrade.”

Perhaps more importantly, Gilmour was at Eton College with Boris Johnson and then they were reunited at Balliol College, Oxford:

“Johnson arrived at Eton as a scholar in the autumn of 1977, aged 13. He was part of the school’s intellectual elite, accommodated in a separate house and marked out by being made to wear gowns. By the time he left, at the end of 1982, he had become a commanding figure with a reputation as a star performer. His speciality was forgetting his lines. One of his friends, Andrew Gilmour, remembers Johnson reciting the first page of Evelyn Waugh’s Decline and Fall, which begins: “Mr Sniggs, the Junior Dean, and Mr Postlethwaite, the Domestic Bursar . . .” ~ Daily Mail

Johnson’s return to Balliol in May 2017 was not the victorious homecomeing to his alma mater that he may have wished for:

Boris wanted a quiet visit to his old college for lunch today. Students found out and had other ideas. pic.twitter.com/2gCtglTyXW — Novara Media (@novaramedia) May 28, 2017

Archie Gilmour of Mayday Rescue is also Boris Johnson’s Godson. The nepotism circle is closed.

Why Should this Matter?

It should matter very much. Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson is responsible for the continued presence of Global Britain’s troops in Syria on the extraordinary pretext of “defending Iraq from ISIS” – based upon Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon’s reply to Baroness Cox on 22nd February 2018:

Johnson has publicly heaped praise upon the White Helmets despite the growing mountain of evidence that they are embedded with a number of terrorist (Al Qaeda) and extremist factions inside Syria and are responsible for producing the bulk of the propaganda that serves to criminalise the Syrian government and its allies. Johnson has increased funding to this sectarian group of British produced and trained pseudo-“humanitarians” and the UK FCO has recently admitted to financing the White Helmets almost £ 39m since their creation in 2013.

…

The Foreign Secretary of Global Britain, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights and Head of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in New York and an Operations Manager at the White Helmet-financing Mayday Rescue are intrinsically linked, when viewed through the elite network prism that has secured jobs for the boys for centuries. Old Etonians and Oxford graduates united behind an organisation destined to be an integral part of the Syria whose future does not include the elected President, Bashar Al Assad, according to these Global Britain acolytes.

Where will complaints from the Syrian people against the White Helmets go within the UN? They will be swept into the memory hole that will secure Archie’s future in the Global Britain security and stabilisation industry. No dissent against the White Helmets will be tolerated by the Eton guild. Corruption at this level should not surprise us, nepotism should not come as a shock but the benefits reaped by the initiated come at the expense of innocent people whose blood is being shed while the champagne glasses clink over another appointment made by the privileged for the privileged.

Archie Gilmour is very unlikely to question the hidden agenda of the White Helmets, he would prefer not to derail his own career path in favour of truth, not when his Godfather and father are a part of the apparatus that requires the image of the White Helmets to remain untarnished and credible, both in Syria and in future destabilization zones where Archie will deploy his rebranded stabilization teams to repair the damage brought about by Global Britain’s colonialist zeal.

This is a simple story, a revealing one, and one that goes to the heart of the corrosion of our society in the West. Our institutions, including the UN, are owned and controlled by those who will exploit their founding principles for their own gains, not for the “humantarian” principles they claim to uphold. These plutocrats are violently inflicting a faux “democracy” upon nations who courageously defend their right to decide their own future according to the “international” laws put in place by those who now violate them at will because they know the establishment has their back.

On the other hand:

“On the 6th of March, in Hamouriya, we decided to protest against Failaq Al Rahman and we raised the Syrian flag. We marched against the terrorist occupation. They (Failaq Al Rahman) and the White Helmets were preparing a chemical attack which they intended to blame on the Syrian Arab Army as they closed in on the militants. They were furious with us for our march and for raising the Syrian flag, because it ruined their plans” ~ Ibrahim Omar Toumeh, resident of Hamouriya, 45 years old.

Some weeks after the liberation of Eastern Ghouta which had been occupied by a series of militant and extremist groups backed and armed by a variety of NATO-member-states, Gulf States and protected by Israel, I had the opportunity to interview civilians from all districts, both on the ground in Ghouta and in the nearby IDP (Internally Displaced People) camps that consisted of highly organised education centres for children, clean single-floor buildings that housed extended families, and that provided clean water, electricity, food and essential supplies to the thousands of temporary residents.

I met Ibrahim Omar Toumeh in Harjalleh camp. He had arrived from Hamouriya one week previously, with his entire family. He and his family were keen to talk about their experiences living under Failaq Al Rahman rule (Al Qaeda affiliate) in their neighborhood. The usual stories of deprivation, imprisonment, sectarian brutality were recounted. I was told that the White Helmets worked as “one hand” with the terrorist factions throughout Eastern Ghouta:

“White Helmets worked everywhere, they had points in all places – Harasta, Douma, Misrata, Otaya and they had centres in other sectors also alongside Failaq Al Rahman brigade (Nusra Front affiliate). They had points in Jobar also. Everywhere in Ghouta. They worked with terrorist groups like Jaish Al Islam, Failaq Al Rahman, Fair Al-Ummah (Dawn of the Nations).”

~ Mahmoud Al Khaled, resident of Hamouriya.

Toumeh described what he believed happened in Hamouriya on the 6th March 2018 and the days leading up to that date. He told me that at this time, the Syrian Arab Army were rapidly advancing towards Hamouriya and civilians were beginning to feel empowered and more able to protest the presence of Failaq Al Rahman and their associates, the White Helmets and other militant groups.

“On the 6th of March a major conference was due to be held in the UN. We always knew about these conferences because of the co-ordinators in Hamouriya that worked with people inside the UN. On the 4th and 5th of March, the White Helmets and the armed groups began to gather bodies in the hospital. They brought these bodies from everywhere, and they brought them to the place where they would stage an attack. By the 5th, they had around 30 bodies in the hospital and the White Helmets started to take photographs.”

~ Ibrahim Toumeh

Watch this video of Hamouriya residents raising the Syrian flag on 6th March 2018:

…

Toumeh continued:

“On the 6th March, we knew the Syrian Arab Army was getting closer. A group of us decided to march in the streets of Hamouriya and to raise the Syrian flag in solidarity with the Army. We knew the armed groups (Failaq Al Rahman) were betting on a western military intervention with reinforcements from the U.S base at Al Tanf. The armed groups told us that there were even ISIS terrorists from Deir Ezzor among these groups in Al Tanf.”

[EDIT: Investigative journalist, Elijah Magnier, had written about the US secret plans to divert militants from Al Tanf camp to reinforce the extremist groups in control of Eastern Ghouta, in his article: The US Secret Plan on Damascus Foiled – The Russian Role Before the US/UK/France Attack Revealed]

When I checked the 6th March in the UN calendar there had, indeed, been a high level discussion on Syria. “The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, attended a meeting today with representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Russian Federation, and the Republic of Turkey, hosted by the Russian Federation at its permanent mission in Geneva.”

Toumeh then told me:

“The armed groups were always telling us that the West would intervene and help them to conquer Damascus. After six years of their lies, we knew it was not going to happen. We were human shields for them, nothing more. We were fed up with their lies, so we raised the Syrian flag and we marched to tell them (Failaq Al Rahman) to leave Hamouriya.

About an hour after we raised the flag, one of the head co-ordinators came to us with another person and he told us that we had ruined their plans. I asked why. They told me they had released “news” of a chemical attack the night before, saying 30 people had been killed. When we raised the flag around 3pm or 3.30pm the day after, we ruined it for them”

I asked Toumeh why he thought they said it was ruined, he smiled and then replied:

“They told me – ‘how can an area get hit by chemical weapons by the Syrian government and then hours later residents in the same area, are raising the Syrian flag?’. They also told me we had ruined their communications with the UN and that there would be no intervention from Al Tanf after all. The main co-ordinator’s name was Abdulmueeh Hommus.

They wanted to present the “chemical attack” on the day the SAA entered Hamouriya, you see? The next day Failaq Al Rahman issued a Fatwa against all of us. All of us were sentenced to death. They brought one of their prisoners, they wrapped him in the Syrian flag and they shot him dead with three bullets to threaten us. We didnt care. We co-ordinated with the Army and they helped us to leave Hamouriya.”

The following video shows some of the Failaq Al Rahman reprisals against the civilian protestors in Hamouriya. WATCH:

…

Many reports on the SAA military campaign centering on Hamouriya confirm that the final liberation of this town was imminent. According to SouthFront’s war report on March 7th:

On March 6, the White Helments, a notorious organization operating in areas controlled by al-Qaeda-linked militants, reported that government forces had conducted a new chlorine gas attack in Eastern Ghouta allegedly injuring 30 people. It’s interesting to note that reports about alleged chemical attacks started appearing during a rapid advance by the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and its allies against Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda), Ahrar al-Sham, Jaish al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman.

By March 7, SAA troops had liberated a large area, including farms near the towns of Misraba and Beit Sawa. The town of Hammouriyah had reportedly surrendered to the SAA and government troops had started entering it.” (Emphasis added)

The White Helmet twitter feed confirms their claim of a chlorine gas attack in Hamouriya on the 6th March:

Following a Regime #chlorine gas attack in #Hamorieh city, more than 30 suffocation cases including women, children, #CivilDefense volunteers, only hours after the Aid convoy arrived and left #EasternGhouta . This is attack number 8 in 2018 pic.twitter.com/IlbByRMP2d — The White Helmets (@SyriaCivilDef) March 5, 2018

Toumeh is not the only one to have spoken to me about this staged chemical attack.

32 year old Mohammed Al Khatib is also from Hamouriya. I interviewed him in April 2018. He told me:

“The chemical attack was going to be staged to the East of the town in the direction of the Syrian Arab Army. The day before, the White Helmets started to bring bodies to the area, to the hospital. The media groups working with the armed groups also came. They started to film and photograph the bodies. There were many children among the dead. At this time all the medical centres were out of service. Only the White Helmets were bringing bodies from all over Hamouriya to this one centre so it would look as if they had been killed in this attack. On the 6th March after we had marched and raised the flag, we were approached by some of the White Helmet members. They were very angry with us. They told us they wanted to force the West to intervene on their behalf but now their plan would not work and it was our fault. This was the first time we saw them actually preparing a movie against our country. Usually they would make us go into the basement until they had finished filming an event.”

Mohammed a father and grandfather from Hamouriya was among those severely punished by Failaq Al Rahman for raising the Syrian flag on the 6th March 2018. I have already told his harrowing story in a previous article:

SEE ALSO: Voices From Eastern Ghouta, Video Testimonies.

The Main Players

When I first heard these testimonies which were echoed by a number of other witnesses from Hamouriya but not in so much detail, I began to piece together the events of the 6th March 2018 and found that much of what had been described to me fell into place alongside tweets and reports from the various Western backed organisations on the ground in Eastern Ghouta.

Those organisations were headed up by the U.S Coalition multi-million-dollar financed White Helmets, with a history of being the preferred source for evidence of previous alleged chemical weapon attacks, including Khan Sheikhoun one year ago in April 2017.

The reliance on the White Helmets to provide the narratives to corroborate UK and U.S government policy in Syria has been undeniably demonstrated by a UK FCO document outlining funding for the White Helmets via the Conflict Stability and Security Fund (CSSF).

SEE ALSO: White Helmets: ‘Humanitarians’ and the ‘Moderate’ Bomb Factory in Saqba, Eastern Ghouta.

Toumeh had told me the demonstrations and flag raising took place around 3pm in the afternoon. The first announcements of an SAA chlorine attack in Hamouriya began to appear from late on the night of the 5th of March (depending on time zone) and then during the day of the 6th March as seen in the White Helmet tweet I have included in the article.

The media and advocacy manager for the White Helmets, Asaad Hanna, was among the first to signal the alleged chlorine attack in Hamouriya. It is worth bearing in mind that according to his own CV, Hanna also is a contributor at Chatham House the British Government-linked policy institute, The Washington Times and TRT World, Turkish state media.

Hanna is a researcher at the Washington-based Toran Centre, where Professor Scott Lucas of EA Worldview is also a consultant. Dima Moussa is also a researcher at the Toran centre – and Moussa is the newly elected Vice-President of the Syrian National Coalition Of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces (formerly known as the SNC, the US-created ‘opposition government’ in exile) and had previously worked for ARK Group and Mayday Rescue, according to her LinkedIn page.

The founder of the White Helmets, James Le Mesurier worked for ARK Group when he established the White Helmets in Turkey, Moussa was with ARK during this period. Le Mesurier then went on to set up Mayday Rescue, ostensibly in the Netherlands (Wayback machine shows the Mayday address in Dubai) as an intermediary to receive and transfer funds from the UK FCO CSSF to the White Helmets. During her time as Operations Manager at Mayday Rescue, Moussa was clearly involved in the day to day support for the White Helmets.

I will go into greater depth about these connections in a subsequent article but this information demonstrates how closely knit these organisations are and how they form a network that is capable of promulgating Syrian narratives favourable to the US Coalition interventionist road map – rapidly and across a diverse and extensive information base that includes corporate media, think tanks and government-aligned institutions, thus ensuring their influence over policy decisions by governments such as the UK and U.S, already heavily invested in the “regime change” operation in Syria.

The Ayman Asfari -funded “Violations Documentation Centre” (VDC) put out a ‘witness’ statement on Twitter on the 6th March:

Ayman Asfari also provided seed funding and ongoing support for Syria Campaign who effectively run the publicity campaign for the White Helmets and has succeeded in presenting these Al Qaeda (and associated extremist groups) affiliates as “impartial, unarmed and neutral humanitarians” for five years since their creation in March 2013, in Turkey.

VDC had previously used one of the more notorious White Helmets as an “expert” witness for another alleged chemical weapon attack in Sarmin, Idlib in March 2015. Muawiya Agha Hassan is perhaps best known for his criminal participation in the torture and execution of two SAA prisoners of war in Khan Touman, Aleppo in April 2016.

In the early hours of the morning of the 7th March Dr Zaher Sahloul of SAMS (Syrian American Medical Society) tweeted the statement from the so-called Syrian Interim Government retracting claims of a “chlorine attack” which ties in with the statements from Toumeh and Khatib – that their march and protests had derailed plans by the White Helmets and Failaq Al Rahman – to stage a chlorine attack event:

It looks that the reported “#Chlorine” attack in Ghouta yesterday was due to exposure to irritating fumes from high potency explosives after all pic.twitter.com/h0NeFPZhrq — Dr. Zaher Sahloul (@sahloul) March 6, 2018

The VDC tweet had been picked up by Syrian “armed opposition” and White Helmet supporter, Professor Scott Lucas of EA Worldview (consultant at the Toran Centre) in an article published the same day, the 6th March. The information was only updated in a separate report on the 7th March when Lucas confirmed that a chemical attack had not actually taken place in Hamouriya on the 6th March:

“As the residents of Hamouriya surrendered, the opposition’s Health Directorate said a Monday “gas attack” was actually fumes from high-potency explosives.”

When I challenged Lucas on why he had not corrected the first article rather than burying the retraction in a ‘follow-up’ article, he responded with familiar defensive avoidance tactics:

Now your turn: please address questions you avoided on Wed. 1. Name #Assad regime officials who enabled your ""journalism"" in #Syria 2. Provide any evidence for yr falsehood ""kidnapped children by #WhiteHelmets"" in #EastGhouta#Syria #FunWithAssadTrolls — Scott Lucas (@ScottLucas_EA) June 28, 2018

Joyce Karam of The National was another one to run with the story literally as it appeared on the Twitter pages of the moderate extremist support groups and individuals, such as Mohamad Katoub, advocacy manager for SAMS – based in… Gaziantep, Turkey:

6 children, 4 women, and 2 men were reported to be contaminated by a #chlorine attack in Hamorieh in #Ghouta tonight. All victims arrived with moderate symptoms, and no fatality was reported. This is attack number 8 in 2018 and 198 since 2012 — Mohamad Katoub (@MhdKatoub) March 5, 2018

The National alludes to the threat of U.S. intervention if ‘another chemical attack’ is perceived to have been carried out by the SAA:

If the attack is proven, it comes at a tricky time for the debate in Washington. On Monday, the Washington Post reported that “the Trump administration has considered new military action against the Syrian government in response to reports of ongoing chemical weapons use.” (Emphasis added)

Al Araby UK also ran the story based upon the White Helmet accounts and has not retracted it to my knowledge, the article is still available on their website and has not been updated.

France Threatens Intervention

Bearing in mind Toumeh’s claims that these “chlorine attacks” were staged in an attempt by Failaq Al Rahman and the White Helmets to pressure the West to intervene on their behalf, it was not surprising to see that France was posturing wildly as Eastern Ghouta was being liberated and the Western proxy grip on Damascus was finally being prised apart.

On the 8th March:

“If the use of chemical weapons were found, verified, attributed and the use of the chemical weapon left people dead,” France would take “intervention measures to prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons,”

– Jean-Yves Le Drian, French Foreign Minister.

On the 12th March:

“The day we have, in particular in tandem with our American partners, irrefutable proof that the red line was crossed — namely the chemical weapons were used to lethal effect — we will do what the Americans themselves did moreover a few months ago; we would put ourselves in position to proceed with targeted strikes,”

– French President, Francois Macron.

The race was on to fulfill this prophecy. Nothing could have given greater encouragement for the US Coalition assets on the ground in Syria to produce a chemical attack provocation than such bellicose rhetoric from Macron and Trump.

Immediately after the retraction of the 6th March chlorine attack, another chlorine attack was allegedly carried out in Hamouriya on the 7th March which was picked up by The Guardian – Kareem Shaheen in Istanbul, to be precise – based upon testimony from the “rescue workers” which we must presume to be the White Helmets although they are not named by Shaheen.

“They said 29 people, including 15 children, were admitted to a medical centre with breathing problems after a suspected toxic gas attack on the towns of Hamoryah and Saqba.” (Emphasis added)

A familiar White Helmet figure provided a dramatic statement for Al Jazeera.

“Yesterday night was the darkest and most horrific night ever. They used phosphorus, napalm, cluster bombs and chlorine gas,” Ammar al-Selmo, a volunteer aid worker for the Syrian Civil Defence, told Al Jazeera by phone from the opposition-held enclave.”

In September 2016, Al-Selmo provided ‘evidence’ of the alleged Russian bombing of a humanitarian convoy west of Aleppo City. Investigative journalist, Gareth Porter, masterfully deconstructed this evidence in a later report.

The following video was produced by @Syricide on Twitter based upon Al Selmo’s statements in September 2016. There is a remarkable similarity in sensationalism between the 2016 and 2017 statements. WATCH:

…

Conclusions

Media outlets in the West have no issue with a rush to judgement regarding “suspected” chemical attacks when the source is a part of the approved team on the ground in Syria, dominated by the White Helmets. The stream of chemical weapon reports are repeated in a manner that barely raises any doubt over their credibility. Questions are not asked, and even when the narrative is then retracted, an attack one day later is reported without the caveat that victim symptoms may be the result of smoke inhalation, rather than chlorine or other toxic gas.

The treadmill of “chemical attacks” must be maintained because that is what will instigate U.S coalition intervention, according to the U.S Coalition. Journalists should be mapping the correlation between SAA military advances, the uptick in U.S allied belligerence towards Syria and the increase in claims of chemical attacks by the extremist groups benefiting from U.S intervention. Of course this is not what happens. The western media journalists literally copy-paste the White Helmets supplied narrative that enables an escalation in military aggression in support of the sectarian, extremist occupiers of civilian areas in Syria.

To what degree does the tail wag the dog? Are the U.K, U.S. and France genuinely in control of the White Helmet narratives, do they communicate with co-ordinators on the ground when they feel it is most convenient to receive news of a chemical attack? Or, do the White Helmets take control at times when they feel threatened, in order to trigger international reactions?

The importance given to the protection of the White Helmets by UN agencies, was condemned by Dr Bashar Al Jaafari, Syrian permanent representative to the UN, on the 16th March.

“He warned that giving the opportunity for terrorist groups, including the so-called “White Helmets” which are affiliated to Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist organization, to use the Security Council as a podium constitutes a flagrant violation of UNSC resolutions, particularly those related to combating terrorism, adding “the biggest scandal is that a UN agency operating in Damascus demanded the evacuation of 76 members of White Helmets from Eastern Ghouta, while paying no attention to the lives of thousands of civilians.”

HRW (Human Rights Watch) who, by their own admission, rely heavily upon the White Helmets for their evidence in Syria, reported on March 17th that they had received a distress call from the White Helmets claiming a number of them were surrounded by the SAA and were fearing “summary execution”.

White Helmets had issued similar reports during the final hours of the liberation of East Aleppo. Owen Jones of The Guardian repeated those stories without hesitation at the time. I was on the ground in Aleppo during liberation and again in Eastern Ghouta. Any White Helmets or armed factions who took Amnesty, were evacuated safely with their families to Idlib.

The April 7th Douma alleged chemical attack was also dismissed as a non-chemical bombing by medical staff who treated victims in the Douma Medical Point. This was reported by Robert Fisk and by a number of other journalists, independent and mainstream who visited the site, including myself.

Despite the clear possibility of this being another misreported “chemical attack”, the corporate media seemed to suffer from selective amnesia in their usual rush to judgement that provided cover for the U.S, U.K and France to unlawfully bomb Syria on the 14th April. This amnesia also covers the existence of chemical weapon manufacturing facilities under the control of the extremist groups across Eastern Ghouta, including Jaish Al Islam in Douma.

…

When we take into consideration the uniformity of narrative across the inter-connecting groups and support groups, including western media, it is hard not to conclude that truth is indeed the first casualty of war, brought to it’s knees by a narrative building apparatus that is ultimately financed and constructed by the hostile government agencies that benefit most from a contrived account of events on the ground in Syria.

The #UK Decision at the @OPCW Conference of State Parties has passed with votes 82 in favour (24 No). The international community has come together to strengthen the ban against chemical weapons use. #CSPSS4 #NoToChemicalWeapons pic.twitter.com/9vtGthXzWx — UK Delegation OPCW (@UK_OPCW) June 27, 2018

The new powers granted to the OPCW to attribute blame will surely lead to a further increase in “chemical attack” claims from the White Helmets and associated militant and terrorist groups still occupying rapidly dwindling areas of southern Syria and in Idlib which will soon be the focus of the SAA campaign to cleanse Syria of the foreign invaders.

21st Century Wire says…

Can you believe this train wreck of ‘legislative oversight,’ tweets, likes and emojis? Are taxpayers actually funding this elaborate, neverending charade?



Make up your own caption: ‘Yes Senator, I wore my best beard and nose ring today.’

It’s not enough that these social media giants have prostrated themselves and become willing dongles to the government. Now, their milktoast executive leaders must fly to Washington and sit through a monotonous receiving line of questions from fanboy and fangirl politicians looking to get social media mentions in the ‘fight against Russia.’ Incredible.

Tom ‘Tough Guy’ Cotton

It’s embarrassing and shameful to watch U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) grandstand like a first class fascist, as he attempts to ‘lean in’ on Facebook and Twitter and openly advocate for censorship, and the closure of Wikileaks.

In response to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s weak lament about ’24/7 global surveillance’, NeoHawk Cotton had this to say:

“Is Twitter an American company? … Do you prefer to see America remain the world’s dominant global superpower?”

What on earth are you talking about senator? This isn’t a reboot of the ‘red scare’ 1950s. Or is it? And about that Google thing: Tom, don’t worry, they’re still onside:



Auctioneering? Or, Auctioning Free Speech?

In something that could only be fit for a screwball comedy, U.S. Congressman Billy Long (R-MO) is heard mimicking an auctioneer in an attempt to drown out the heckling voice of political activist Laura Loomer. If you just landed on this planet, you might think the government was auctioning off free speech to the highest bidder at that exact moment.

Loomer can be heard shouting at Dorsey for censoring and shadow banning conservatives on his platform:



Rubbernecking: ‘Clown’ vs ‘Little Frat Boy’

One of the most entertaining and awkward moments happened in the hallways of the Capitol during the hearing, as Alex Jones of Infowars interview-crashed Marco Rubio’s press conference. The ineffectual Republican senator from Florida told Jones “I don’t know who you are” and the bombastic bullhorner later retorted calling Rubio “a little gangster thug.”

Update: Just 24 hours after Jones attended the hearing as a front row spectator and live streamed throughout the day, Twitter announced this afternoon it was permanently banning him and Infowars from its platform.

We chose this clip, created by RT, because of its high production value for your viewing pleasure:

Other lowlights: Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), an avid Russiagater, who’s no stranger to collusion, made it a point to show an empty seat with Google’s name on it and make a public example out of the search giant. Meanwhile, Senator Angus King (I-ME) suggested to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg that the social media giant should seriously consider a ‘banner or star’ rating to warn people of content they won’t like.

You can watch the full hearing from Wednesday, and join the collective facepalm.

So here’s to the grandstanders – the ones we elect and pay to represent us – they would rather play schoolyard politics and gain popularity than defend liberty. Absolutely and utterly pathetic.

It’s becoming all too clear where the global censorship effort is headed. With tech giants now a willing dongle to government, the infrastructure is in place to decide what is ‘foreign interference’ and who will be taken down next. Now, a legal framework to scale it out to the masses is being planned.

As seen earlier today in The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain and the United States, also known as the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence partners, want more access and authority to target Internet users that “sow discord, manipulate public discourse, bias the development of policy, or disrupt markets.” The article continues:

“Foreign interference threatens a nation’s sovereignty, values and national interests — it can limit or shape the polity’s ability to make independent judgements, erode public confidence in our political and government institutions, and interfere with private-sector decision making,” a joint communiqué read. “While senior digital industry representatives did not accept our invitation to participate in discussions on pressing issues regarding the illicit use of online spaces, we reiterated the need for digital industry to take more responsibility for content promulgated and communicated through their platforms and applications.” The communiqué also asserted an “urgent need for law enforcement to gain targeted access to data” subject to legal safeguards and for providers to voluntarily assist with investigations.

During the Gold Coast meeting, the group also referenced ‘hostile nations’ in the context of online platforms – a term that gets tossed around endlessly but nobody really knows what it’s supposed to represent. To this day, there has been no hard evidence presented to the public, for example, proving the Russian government colluded or interfered in the 2016 US Presidential Election.

We’ve even witnessed 21WIRE and many of our colleagues in alternative and independent media labeled ridiculously as ‘agents of the Kremlin’ for simply reporting the truth and informing the public of the news and information not being covering in the mainstream corporate-owned media.

Given that many of us are citizens of the ‘Five Eyes’ countries, are we to be considered foreign hostile actors interfering with domestic politics?

It’s time to reclaim the conversation and expose this for what it is: digital tyranny.

According to witnesses who were present at the meeting – a private conversation with Australian news publishers and broadcasters, Facebook’s head of news partnerships told the group that if they do not work with Facebook that their businesses would die.

The comment is totally at odds with the effect that Facebook claims to have on journalism. At the meeting, the Facebook executive in question had been speaking about “revitalizing journalism”, and later stated that “our goal at Facebook — what the team works on every day with publishers and reporters around the world — is to help journalism succeed and thrive, both on our platform and off.”

A senior Facebook executive has privately admitted Mark Zuckerberg “doesn’t care” about publishers and warned that if they did not work with the social media giant, 'I’ll be holding your hands with your dying business like in a ­hospice' https://t.co/DBVW7aFPhb — The Australian (@australian) August 12, 2018

Although Facebook has demonstrated a pattern of removing or blocking content from its website, the news last week that Alex Jones’ InfoWars media outlet had been removed from a number of social media platforms (including Facebook) has caused renewed interest in the topic of internet censorship. It has also highlighted the market dominance of Facebook, Google and YouTube, which collectively with the mainstream media, now control a dangerous proportion of the information consumers are accessing.

It is noteworthy that Australia’s competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), is currently investigating whether Facebook and Google “have disrupted the news media market to the detriment of publishers and consumers.”

The news that Facebook is telling news publishers that they will die should they decide not to work with the platform is not only shocking — it reeks of being a bona fide threat. The only thing missing from these reports is a line from The Godfather; after all, this sounds like an offer these publishers can’t refuse, or they might find themselves sleeping with the fishes.

It is even more shocking when we consider the source. There is no small degree of irony in the fact that the Facebook executive who made the comments, Campbell Brown, had previously been a TV news reporter and anchor. Ms Brown, who built her career at NBC News before moving to CNN, won an Emmy for her coverage of Hurricane Katrina and anchored shows on both networks. As a former successful and high-profile journalist, she might be expected to understand the concept and the value of a free press. Would that be too much to ask?

During a closed-door and off-the-record meeting last week, top Facebook executive Campbell Brown reportedly warned news publishers that refusal to cooperate with the tech behemoth’s efforts to “revitalize journalism” will leave media outlets dying “like in a hospice.”

Reported first by The Australian under a headline which read “Work With Facebook or Die: Zuckerberg,” the social media giant has insisted the comments were taken out of context, even as five individuals who attended the four-hour meeting corroborated what Brown had stated.

“Mark doesn’t care about publishers but is giving me a lot of leeway and concessions to make these changes,” Brown reportedly said, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. “We will help you revitalize journalism… in a few years the reverse looks like I’ll be holding hands with your dying business like in a hospice.”

As The Guardian reported on Monday, Facebook is “vehemently” denying the veracity of the comments as reported by The Australian, referring to its own transcript of the meeting. However, Facebook is refusing to release its transcript and tape of the gathering.

Brown’s warning about the dire prospects for news outlets that don’t get on board with a future in which corporate giants like Facebook are the arbiters of what is and isn’t trustworthy news comes as progressives are raising alarm that Facebook’s entrance into the world of journalism poses a major threat to non-corporate and left-wing news outlets…

21WIRE says…

The recent “deplatforming” of Alex Jones and InfoWars from a number of social media sites is just the tip of a much larger iceberg. It is not hard to see that we are entering a future in which the removal of social media and other internet content will be influenced and carried out, not only by big tech firms such as YouTube and Facebook, but by politicians, foreign and domestic governments and social media users, as well as other private interests.

Although the simultaneous removal of Alex Jones from multiple platforms has grabbed headlines in both the mainstream press and independent media, in truth these moves have been underway for some time. As pointed out in the article below, the current movement to censor the internet can be partly traced back to events in Congress last November, when the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings targeting “Extremist Content and Russian Disinformation Online.”

In this sense, it is not only the social media companies themselves which are participating in this censorship; the hand of the state is also present to instigate it, pressuring the platforms to do it so that politicians are at least somewhat insulated from accusations of censorship.

There is also an international dimension to these moves, as various attempts to control internet content have taken place in countries as diverse as China, Israel and the Great Britain. In the UK, Prime Minister Theresa May has been pressuring Silicon Valley to control content since even before the London Bridge attack in June 2017 when she declared war on online extremism.

Even here at 21WIRE we are not immune from this type of pressure and control. As we reported last year, changes to Google’s search algorithms caused a substantial and ongoing decrease in traffic coming to this website, and hundreds of others like it. Many sites in the independent/alternative media are suffering a similar fate — on both the left and the right. This is well documented now. The common factor among them seems to be their dissent from establishment narratives.

The Rolling Stone article reposted below does a good job of drawing attention to a number of these issues. However, as The Intercept‘s Glenn Greenwald highlights in the following tweets responding to the piece, the future may be grim. Not only will we see rival camps competing to censor their rivals’ content, but we are now on a course toward Chinese-style control and censorship, which unabashedly and directly silences political opposition.

The last thing Greenwald highlights from the Rolling Stone piece is that Americans “have lost the ability to distinguish between general principles and political outcomes.” In other words, freedom of speech is in grave danger, if it isn’t already gone. As is often stated, popular speech needs no protection. Therefore if we as a society do not protect unpopular speech, then we do not have free speech at all.

More on this from Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi…

Matt Taibbi

Rolling Stone

Silicon Valley is changing its mind about censorship.

Two weeks ago, we learned about a new campaign against “inauthentic” content, conducted by Facebook in consultation with Congress and the secretive think tank Atlantic Council — whose board includes an array of ex-CIA and Homeland Security officials — in the name of cracking down on alleged Russian disinformation efforts.­ As part of the bizarre alliance of Internet news distributors and quasi-government censors, the social network zapped 32 accounts and pages, including an ad for a real “No Unite the Right 2” anti-racist counter-rally in D.C. this past weekend.

“This is a real protest in Washington, D.C. It is not George Soros. It is not Russia. It is just us,” said the event’s organizers, a coalition of easily located Americans, in a statement.

Last week, we saw another flurry of censorship news. Facebook apparently suspended VenezuelaAnalysis.com, a site critical of U.S. policy toward Venezuela. (It was reinstated Thursday.) Twitter suspended a pair of libertarians, including @DanielLMcAdams of the Ron Paul Institute and @ScottHortonShow of Antiwar.com, for using the word “bitch” (directed toward a man) in a silly political argument. They, too, were later re-instated.

More significantly: Google’s former head of free expression issues in Asia, Lokman Tsui, blasted the tech giant’s plan to develop a search engine that would help the Chinese government censor content.

First reported by The Intercept, the plan was called “a stupid, stupid move” by Tsui, who added: “I can’t see a way to operate Google search in China without violating widely held international human rights standards.” This came on the heels of news that the Israeli Knesset passed a second reading of a “Facebook bill,” authorizing courts to delete content on security grounds.

Few Americans heard these stories, because the big “censorship” news last week surrounded the widely hated Alex Jones. After surviving halting actions by Facebook and YouTube the week before, the screeching InfoWars lunatic was hit decisively, removed from Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify.

Jones is the media equivalent of a trench-coated stalker who jumps out from behind a mailbox and starts whacking it in an intersection. His “speech” is on that level: less an idea than a gross physical provocation. InfoWars defines everything reporters are taught not to do.

Were I Alex Jones, I would think Alex Jones was a false-flag operation, cooked up to discredit the idea of a free press.

Moreover, Jones probably does violate all of those platforms’ Terms of Service. I personally don’t believe his Sandy Hook rants — in which he accused grieving parents of being actors in an anti-gun conspiracy — are protected speech, at least not according to current libel and defamation law. Even some conservative speech activists seem to agree.

And yet: I didn’t celebrate when Jones was banned. Collectively, all these stories represent a revolutionary moment in media. Jones is an incidental player in a much larger narrative.

Both the Jones situation and the Facebook-Atlantic Council deletions seem an effort to fulfill a request made last year by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Last October, Facebook, Google and Twitter were asked by Hawaii Senator Mazie Hizono to draw up a “mission statement” to “prevent the foment of discord.”

Companies like Facebook might have balked before. They have long taken a position that’s very Star Trek, very Prime-Directive: We do not interfere. Mark Zuckerberg, as late as 2016, was saying, “editing content… that’s not us.”

Part of this reluctance was probably ideological, but the main thing was the sheer logistical quandary of monitoring published content on the scale of a firm like Facebook. The company now has 2.23 billion users, and experts estimate that’s more than a billion new entries to monitor daily.

Although it might have seemed minor, undertaking what Facebook did prior to 2016 — keeping porn and beheading videos out of your news feed — was an extraordinarily involved technical process.

This was underscored by fiascoes like the “Napalm Girl” incident in 2016, when the firm deleted a picture of Kim Phúc, the nine-year-old Vietnamese girl photographed running from napalm in 1972. The iconic picture helped reverse global opinion about the Vietnam War.

Facebook ultimately put the photo back up after being ripped for “abusing its power.” This was absurd: The photo had been flagged by mostly automated processes, designed to keep naked pictures of pre-teens off the site.

As a former Facebook exec tells Rolling Stone: “Knowing that ‘Napalm Girl’ is one of the icons of international journalism isn’t part of the fucking algo.”

It would seem like madness to ask companies to expand that vast automated process to make far more difficult intellectual distinctions about journalistic quality. But that has happened.

After Trump’s shocking win in 2016, everyone turned to Facebook and Google to fix “fake news.” But nobody had a coherent definition of what constitutes it.

Many on the left lamented the Wikileaks releases of Democratic Party emails, but those documents were real news, and the complaint there was more about the motives of sources, and editorial emphasis, rather than accuracy…

With all the public furor about Cambridge Analytica the corporate media and political establishment has extremely careful to avoid mentioning the role of the George Soros-funded radical left-wing political organization Media Matters in data mining and advising social media monopolists on how to restrict content on their platforms under the cover of “fighting fake news”.

As it turns out, there is a clear, politically bias agenda which governs Facebook and others censorship algorithms. What these companies are doing is actually illegal and unconstitutional according to US law, but Washington’s corrupt political management class are afraid to hold Silicon Valley accountable – because the two parties are working together to the same authoritarian ends.

President Trump has signed a bill into law that cancels those regulations and could eventually allow internet service providers (ISPs) to sell information about their customers’ sensitive private data.

The law revokes regulations that would have required ISPs to obtain customer permission before collecting and sharing customer data such as web browsing history, app usage, geo-location data, and social security numbers; to notify customers about the type of information collected and shared; and to strengthen safeguards for customer data against hackers and thieves.

Under the new law, ISPs can monitor their users’ online activities and, without the users’ permission, sell highly targeted ads, and also sell the information to third parties such as marketers, financial firms, and other companies that gather personal data.

ISPs such as Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon opposed the FCC regulations as unfair and harsh because tech companies such as Facebook and Google would not have been subject to the regulations, leaving them free to collect user information without permission.

262020de1f5e4294979e94ed729d475e	['Pbspot Admin', 'Will Phoenix', 'Navy Corpseman']		President Trump and the Alt-right : Political Blind Spot	http://politicalblindspot.com/	US	President Trump and the Alt-right : Political Blind Spot	0	"In 2010, the term “alt-right” entered the political lexicon. It referred to a movement centered on white nationalism.

A few days after President Trump’s inauguration, a TV reporter was told by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer, “Trump is a white nationalist, so to speak. He is alt-right whether he likes it or not.” A brief review of Trump’s actions during the first 100 days of his presidency seem to validate Spencer’s comment.

Many of Trump’s policies, intentionally or unintentionally, coincide with the white nationalist agenda. He has signed executive orders to begin building a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico; to withhold federal funds from “sanctuary cities” that refuse to use local police to enforce federal immigration laws; and to suspended indefinitely the entry of Syrian refugees and temporarily barred citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. The last two orders were not upheld in court. His administration has directed federal prosecutors to bring more felony charges against detained immigrants.

Trump has rescinded the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order which requires federal contractors to show they are in compliance with federal law prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people.

Some of Trump’s appointees hold views that are more radical right than mainstream. Among them are strategist Stephen Bannon, who turned Breitbart News into the platform for the alt-right; and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was denied a federal judgeship because of his racism and who was a powerful ally of anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim extremist groups when he was U.S. senator from Alabama.

Sessions has indicated he will not continue the Justice Department’s work to curb discriminatory policing practices, will not attempt to reform sentencing laws for drug related crimes, and will discontinue the previous administration’s policy of reducing the federal government’s use of prisons operated by private, for-profit companies. Black Americans are disproportionately affected by these practices.

Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke tweeted on January 31: “Everything I’ve been talking about for decades is coming true and the ideas I’ve fought for have won.”

c14f60f0103f4f7993987311928a009e	['Pbspot Admin', 'Will Phoenix', 'Navy Corpseman']		Education Secretary Booed at Black College Commencement : Political Blind Spot	http://politicalblindspot.com/	US	Education Secretary Booed at Black College Commencement : Political Blind Spot	0	"An unwelcome reception awaited U.S. Secretary Betsy DeVos as she delivered the commencement address on May 5 at Bethune-Cookman University (B-CU), a historically black college in Daytona Beach, Florida. B-CU has a student population of approximately 3,600.

Prior to DeVos’ arrival, a group delivered petitions with about 60,000 signatures asking B-CU officials to cancel her speech, and there had been a demonstration protesting her appearance with some protesters holding signs that read “DeVos No” and “Our tax $s pay for public education.” Prior to the commencement ceremony, activists lined the sidewalk outside the convention center where the event occurred. Some carried signs, one of which read “DeVos is not worthy.”

During the program, as B-CU President began to award DeVos an honorary degree, many students started to boo. More than half of the 380 graduates stood and turned their backs to her as she was introduced, and a dozen remained so during her entire speech. Seconds after she began delivering her speech, loud shouts filled the room. Some graduating students shouted “Liar!” and “Just go.” At times, the shouts were so loud DeVos could not be heard.

When DeVos said she wanted to “acknowledge the different life experiences” of those in the crowd, students responded with chants of “hell, nah.” When DeVos announced that later in the day she would visit the home and gravesite of B-CU founder Mary Bethune to pay her respects, another round of boos occurred, accompanied by some shouts of “No!” Although the commencement program indicated DeVos would speak for more than an hour, she ended her address after about 20 minutes.

One reason for the protest against DeVos as commencement speaker is her statement in February that founders of historically black colleges and universities were “real pioneers” of school choice. Actually, the schools were founded out of necessity during the era of segregation when black students were prohibited from attending white colleges. DeVos has recanted the statement, conceding that racism was the impetus for establishment of historically black colleges.

DeVos is also criticized for diverting tax money from public schools to private and charter schools, for reducing consumer protections for student loan repayment and amnesty programs, and for her past negative remarks on public education. Many B-CU students are graduates of public schools and depend on student loans to help finance their college education.

A graduate who received a master’s degree said, “DeVos was here to hear our differences and at the end of the day I think that’s what happened.”

612f8ff7d5ef483aab5c699be1d6df5e	['Pbspot Admin', 'Will Phoenix', 'Navy Corpseman']		Trump Gave Secret Information to Russians : Political Blind Spot	http://politicalblindspot.com/	US	Trump Gave Secret Information to Russians : Political Blind Spot	0	"According to former and current U.S. officials, President Trump disclosed highly classified information to a Russian Foreign Minister and Ambassador to U.S. during a meeting with the Russian dignitaries in the Oval Office. The information is so sensitive that details have not been shared with allies and have been restricted within the U.S. government. It is described as “code-word” information, referring to the highest classification level that American information (spy) agencies use.

Immediately after the meeting, White House officials tried to minimize the damage by alerting the CIA and the National Security Agency. They hoped to prevent hostility from the source.

At one point during the meeting, Trump seemed to be bragging, saying, “I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day.” He then described details about how ISIS plans to use laptop computers as bombs on planes, and although he did not share the specific intelligence gathering method, he did indicate the city within ISIS territory where the information was obtained. Additional information about the content of the President’s disclosure is not being published for reasons of national security.

The incident gave officials several reasons for concern. First, Trump discussed parts of the plan that were known to the U.S only because of the efforts of a key U.S. intelligence partner; by sharing the information, Trump placed the provider of that information in danger since Russia may be able to figure out the source.

A second concern is that exposure of this important source of information about the Islamic State could become an obstacle to the ability of the U.S. and U.S. allies to find out about future threats. There is also concern that the President compromised national security by reducing the likelihood that U.S. allies will share intelligence with Washington.

Another concern is that the incident may erode the trust essential for sharing information. Rules of espionage hold that governments and individual agencies decide how and to whom information they gather is distributed, even after it is shared. Trump violated this rule: The information was not his to share.

Since one of the powers of the President is to declassify information at any time he chooses, the President did not break any laws and so it is not likely that he will be legally prosecuted for this extremely serious breach of protocol.

President Trump indicated early on that he plans to retain his presidency: he filed his intention to run for re-election on January 20, the day he was inaugurated. By Filing, early Trump can accept campaign contributions throughout his current term. He has already set up a re-election committee and his campaign released the first ad of the 2020 campaign.

According to NPR, the 2016 election may have been the beginning of a new tendency in presidential elections in which the experience of holding public office or of being a public servant is no longer required. Instead, wealth, power, and celebrity are considered acceptable qualifications.

It is also noted by NPR that presidential elections have become treated like reality shows and give presidential candidates too much attention compared to the actual power they have. Concomitantly, lower-level, closer-to-home elections receive much less attention from voters and the media.

The majority of those persons filing for the 2020 presidential campaign are activists, but there are also business persons and a Hollywood actor with no political experience.

Rumored to be among Trump’s Democratic challengers are Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, and Cory Booker of New Jersey. Names of wealthy non-politicians rumored to be contenders for the presidency include Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and former Starbucks’ CEO Howard Schultz. Others rumored to be interesting in running for the presidency include rapper and entrepreneur Kanye West, and professional wrestler and actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.

fd98d950732e486eb0f53999ef06ff3f	['Pbspot Admin', 'Will Phoenix', 'Navy Corpseman']		The REAL ‘Lone Ranger’ Was An African American Lawman Who Lived With Native American Indians : Political Blind Spot	http://politicalblindspot.com/	US	The REAL ‘Lone Ranger’ Was An African American Lawman Who Lived With Native American Indians : Political Blind Spot	0	"The real “Lone Ranger,” it turns out, was an African American man named Bass Reeves, who the legend was based upon. Perhaps not surprisingly, many aspects of his life were written out of the story, including his ethnicity. The basics remained the same: a lawman hunting bad guys, accompanied by a Native American, riding on a white horse, and with a silver trademark.

Historians of the American West have also, until recently, ignored the fact that this man was African American, a free black man who headed West to find himself less subject to the racist structure of the established Eastern and Southern states.

While historians have largely overlooked Reeves, there have been a few notable works on him. Vaunda Michaux Nelson’s book, Bad News for Outlaws: The Remarkable Life of Bass Reeves, Deputy U.S. Marshal, won the 2010 Coretta Scott King Award for best author. Arthur Burton released an overview of the man’s life a few years ago. Black Gun, Silver Star: The Life and Legend of Frontier Marshal Bass Reeves recounts that Reeves was born into a life of slavery in 1838. His slave-keeper brought him along as another personal servant when he went off to fight with the Confederate Army, during the Civil War.

Reeves took the chaos that ensued during the war to escape for freedom, after beating his “master” within an inch of his life, or according to some sources, to death. Perhaps the most intruiging thing about this escape was that Reeves only beat his enslaver after the latter lost sorely at a game of cards with Reeves and attacked him.

After successfully defending himself from this attack, he knew that there was no way he would be allowed to live if he stuck around.

Reeves fled to the then Indian Territory of today’s Oklahoma and lived harmoniously among the Seminole and Creek Nations of Native American Indians.

After the Civil War finally concluded, he married and eventually fathered ten children, making his living as a Deputy U.S. Marshall in Arkansas and the Indian Territory. If this surprises you, it should, as Reeves was the first African American to ever hold such a position.

Burton explains that it was at this point that the Lone Ranger story comes in to play. Reeves was described as a “master of disguises”. He used these disguises to track down wanted criminals, even adopting similar ways of dressing and mannerisms to meet and fit in with the fugitives, in order to identify them.

Reeves kept and gave out silver coins as a personal trademark of sorts, just like the Lone Ranger’s silver bullets. Of course, the recent Disney adaptation of the Lone Ranger devised a clever and meaningful explanation for the silver bullets in the classic tales. For the new Lone Ranger, the purposes was to not wantonly expend ammunition and in so doing devalue human life. But in the original series, there was never an explanation given, as this was simply something originally adapted from Reeves’ personal life and trademarking of himself. For Reeves, it had a very different meaning, he would give out the valuable coins to ingratiate himself to the people wherever he found himself working, collecting bounties. In this way, a visit from the real “Lone Ranger” meant only good fortune for the town: a criminal off the street and perhaps a lucky silver coin.

Like the Lone Ranger, Reeves was also expert crack shot with a gun. According to legend, shooting competitions had an informal ban on allowing him to enter. Like the Lone Ranger, Reeves rode a white horse throughout almost all of his career, at one point riding a light grey one as well.

Like the famed Lone Ranger legend Reeves had his own close friend like Tonto. Reeves’ companion was a Native American posse man and tracker who he often rode with, when he was out capturing bad guys. In all, there were close to 3000 of such criminals they apprehended, making them a legendary duo in many regions.

The final proof that this legend of Bass Reeves directly inspired into the story of the Lone Ranger can be found in the fact that a large number of those criminals were sent to federal prison in Detroit. The Lone Ranger radio show originated and was broadcast to the public in 1933 on WXYZ in Detroit where the legend of Reeves was famous only two years earlier.

Of course, WXYZ and the later TV and movie adaptions weren’t about to make the Lone Ranger an African American who began his career by beating a slave-keeper to death. But now you know. Spread the word and let people know the real legend of the Lone Ranger.

755c132b4ec8487cb85553088dfb1bae	['Will Phoenix', 'Navy Corpseman']		Data Reveals Measles Outbreaks Have Nothing to Do With Non-Vaccination Trends : Political Blind Spot	http://politicalblindspot.com/	US	Data Reveals Measles Outbreaks Have Nothing to Do With Non-Vaccination Trends : Political Blind Spot	0	"Whatever we might each think about the decision to not vaccinate ourselves or our children, one thing is clear: vaccination is a heated topic and debates about it often result in polarization. Maybe another thing is clear too: most opinions about vaccination (for or against) are influenced more by editorials on the subject, than by data itself. Thus, here is one more editorial on the subject, albeit one that does not pass judgment on vaccinations, for or against. It is, instead, intended as a call to research, and a reminder of the scientific maxim: correlation is not causation. That goes for both sides of this debate.

On the anti-vaccination side, there are many claims made that are often based on things that the data might imply, but is far from proving. This results in many ideas that are later discredited being circulated as fact.

On the pro-vaccination side, every time there is a measles outbreak, it seems mainstream news outlets trip over themselves to implicate “the growing trend to opt out of vaccinations” as the cause (read: causation). Again, “correlation is not causation”. Here’s why…

If the measles outbreaks in California, and particularly in and around Orange County, as well as New York City are because of non-vaccinators, then why aren’t we seeing outbreaks of everything not being vaccinated for? Why just measles and why all of a sudden, when the number of people opting out of vaccinations has actually steadily dropped in the last few years – after an initial wave of people not doing it?

Non-vaccinators in NY are .1-1% of the population. In California we are talking 1.1-2%. Why aren’t we seeing increases in outbreaks in Vermont, Michigan and Oregon where the rate is over 6%? Correlation (or worse yet, public perception of correlation), is not causation: whether it’s vaccines and autism, or whether it’s a tiny number of people not vaccinating, and a few places having measles outbreaks.

What does the data show on measles in the states where opting out of vaccination trends the highest? There was an instance in Oregon last year, and one this year with a 6% rate of opting out in the state. A child in Washington County, Oregon who developed measles on an overseas trip and exposed hundreds of people in the Portland area. Add to that one case in Oregon this year where a child contracted measles from a vaccinated adult.

Shouldn’t the state be the worst off? And where are Vermont’s outbreaks at 6% non-vaccination?

Measles has been trending down, but in the past year it has spiked in the U.S. in spite of the trend of non-vaccination dropping a bit. Measles outbreaks have been happening all over the world in the past year, even and especially where there is no significant increase of anti-vaccination trends (Turkey, Vietnam, Philippines and several countries in Europe). It’s up in California which likely is accounted for by the fact that there is so much travel in California from abroad. The 2013 case in Oregon? That was a traveller too, who had been in and out of international airports before contracting the disease. Same thing with New York City where outbreaks have been happening at a rate higher than the statistical norm.

States with the highest non-vaccination rates have not seen an increase in measles outbreaks that are statistically significant. News websites like to run with headlines that will get people to share, and vent outrage. But that doesn’t make such articles a good source of scientific data.

Remember, if you take nothing else away from this: correlation is not causation. Just because you heard on the news that there are a lot of people not vaccinating their children (an exaggerated statement, to be sure), does not mean that the rise in measles globally is due to families in Utah refusing vaccinations across the board. This is all the more so when the correlation does not even overlap the places where vaccine refusal is the highest.

Do some research. Use the search field on the CDC website. Hit your local University library up and search scholarly journals and databases. The data on these issues is not hiding, but it will not deliver itself to your email inbox without a little work. When you do the research you’ll find that the facts are not quite as sensational as many headlines might have you believe. There has been a recent spike in measles. That much is clear. But it is happening all over the world and it is actually not happening in places where people are refusing vaccinations the most. Whatever your position is on vaccinations, get the facts and don’t spread assumptions made by lazy writers. Again, that goes for both sides of the vaccination issue.
